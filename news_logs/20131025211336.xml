      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Jack Straw to quit at next election</title>
      <description>Jack Straw is to stand down as Labour MP for Blackburn at the next general election, he announces.</description>

      <body>Jack Straw is to stand down as MP for Blackburn at the next general election. The former Labour home and foreign secretary 67, was elected in Blackburn in 1979 and has stood in eight general elections in the constituency. He said his "love affair" with the town was "not going to end on 7 May 2015, nor is my connection with it." Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mr Straw's "eloquence and wisdom" and said he "will continue to serve our country in many different ways". Mr Straw said: "Whatever national position I have held, the citizens of this town, and their children, have always been my first priority. "I am deeply grateful to everyone in the town for the faith which has been placed in me." But he said he had made the decision to stand down after a great deal of thought and consultation with friends and family. He added he "couldn't go on forever" and it would be "a terrible wrench" to stand down. Mr Straw held the positions of home secretary, foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons under Tony Blair. Gordon Brown made him justice secretary in June 2007, a position he held until Labour's defeat at the 2010 election. Mr Miliband said: "Jack Straw will be greatly missed from the House of Commons. "On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to thank him for his nearly 35 years service as an MP, his achievements in government and his eloquence and wisdom. "He is Labour through and through, and always displayed this in his words and deeds. "He will be sorely missed but I know he will continue to serve our country in many different ways." Mr Straw practised as a criminal barrister before entering the Commons and was an adviser to Labour minister Barbara Castle, his predecessor as Blackburn MP. </body>

      <title>Mosque bomber given life for murder</title>
      <description>Ukrainian student Pavlo Lapshyn is jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and carrying out a series of mosque bombings.</description>

      <body>A Ukrainian student has been jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and plotting explosions near mosques in racist attacks. Pavlo Lapshyn stabbed Mohammed Saleem in Small Heath, Birmingham on 29 April, five days after arriving in the UK. On Monday, Lapshyn, 25, admitted murder as well as plotting to cause explosions near mosques in Walsall, Tipton and Wolverhampton in June and July. At the Old Bailey, he was told he would be jailed for life. Mr Saleem was stabbed to death, just yards from his home, after attending prayers at his local mosque in Green Lane. Lapshyn, from Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine, was living in Birmingham while on a temporary work placement in the city when he killed Mr Saleem, a grandfather of 22. He later planted three bombs near mosques in the West Midlands as part of a campaign he said was motivated by racial hatred. He was arrested almost a week after an explosion in Tipton. The third device, which exploded near the Kanzul Iman mosque in Tipton on 12 July, was packed with nails. Police said it was only because Lapshyn got the wrong time for Friday prayers that the blast did not cause mass injuries. Sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: "You clearly hold extremist right-wing, white supremacist views and you were motivated to commit the offences by religious and racial hatred in the hope that you would ignite racial conflict and cause Muslims to leave the area where you were living. "Such views, hatred and motivations have no place whatsoever in our multi-faith and multi-cultural society." He added Lapshyn held "views abhorrent to all right-thinking people which have no place in our multi-cultural society". During interviews, Lapshyn told police he had murdered the grandfather of 22 because he hated "non-whites". Prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the Old Bailey that PhD student Lapshyn had come to the UK on a work placement with software company Delcam. The firm's sponsorship programme in partnership with the National Metallurgy Academy in Ukraine is now under review following his crimes. Lapshyn's apartment, above Delcam's offices in Birmingham, were raided by police who found chemicals and bomb-making equipment for another three devices. They also discovered a camera containing 455 photographs and 98 videos. Some of them showed Lapshyn detonating homemade bombs in the Ukrainian countryside. The camera also included shots of him making bombs. The force's anti-terrorism unit also discovered apparent anonymous notes in the apartment which he planned to use to taunt police. One featured a photograph of the hunting knife, next to which Lapshyn had written "Mohammed Saleem was killed by". He also referred to a police reward for information, saying "£10,000 small price, maybe £1m", followed by a smiley face, and the phrase "white power". The court heard Lapshyn had a video game on his laptop called Ethnic Cleansing and also posed for white a supremacist website with the knife. Defending, Richard Atkins QC said "we accept that his crimes are grave" and "the appropriate penalty we submit is life with a substantial minimum term". Mr Atkins told the court that Lapshyn is being kept in segregation and that the only person he speaks to regularly is his father. In an interview with the BBC, Lapshyn's father, Sergey Lapshyn, said he did not believe his son was a racist. "Among his acquaintances were people of different ethnic backgrounds, and I have never seen that (racism)," he said. He added his son could be "a bit tight-lipped" but was not calculating, as police had described him. Speaking from his home in Dnepropetrovsk, Lapshyn's father confirmed his own mother was a Muslim during her childhood. Lapshyn's father said his son knew his grandmother was a member of the (largely Muslim) Tatar community at the time of the former Soviet Union. "We never discussed religious problems and we always considered them to be very intimate," he said. Mr Saleem's family said their father had not done anything to deserve to die, other than be a Muslim. In a statement read out in court, Mr Saleem's daughter Shazia Khan said: "The shock and sadness of the reality is impossible to accept, yet alone accept and move on. "We can't move forward, the murder has disabled our minds in every emotional way possible." Speaking after the sentencing, Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale from West Midlands Police said Lapshyn was "very definitely driven by an extreme right-wing ideology and white supremacist ideology". Asked to describe Lapshyn's manner in police interview, he said: "He was matter-of-fact, he was cold, he was callous. "I do not think he has shown any remorse or regret for the crimes that have taken place." </body>

      <title>Teachers suspend planned strike</title>
      <description>A planned strike by teachers in England before Christmas is suspended after ministers agree to meet unions.</description>

      <body>Teachers in England are to suspend a planned national strike after ministers agreed to discuss the dispute. Two of the biggest teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT, had planned to stage a one-day walkout before Christmas in a row over pay, pensions and conditions. But they say a strike will be held by 13 February next year if the talks do not lead to progress. It comes after a series of regional strikes by teachers this year. In a statement, the unions announced Education Secretary Michael Gove had said he was "willing to discuss a basis for genuine talks". Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: "The public demonstration of the anger and frustration of teachers and the commitment of members to the action have secured the prospect of talks with the secretary of state. "We look forward to securing progress in these talks as quickly as possible." Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said: "The successful regional strikes already undertaken show the strength of teachers' anger and concerns about the changes being made to their profession. "We are giving government the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions with us to resolve our ongoing dispute. "We have always been available for such negotiations and would have preferred that this was a route the government had gone down sooner rather than later." Teachers are objecting to proposals by Mr Gove to bring in performance-related pay, make changes to their pensions and other changes which they say will increase their workloads. The first walkout was at the end of June in the north-west of England. Unions said 2,765 schools close or partially shut, across 22 authorities were affected. A strike on 1 October saw 2,500 schools affected across 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber. The most recent walkout on 17 October involved 3,5000 schools in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West. </body>

      <title>DNA test proves mystery girl parents</title>
      <description>DNA tests confirm a Bulgarian Roma couple as the parents of mystery child Maria, whose discovery in Greece last week made global news headlines.</description>

      <body>DNA tests have confirmed a Bulgarian Roma couple as the biological parents of mystery child Maria, found in Greece last week, Bulgarian officials say. They identified the couple as Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev. The officials are investigating whether the mother had sold the child - a claim she has denied. Maria was found at a Roma camp in central Greece. Police noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde girl and the adults she was staying with. The couple, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, have since been charged with child abduction. They have insisted the girl was given to them legitimately. Maria - who was found near Farsala, central Greece - is currently being cared for by the Athens-based charity The Smile of the Child. There have been thousands of inquiries following an appeal to identify her. The case has also sparked concern over prejudice and racism towards Roma people. The child's parents - Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev - and their eight children, had been filmed earlier by Bulgarian television at their home in the Roma district of the central town of Nikolaevo. Ms Ruseva, holding a child with red hair, told reporters that she and her husband had been working in the Greek city of Larisa four years ago when she gave birth to a girl. The girl was seven months old when they had to return to Bulgaria, and she said she could not afford to take the child with her. She said she was talking to a woman she worked with who told her: "Give me this child, I will take care of it. You can come and take it back any time you want. "But I had other children to take care of and I couldn't go... I have never got any money for it." Bulgarian officials said that during questioning, Ms Ruseva said she had recognised Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou as the people she had left her child with. Prosecutors have pressed preliminary charges against Ms Ruseva for "deliberately selling a child while residing out of the country". In Greece, a lawyer representing the couple in the Roma camp near Farsala said on Friday they planned to seek legal custody of Maria. "Provided what we said is borne out, that it was not an abduction, then logically they will be released from prison and they will be able to enter a proper [adoption] process," Costas Katsavos was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. "They truly and ardently want her back," he added. Maria's biological parents in Bulgaria also say they want to be re-united with her. However, the head of Bulgaria's social services department, Lidia Hristova, told Reuters: "After an investigation, we will decide what would be best for the child, whether to take her from the family, to offer social service, or so on." There will now be difficult questions for police both in Greece and Bulgaria, the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens reports. He adds that clearly there will still be a legal case against the Greek couple, and possibly against Maria's parents as well. But Greek police could be left red-faced for making the initial allegations of abduction, our correspondent adds. Greek news site zougla.gr has published what it says is Ms Ruseva's identity card and a birth certificate for Maria from a hospital in Lamia, not far from Farsala and Larisa. The birth certificate says the girl was born in January 2009. Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou have told police Maria was four years old, but the Smile of the Child charity say medical examinations suggest she is more like five or six. </body>

      <body>A small tsunami triggered by a quake has hit Japan's eastern coast - where the crippled Fukushima nuclear plant is located - but no damage is reported. The 30cm (1ft) waves reached the region after the 7.1 magnitude tremor struck at a depth of 10km (six miles), about 320km off the coast. A tsunami alert issued for several areas was later lifted. Workers at the Fukushima power station had been told to leave waterfront areas for higher ground. But a Fukushima spokesman later said there was no damage or change in readings at radiation monitoring posts around the plant, according to Reuters news agency. The Japan Meteorological Agency had warned that a small tsunami - up to one metre (3.3ft) - could reach the eastern coast after the tremor in the Pacific Ocean. The agency had also issued a "yellow" advisory for Fukushima and the prefectures of Iwate, Miyagi, Ibaraki and parts of Chiba. But it added: "Though there may be slight sea-level change in coastal regions, no tsunami damage is expected." The earthquake struck at about 02:10 local time on Saturday (17:10 GMT Friday). The tsunami advisory was lifted about two hours later. The Fukushima reactors were damaged by the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011. Since then, most of Japan's nuclear reactors have remained off, amid impassioned debate over nuclear energy. More than 18,000 people were left dead or missing in that disaster. </body>

      <description>Warnings of stormy weather in parts of England and Wales on Sunday night and Monday are extended to more areas.</description>

      <body>Warnings of stormy weather in England and Wales on Sunday night and Monday have been extended to more areas. A Met Office amber alert of high winds in southern Wales and southern England now includes much of the Midlands, the East, and London and the South East. People are being warned of the risk of falling trees and damage to buildings, with gusts of up to 80 mph (120 kph), possibly higher around exposed coasts There is also concern heavy rain could cause surface water flooding. A yellow alert predicting heavy rain on Monday covers the whole of England and Wales. It is the lowest level of the three warnings issued by the Met Office, and advises people to "be aware". An amber alert, advising people to "be prepared" for potentially hazardous conditions, is one level up from this. BBC Weather presenter Peter Gibbs said a strong Atlantic jet stream is providing the "driving force" for the storm, which is expected to hit central England and Wales UK late on Sunday night and run across the country in a north-eastwardly direction. The strongest winds are expected on the storms southern and western flanks. Forecasters say a "very intense low pressure system" brings the potential for strong winds, especially on exposed coasts in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent. Temperatures of up to 15C on Monday will be above average. The Met Office said "the public should be prepared for the risk of falling trees as well as damage to buildings and other structures, bringing disruption to transport and power supplies". But there is still some uncertainty as to exactly when the storm will reach the country. Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: "This storm doesn't exist at the moment, but our forecast models predict it is likely to develop in the west Atlantic on Saturday. "Then it's likely to rapidly intensify just west of the UK late on Sunday before tracking across England and Wales early on Monday. "There is still a chance this storm may take a more southerly track and miss the UK, bringing impacts elsewhere in northern Europe, but people should be aware there is a risk of severe weather and significant disruption." The AA said stormy conditions could cause "significant travel disruption on Monday morning... one of the busiest times on the roads". Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: "Strong wind and torrential rain is an unpredictable and hazardous combination, which can be quite overwhelming when you're driving. "There's likely to be tree and other debris on the roads as well potential flooding, so it's very important to keep your speed down and drive with great care." There is more information about the forecasts for Sunday and Monday on the BBC Weather and Met Office websites.

      <title>Cameron shares 'spying concerns'</title>
      <description>David Cameron says he shares the concerns of other EU leaders about alleged US spying but defends the UK's transatlantic intelligence relationship.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has said he shares the concerns of other EU leaders about claims that US intelligence agencies monitored the phone calls of Angela Merkel and other European politicians. The prime minister said a statement released by all 28 leaders saying that trust must be rebuilt between Europe and the US was "good and sensible". Reports he was forced to sign up to the text are wrong, the BBC understands. The PM also stressed the UK had a "unique" security alliance with the US. Allegations that US agencies engaged in widespread tapping of phone calls by prominent European politicians dominated the two-day European Council summit in Brussels. Germany has said it is unacceptable that an ally eavesdropped on conversations made by its chancellor and has made clear that co-operation between the two countries in this area must change in the future. French president Francois Hollande has said trust needed to be "restored and reinforced" following the revelations by whistle-blower Edward Snowden about the activities of the National Security Agency (NSA). Both leaders want talks with US officials later this year to agree an "understanding on mutual relations". Speaking at a press conference at the end of the summit, Mr Cameron said the EU wanted a "good partnership" with the US in all matters, including intelligence. "I think what Angela and Francois want to do is entirely sensible and other European countries are free to join in with that," he said. "I was very struck by my colleagues how they don't want some breach between the EU and the US." Defending the work of the UK security services, he said every country had to be satisfied that their operations were subject to proper oversight and the UK had "strengthened" its controls. "I am satisfied our intelligence agencies are properly governed. The work they do is very important. Every year they helped obstruct, put off, major terrorist attacks, in our country and other European countries too." He added: "Britain has a unique partnership with the USA (on security). For us we are in the right situation, but I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama." The Daily Telegraph has claimed that Mr Cameron was effectively forced to sign up to the joint statement on spying. But the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said the prime minister had offered his support, unprompted, during the news conference and the text of the statement only emerged during conversations over dinner on Thursday. However, it is understood conversations on the subject were uncomfortable for Mr Cameron. Asked about separate claims that the UK had eavesdropped on the conversations of Italian politicians, Mr Cameron said he could not comment on specific national security matters. But he insisted that the UK's security services operated within the legal framework and pointed out that Britain shared its intelligence extensively with EU partners. The prime minister also insisted the Snowden revelations would make the world more dangerous as they signalled "to people who mean to do us harm how to evade and avoid intelligence and surveillance and other techniques". </body>

      <title>Funds 'mismanaged' at free school</title>
      <description>Flagship free school Kings Science Academy in Bradford is accused of financial mismanagement in a government report.</description>

      <body>One of the country's flagship free schools has been accused of serious financial mismanagement. An Education Funding Agency (EFA) report reveals allegations of financial irregularities and even possible fraud at Kings Science Academy in Bradford. As a free school it is state funded but not under local authority control. In a statement to Newsnight the school admitted there were problems in the few months after the school was set up, but said those problems had been addressed. Kings Science Academy, which is a co-educational school for 11 to 18-year-olds, opened in September 2011 and was one of England's first free schools. Newsnight spoke to a former staff member and also the school's ex-finance director both of whom voiced concerns about the running of the school. It was set up by Bradford-born teacher Sajid Raza, also known as Sajid Hussain, who is now the school's headteacher. Mr Raza said he wanted to provide a first class education to some of the city's most deprived children. The school has been praised by Prime Minister David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove, both of whom have visited it. Alan Lewis, a successful businessman and the Conservative Party's vice-chairman, was a key benefactor and supporter. And the school is built on land owned by Mr Lewis and leased to the academy by his company at a cost of £296,000 a year for 20 years. A draft EFA report was leaked to the BBC's Newsnight programme, which is broadcasting an investigation into the school later on Friday, but the Department for Education (DfE) has now published a redacted final version of it on its website. In a statement attached to the redacted report the DfE said: "We found serious failings in financial management at the Kings Science Academy (KSA). We informed the police who decided no further action was necessary. "We required KSA to address these failings urgently. A plan is in place to recover funds and the school is undertaking its own investigation. Any necessary disciplinary action is a matter for the school." The DfE said that concerns about governance arrangements at the school had been flagged up to them by a whistle-blower in late 2012, and that they had examined the allegations on an already scheduled visit, arranged to look at the school's financial management. The findings of that visit combined with the school's own review of its accounting triggered a forensic investigation in early 2013, the DfE added. The school was paid a £182,933 grant when it opened in September 2011. The EFA investigation found that £59,560 of payments were not supported by any evidence of payments being made, and £10,800 of this was supported by fabricated invoices for rent. There was also a total of £26,775 which had been over-claimed against payments which had been made legitimately. And that therefore, there was a total of £86,335 which had not been used for its intended purpose. The DfE said that when the academy was spoken to about the discrepancies they were able to provide some evidence of legitimate payments which resulted in the total amount which could not be justified being reduced to £76,933. The DfE says there is a plan in place for the school to pay back that amount. The report also flagged up the fact that a number of Mr Raza's family members were hired to work at the school. His brother was on the board of governors, his sister was a senior teacher at the school, his wife also worked there and his father drove the school bus. Speaking on condition of anonymity a former staff member spoke to Newsnight about their time at the academy. "I think with the benefit of hindsight now looking back on it it's fair to say certainly the key decisions or the key power and authority was based around his family," they said. The EFA report does not say whether Mr Raza's family members were appointed through the usual processes or not. However, it did flag up that some staff were appointed without interviews. "We were informed that a small number of staff were employed by the academy without applying for posts, although they were interviewed by the governing board members to ensure their suitability," the report said. The school's former finance director Daud Khan also spoke to Newsnight. "Sajid would do a lot of things behind closed doors. He wouldn't get me involved or anybody else. And I don't know how much he was telling the governors and even if he was telling them the majority of them were all their friends anyway, so they would back him up," Mr Khan said. A statement issued on behalf of Mr Raza and the school said that the issues raised by Newsnight related to a period two years ago. "We acknowledge that there were poor governance issues during the start-up due to the pace of setting the new school up in two to three months," it said "These have since been addressed with the support of external auditors and accountants Deloittes and Crowe Clark Whitehill. All payments received from the DfE have been fully accounted for by the academy and any sums incorrectly claimed have been repaid." It added that the latest reviews by the local authority had been positive. A statement issued by Mr's Lewis' company said: "His contribution to the academy has been that of a benefactor. At no time has Mr Lewis had responsibility for the financial management of the academy." </body>

      <title>Man denies owning 3D printer gun</title>
      <description>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun says the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever".</description>

      <body>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun said the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever". It follows police raids in Greater Manchester on Thursday, in which officers seized computer equipment. The arrested man said the suspicious parts were simply parts for the 3D printer. Experts have also cast doubts on the claims, saying the parts were not sophisticated enough to make a gun. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Greater Manchester Police said the components had been sent to the National Ballistics Service for further examination. The results are expected in the next few days. The force said it "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts that could make a "viable" gun. US based printer maker, MakerBot Industries, which makes the components, said the company had examined the photographs. Jennifer Howard, the firm's director of PR, said: "We've seen the photographs and they definitely look like parts for the printer. "The first one looks like a pin that goes with an extruder upgrade - there is an upgrade kit that is available to make your printer work better. "The second looks like a filament spool, certainly that is what people who 3D print recognise it as." Brian Derby, professor of material science at Manchester University, said the printer was a "hobbyist's machine". He said: "It would make something that would look like a gun but it would not work as a gun." "You would have to buy an expensive machine for about £50,000 but you could get a real gun. "What is made is not likely to work. It is dangerous and likely to harm the person using it." The arrested man, who does not want to identified, was held following a police raid in Wythenshawe. "I have no idea why they think it is part of a gun," he said. "It's designed by the company that makes the printer to go in the printer to make it better." Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, who is a member of the national firearms group, said: "What I would say is that its actually incredibly difficult to create the whole weapon. "And even if you do create the weapon its still incredibly difficult to fire it because it tends to blow up in your face." He said officers were "absolutely legitimate to get a warrant from the magistrate go in and do the search that we did". A GMP spokesman earlier said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Asst Ch Con Heywood said: "We need to be absolutely clear that at that this stage, we cannot categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3D gun. "What we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine, viable firearm." "It is prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat." The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>Augusto Odone, who rejected medical opinion and created an oil to save the life of his son Lorenzo has died. The former World Bank economist died in Italy aged 80, said his family. Augusto Odone taught himself enough science to invent a treatment for his six-year-old son after he was diagnosed with a neurological disease and given two years to live. Lorenzo eventually died aged 30. The battle to help him was depicted in a 1992 Hollywood film, Lorenzo's Oil. Lorenzo Odone was diagnosed with adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD, a neurological disease that progressively destroys the brains of young boys. The disease leads to the build-up of dangerous "long-chain" fatty acids, and within a year children are paralysed, blind and unable to speak. Doctors predicted that Lorenzo would die in childhood. But Augusto Odone and his wife Michaela refused to accept the prognosis for their son, and put all their energies into trying to find a treatment. Despite having no formal scientific training, Augusto Odone studied medicine and biochemistry, and concocted a mixture of acids from olive and rapeseed oils. The Odones eventually persuaded an elderly British chemist, Don Suddaby, to distil the formula, which became known as Lorenzo's Oil. After testing it on a family member, Augusto Odone gave the oil to Lorenzo, with dramatic results: his long-chain fatty acids started to drop to normal levels. Its success in delaying the onset of symptoms in Lorenzo was demonstrated by the fact he lived to the age of 30, far beyond what doctors had predicted. Scientific studies have shown that the oil has most effect on children who have the ALD gene but have not yet displayed any of the symptoms. The story of Augusto and Michaela Odone was depicted in Lorenzo's Oil, which starred Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon as the parents. After the death of his wife in 2000, Augusto Odone returned from the United States to his native Piedmont region of Italy, to be near his surviving children. </body>

      <body>A monkey that escaped from Belfast zoo has been recaptured, after zoo staff shot it with a tranquilliser gun. The animal fell from a tree after it was sedated by zoo staff at Gideon's Green in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. A hydraulic lift, supplied by the fire service, was used to help zoo keepers reach the monkey in the trees. It was one of six lion-tailed macaques that escaped from the zoo on Monday. Five have now been recaptured but one monkey is still missing. Up to 12 zoo staff arrived in Gideon's Green after the monkey was spotted up a tree on Friday afternoon. A large crowd gathered to watch their attempts to capture the animal. The missing macaques had been spotted several times in the north Belfast and Newtownabbey areas over recent days. On Thursday, one of the monkeys was captured by zoo keepers in the grounds of Belfast Castle. Another escaped macaque scaled a "peace line" fence outside a primary school in Newtownabbey. It was spotted, perched on the peace line, during the school run on Thursday morning. Children at Hazelwood Integrated primary school, on the Whitewell Road, enticed the monkey down from the fence by offering it bananas. However, the animal took the bananas and escaped before zoo staff arrived. </body>

      <body>Troubled Sunderland may have been anything but infallible this season, but one man appears to be keeping the faith. Pope Francis has been given a personalised Black Cats shirt ahead of this weekend's derby clash with arch-rivals Newcastle United. The shirt was presented to him by Father Marc Lyden-Smith, who is Sunderland Football Club's chaplain. He is in Rome with Bishop Seamus Cunningham and a group of pilgrims. Fr Lyden-Smith said: "We have 60 pilgrims from the North East in Rome at the moment visiting churches and shrines. As part of the pilgrimage we took part in the papal audience on Wednesday morning. "As chaplain of Sunderland Football Club, they asked if I could present him with a shirt that had his name on the back - Papa Francesco. "It was a bit of a miracle really. There were 120,000 people gathered in the square. We managed to get tickets up at the front and the pope was guided towards us. "Some people from the North East managed to shake his hand and then I asked if he would accept the shirt and he took it and waved it in the air to cheers." Asked if the pope would be supporting the team against fierce rivals Newcastle United at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Sunday, he said: "He is very diplomatic and wouldn't say that. "He's a keen football fan - he was a season ticket holder before he was elected as pope." </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24672344</url>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and rival G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. For the moment, Mr Hyman's position will be taken over by Ed Casey, who runs the US division, while the company looks for an external full-time replacement. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan called for ministers to provide assurances that no confidentiality deals or "other arrangements that avoided justice" were being done. Mr Khan also asked ministers to "publish immediately the PriceWaterhouseCooper report into the activities of G4S and Serco." Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was "surprised" by the resignation of Mr Hyman, because he "always maintained there is nothing untoward with the contracts Serco holds with the government". He said Mr Hyman maintained the position "even after the company was referred by Secretary of State for Justice to the SFO". Shares in Serco, which has in excess of 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, rose after the news. It has lost more than 10% of its value since May - when the government first voiced its concerns over the tagging contract. "They were always going to have to make some sort of major change," Cantor analyst Sam Thomas said. "This is about transforming their recently damaged reputation and I think in appointing an external new chief executive they are hoping to draw a line under the previous issues." Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The UK chief executive at G4S, Richard Morris, also stepped down on Thursday. The latest development in the scandal is likely to fuel debate over the value to the government of outsourcing public services to private companies, after G4S failed to provide enough security staff for the 2012 Olympics. </body>

      <body>A spat between two former Conservative leaders continues after Iain Duncan Smith mocked Sir John Major's support for a "cones hotline" in the 1990s. Relations between the two men have been cool ever since Mr Duncan Smith led opposition to Sir John over the Maastricht Treaty on EU integration. On Tuesday, Sir John took a swipe at Mr Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, saying his "genius was unproven". Now Mr Duncan Smith has hit back in an interview in the Evening Standard. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mr Duncan Smith told the newspaper. "Well, as I say, I never really get too fussed about what people think about their own intellects. "I'm always happy to be in awe of someone whose own intellect delivered us the cones hotline, I must say." The cones hotline - a telephone number for motorists to ring if they were irritated by unattended road works - was one of the most mocked policies of the Major government. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith insisted to the BBC it was a throw away line and meant as a joke. There has been little love lost between the two men since, as a backbencher in the early 1990s, Mr Duncan Smith was one of a group of rebels who fought a long parliamentary campaign against the Major government's decision to sign up to the Maastricht Treaty - regarded as a landmark moment in European integration. The battles, which resulted in the Major government facing a confidence vote in the House of Commons, undermined Sir John's authority and led to the prime minister calling his opponents "bastards". He repeated the phrase in a speech to an audience of political journalists on Tuesday, saying his use of the word was "unacceptable" but "his only excuse was that it was true". In the speech, Sir John also questioned the likely outcome of Mr Duncan Smith's sweeping programme of welfare changes. "Iain Duncan Smith is trying to reform benefits," he said. "I truly wish him well. But it is enormously complicated and unless he is very lucky, which he may not be, or a genius, which the last time I looked was unproven, he may get some of it wrong." Mr Duncan Smith's Universal Credit is seen as one of the most ambitious, and potentially risky, policies the coalition has embarked upon. Chancellor George Osborne has denied reports in a recent book by the journalist Matthew D'Ancona that he had questioned whether Mr Duncan Smith had the intelligence to run a major department like work and pensions. Referring to the matter recently at the Tory conference, Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that both Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher had had their intellect questioned but had proved their doubters wrong. And Mr Duncan Smith told the Evening Standard on Friday: "I never make any claims for myself, I just say I think we should all look at each other and be a little more pleasant." </body>

      <description>Campaigners write to David Cameron demanding action on the "national crisis" of cold homes, as people are advised to keep houses well heated.</description>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <body>A shake-up of English literature at A-level will result in teenagers studying a minimum of eight texts in depth, says a consultation paper. History A-level students will study a "chronological range" of at least 200 years, while science A-levels will include more maths. The changes, put forward by exam boards with advice from academics, flesh out government plans for A-level reforms. A-levels will depend on final "linear" exams after two years study from 2015. The changes have proved controversial and include the "decoupling" of AS-levels from A-levels to become a stand-alone qualification. The consultation document outlines revisions to 14 A-level subjects: art and design, biology, business studies, chemistry, computing, economics, English language, English literature, English language and literature, geography, history, physics, psychology and sociology. It follows a review of the content of A-levels earlier this year chaired by Prof Mark E Smith, vice-chancellor of Lancaster University, with input from the exam boards. The consultation translates the review's recommendations into proposals for each subject. Maths and language A-levels are being considered separately and will not be taught until 2016. In English literature, the eight texts to be studied in depth must include at least three works from before 1900 including a Shakespeare play, as well a work from after 2000. Students currently have to study 12 texts - six at AS-level and a further six for the full A-level. The new exam will also include an "unseen text". "To prepare for examinations with unseen texts, students will need to read widely, broadening their knowledge and their critical and comparative understanding of literature", says the consultation paper. English language A-level students will have to study six texts, including "non-literary" work such as essays or journalism. The new history A-level will no longer require students to study more than one period. Instead sixth-formers will be asked to study topics from a chronological range of at least 200 years. "This will enable A-level students to develop an understanding of historical events in the context of longer term and broader chronological changes," says the document. Business studies and computing A-levels will be renamed business and computer science. Students taking economics, computer science, biology, chemistry, physics and psychology A-levels, will have to use more maths. In art and design, there will be "a new emphasis on drawing". Professor Smith said: "The government has made clear that higher education should have a greater role in reforming A-levels. "I fully support an approach where universities play a key role, as we see first hand what A-level students have learned and the skills they have acquired. "I believe the proposals set out here update, modernise and improve A-level content." A separate consultation on A-level coursework and on the new AS-levels for the same 14 subjects was also launched on Friday by the exams regulator, Ofqual. This looks at "subject by subject arrangements that put in place a better balance between exam and non-exam assessment or coursework". The changes include the reintroduction of non-exam assessment of fieldwork in geography which will count for 20% of the final grade. In biology, chemistry and physics, practical skills will be assessed but the marks will be reported separately and will not count towards students' grades. AS-levels will be designed so that they can be taught alongside A-levels. Ofqual says: "In other words the content of an AS will be a sub-set of the content for the corresponding A-level." </body>

      <body>The adult-themed crime game, Grand Theft Auto 5, has won the top prize at the Golden Joystick awards. Rockstar's controversial game - where players commit crime in the fictional city of Los Santos - was presented with the Game of the Year gong at a ceremony in central London. Sony's The Last of Us also scooped two awards. Ken Levine - the man behind Bioshock and System Shock 2 - was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. The Golden Joysticks are the largest publicly-voted video game awards in the world, with this year more than 10 million people casting a vote. The Lifetime Achievement is a new addition to the ceremony. Mr Levine has been a high profile figure in the industry ever since he worked with designer Doug Church, on the first-person shooter, Thief: The Dark Project, credited with being one of the first titles to introduce the concept of stealth into video games. "The great thing about the still-maturing nature of video games is you get to be inspired by the work of novices and veterans alike," he said. "We're all figuring out day by day exactly what the medium is capable of." Now in its 31st year, the awards were first given out back in 1983, with the first Game of the Year award going to Jet Pac on the ZX Spectrum. Andy Robinson, editor of Computer and Videogames, said that three decades on, the awards still "represent the voice of gamers worldwide". "We've revamped the categories to reflect the diversity of modern gaming and also added the inaugural Lifetime Achievement award, which has made this year's ceremony the most thrilling for us yet," he said. The Golden Joysticks are not the only big awards for the video games industry. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts hands out its Video Game Baftas in the spring each year, although the majority of their awards are selected by a panel of experts, rather than a public vote. Grand Theft Auto 5, released last month, quickly became the fastest selling entertainment product ever, taking just three days to generate $1bn (£620m) in revenue. </body>

      <title>Dino impact 'also decimated bees'</title>

      <body>Scientists say there was a widespread extinction of bees 66 million years ago, at the same time as the event that killed off the dinosaurs. The demise of the dinosaurs was almost certainly the result of an asteroid or comet hitting Earth. But the extinction event was selective, affecting some groups more than others. Writing in Plos One journal, the team used fossils and DNA analysis to show that one bee group suffered a serious decline at the time of this collision. The researchers chose to study bees within the subfamily known as Xylocopinae - which included the carpenter bees. This was because the evolutionary history of this group could be traced back to the Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs still walked the Earth. Previous studies had suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event 66 million years ago. And it had long been assumed that the bees that depended upon these plants would have met the same fate. Yet, unlike the dinosaurs, "there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees," said the paper's lead author Sandra Rehan, a biologist at the University of New Hampshire in Dunham, US. This has made the confirmation of such an extinction difficult. However, the researchers were able to use an extinct group of Xylocopinae as a calibration point for timing the dispersal of these bees. They were also able to study flower fossils that had evolved traits that allowed them to be pollinated by bee relatives of the Xylocopinae. "The data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time," said Dr Rehan. "And it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct." The findings of this study could have implications for today's concern about the loss in diversity of bees, a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity. "Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today," Dr Rehan explained. </body>

      <body>It is a year to the day since the news that ash dieback had been found in Britain's native woodland was officially confirmed. The announcement sparked a deal of hand wringing and some dire predictions - it would be Armageddon in the countryside, as the disease that had decimated European forests let rip in this green and pleasant land. It was even claimed that a third of Britain's trees might be lost in little more than a generation.

      <body>Actors David Tennant and Olivia Colman have helped ITV's Broadchurch win four prizes - dubbed the Daggers - at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards. The pair picked up the best actor and actress awards for their roles in the drama, with co-star Andrew Buchan named best supporting actor. Broadchurch also won the TV prize, with Bond movie Skyfall named best film. Martina Cole and Wilbur Smith were also inducted into the Crime Writers' Association Hall of Fame at the event. The pair were honoured in recognition of their contributions to the genre. The awards - which marked the culmination of ITV3's Crime Thriller Book Club - included a new award for the club's best read, which went to Malcolm MacKay for The Necessary Death Of Lewis Winter. After beating books by Linwood Barclay, Megan Abbott, Christopher Fowler, Diana Bretherick and Andrew Taylor, the author said it was "a huge honour and thrill to win". Mick Herron picked up the coveted Gold Dagger award for best crime novel of the year for Dead Lions. "My shelves are crammed with Gold Dagger-winning novels of the past - The Mermaids Singing, Black and Blue, Bones and Silence. I can't quite believe I get to put my own book next to them," he said. The best new crime writer prize went to Derek B Miller for his debut novel Norwegian By Night Roger, while Roger Hobbs's Ghostman was named best thriller of the year. Other awards went to Amelia Bullmore, who won best supporting actress for her role in ITV's Scott and Bailey, while Danish series The Killing III won the best international TV prize.

      <title>IVF and the marketing of hope</title>
      <description>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine.</description>

      <body>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Modern medicine can achieve extraordinary feats in repairing and protecting the human body, from hip replacements to life-extending cancer treatments. But for most of us, I think, there are two areas of medical intervention that have a very special status and deserve the closest ethical attention: birth and death, the creation of life and its termination. Just such close scrutiny was given to an amazing breakthrough in the treatment of infertility - the birth of the first "test tube baby", Louise Brown, in Oldham in 1978. As further successful IVF births followed, it was quickly decided by the British government that some sort of ethical and legal oversight was needed. Treating infertility by combining egg and sperm outside the womb, and then replacing the resulting embryo in the mother, was an established clinical reality. The question was, is it ethically acceptable to carry out the procedure, and what limitations and controls should be placed upon it to satisfy public concern? In summer 1984, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology - the Warnock Report - was published. The task of the committee had been "to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of recent, and potential developments in the field of human assisted reproduction". The report highlighted the "special status" of the human embryo, and proposed the establishment of a regulator. The legislation derived from the report continues to govern In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) in the UK 30 years later under that regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA. PDF download The Warnock Report[770KB] Dame Mary Warnock - now Baroness Warnock - turned out to be the ideal person to steer the public moral debate on IVF. As commentator Andrew Brown wrote in 2003: "Her distrust of grand schemes and theories [made] her much in demand as a kind of philosophical plumber to the establishment - whenever some tricky problem arose, she could be trusted to get things flowing again." Born into an old-fashioned, well-to-do family, Warnock studied Classics at Oxford, and became a lecturer in philosophy at St Hugh's College in 1949. Turning her attention to schooling after the birth of her five children, she became head of Oxford High School in 1966, and spent six years championing girls' secondary education. In the 1970s, she moved into public life and began to demonstrate her considerable skills as a committee chair capable of dealing with tricky political and ethical issues. She chaired a Home Office Commission of Inquiry into the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and a government commission on the education of children with special needs. Her clear-headedness and keen intellect helped dissect the issue and structure the agenda in whatever controversial arena she engaged in. These talents were complemented by her administrative skill, and her shrewd grasp of politics. She knew which recommendations would work administratively while being politically workable too. Even she probably did not anticipate the furore the Warnock Report would cause. There was opposition from religious figures, politicians and the general public to the very practice of this way of creating new life. It is a real tribute to the care with which the report was written that eventually legislation to regulate IVF went on to the statute book, and the regulatory body to oversee it - the HFEA - was set up. "Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Warnock committee is that it managed to get an ethical consensus that people understood as well as shared," observed a former HFEA chair. The results of Warnock's astuteness are to be seen in the formal structure of the HFEA as established in 1990. It must have expert medical and scientific representation, she advised, but it ought to be led by a lay chair - someone with strong ethical beliefs, but outside the IVF sector. Each of its decision-making committees should also have a lay majority. I have served as chair of the HFEA for the past six years. Next month will be my last authority meeting. So it seems an appropriate moment to reflect on my experience in that role. I have seen at first hand how the regulation of IVF uses the most elegant features of UK regulatory legislation to best advantage. Legislation is passed which lays down a broad-brush picture of a sensitive area's activities and how they need to be monitored. Then the specialist regulator monitors those activities on a day-to-day basis - in the case of IVF, recording the details of every one of the 60,000 cycles carried out in a calendar year, inspecting and licensing clinics in both the NHS and the private sector and approving research involving embryos. In a fast-changing field, decisions on difficult or anomalous cases are taken on an individual basis, with the best available expert advice, and policy is developed to cover new techniques and circumstances as they emerge. The most important consequence of the close scrutiny the HFEA gives is that public confidence is robustly maintained, even as the possibilities given to those unable to have children naturally, but desperate to do so, expand at a giddying speed. Baroness Warnock will have been barely aware in the 1980s of clinical possibilities which now enable parents who carry a rare genetic defect to have their embryos screened, and an undamaged one selected, so that the baby will not die in infancy. She could not have imagined the technique of mitochondrial replacement - removing the nucleus from an egg with mitochondrial abnormalities, and placing it in a donor egg. Over the past two years, the HFEA has carried out a consultation process with clinicians, scientists and the public in order to advise the present government on whether this technique - which has up to now only been allowed in the research laboratory - should be introduced into clinical practice. Perhaps surprisingly, the public supported the new technique, if it could prevent serious illness. They had little objection to its being approved for clinical use, as long as it was scrupulously overseen by an appropriate regulatory body. Like any outgoing chair, there are, of course things I regret not having achieved. My personal mission when I took up the post was, inevitably given my interests, public engagement - disseminating as widely as possible both the benefits and disadvantages of all aspects of assisted reproduction. This proved to be unexpectedly difficult to do. There is an extraordinarily high level of coverage of any story involving IVF in the media - celebrity births, tales of miracle babies after years of trying, and above all, breakthroughs in clinical practice which may bring hope to thousands wishing for their own child. This is a sector that trades in hope, and the papers and women's magazines are full of encouragement. Yet the success rates for IVF remain discouragingly low. The last figures we have show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients will emerge with a baby (the figures are somewhat higher for women under 35). That leaves two thirds of would-be mothers and fathers with the heartbreak of "failure". And the costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics, but the HFEA has no control over the prices charged. A couple - and nowadays that means same-sex couples as well as traditional partnerships - is likely to have spent something of the order of £15,000 for the three cycles it is likely to have taken should they be fortunate enough to become pregnant. I would have loved to have been able to have spoken more often and more publicly, with more words of caution for those proposing to undertake IVF, or postponing their family because IVF seems a reliable option should natural conception fail. Columnist Zoe Williams wrote a telling piece about the heartache of unsuccessful treatment last month, headlined Where's all the grief going? But newspapers today want banner headlines and excitement. Public information is nowhere on their agenda. Try as I might, I have not been able to talk at length to all those families out there who are about to enter the world of IVF, or who are undergoing treatment and being persuaded to try again and again when it fails, or who are entering their 40s and hoping IVF will allow them to start a late family. The world of IVF is a market, a market in hope. Those who enter it deserve to be fully informed of its potential to deliver grief and a sense of failure, as well as success.

      <body>Welcome to The Loop, the Magazine's letters column, including the best of your thoughts from Twitter and Facebook. Readers will, we hope, excuse confusion on our part this week when we saw this tweet from Noel Lynch. He wrote: "A lion tamer friend of mine once told me that lion urine works very well." But what was he referring to? Something to do with how to deter foxes from your garden, perhaps? The Magazine spoke to a fox expert who specialises in removing them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. The trick is to disturb the wily creatures' normal behaviour. The piece singularly failed to discuss how one might humanely collect lion urine, however. So we thought perhaps the tip was something about how to deal with problematic housemates, as the Magazine had also noted that the high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. Avoiding picking a duff housemate can be tricky, but there could be a few signs to look out for. @Philly_Spurr: "If they come to view a flat with their annoying partner and casually enquire about a double bed, its a no go!" Housemates' partners can be trouble makers, as John Morris pointed out: "I shared a house with two girls in Shooters Hill in the 1970s. One day I came home and one of the girl's boyfriends had adorned the living room and hall with posters for the Socialist Workers' Party. I left." Amy Wilson for Leamington Spa is having a much more positive experience, though. "I currently live in a house share with 20 other people. Our little community comprises international students, young professionals and the odd nutter. The biggest thing I have learnt is compromise. The kitchens may not always be clean and food goes missing, but the experience of living with so many different people and cultures makes up for it tenfold. I have learnt so much from the people I live with I can forgive the odd mouldy cup!" After pondering Noel's tweet at length, we thought it might be referring to the story about exotic pastries - a new generation of French pastry chefs are reinventing their craft with audacious creations. Anyone for a caramel popcorn, pistachio orange or pecan eclair, or an olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water? Perhaps these new flavours are crying out for a secret ingredient. Ingredients - particularly bitter ones - are popular with drinks such as the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". The taste of Negronis was the subject of a conversation by readers on Facebook. Could someone please help Sanjeev Prakash out? "Alright, I 'fess: I like Campari as an aperitif, but what the blazes is a Negroni..? Gin +______?" Jane Shepherd, perhaps, who loves Negronis. "When I was 23 I came back from an Italian break with a bottle of Campari, a drink I'd enjoyed in Rome and Sorrento. Instead of sipping it sedately and making it last, I made a big bucket of Negroni (not so easy on the gin) with my flatmates and felt no pain whatsoever." One thing we know a Negroni is not made from is lion urine. C'mon Noel Lynch, help us out here. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Garth Crooks has criticised Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho for their response to the Yaya Toure racism row. Arsenal manager Wenger wants to wait for "more proof" that Manchester City midfielder Toure was racially abused by CSKA Moscow fans on Wednesday. And Chelsea boss Mourinho has played down talk of black players boycotting the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Crooks, trustee of anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out, said he was "disappointed" by their comments. "How many more times are black players going to have to suffer this nonsense in order to play football," said BBC football expert Crooks, who played for Stoke and Tottenham. "For Wenger to ask for further evidence is extraordinary given the fact that Yaya heard the evidence reported and his club have backed their captain on the night. "I am equally disappointed with Jose Mourinho's comments, about how he feels that black players should go into a hostile racial environment in order to show them how good they are. "Now there is a man who has never had to suffer racial abuse. "I really expected modern managers such as Wenger and Mourinho to support Toure and other Premier League players." "If that is the best they can say on this issue, I suggest they stick to what they know." Toure claimed he was racially abused in Moscow and suggested African players might boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Asked on Friday if a boycott was still a possibility, the Ivory Coast player told BBC Afrique: "We're not here yet." He added: "Let's leave Fifa and Uefa to do their work." Mourinho insists boycotting the 2018 World Cup is not the way to combat racism in football and urged players not to punish "billions" for the "disgraceful behaviour" of thousands. "The history of football was made equally by many races," he said. "And the black players have a fantastic contribution of what football is. "You go to the World Cup, the World Cup is the biggest expression of national team competitions - races, people from different parts of the globe, people from every continent. And the black players are very, very important for that. "Who is more important, the billions of people in love with the game around the world? Or a few thousand that go to football stadiums and have disgraceful behaviour in relation to black players. "If I was a black player I would say the other billions are much more important, so let's fight the thousands, but let's give to the billions what the billions want. And the billions want the best football and the best football without black players is not the best football, for sure." Wenger added that Uefa must complete its investigation before there is any more talk of a boycott. "I don't know what really happened there, but you cannot tolerate racism of any kind and you have to fight against it. How do you do that?" he said. "Honestly I believe Uefa is taking action in the right way and to go as extreme as a boycott, it's a bit early to do that because it's not proven what happened. I believe that Russia itself has to fight against that and of course you want everybody to be active on that." Toure spoke to referee Ovidiu Hategan during the 2-1 win over CSKA to complain about the behaviour of the home fans, although the Russian club have denied any racist abuse took place. The Romanian official chose to do nothing at the time, but Uefa, which governs European football, has since opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans". </body>

      <body>South Africa have been penalised five runs for ball tampering during the third day of the second Test against Pakistan in Dubai. Replays showed Faf du Plessis rubbing the ball over a zip on his trousers. After talking to Proteas captain Graeme Smith during Pakistan's second innings, umpire Ian Gould awarded the additional runs to Pakistan. But South Africa vice-captain AB de Villiers said: "We are not a team that scratches the ball." The decision meant the umpires had decided the ball's condition had been changed contrary to the game's rules. It is expected the umpires will lay a charge against Du Plessis to match referee David Boon after the day's play, with an immediate hearing to follow. "We don't cheat, it is as simple as that," De Villiers continued. "I know Faf du Plessis very well, he's the last player on the field who will try something like that. "It is part of his responsibility to shine the ball and get it to swing. It's not an easy job and I thought he did it very well." Gould and fellow umpire Rod Tucker, who also ordered the ball to be changed, took the unusual action at the start of the evening session in Dubai, where South Africa are on the verge of completing a comfortable victory. After bowling Pakistan out for 99 in their first innings, Smith hit 234 and AB de Villiers 164 as South Africa made 517 in reply. Pakistan were 132-4 at the close on day three, needing a further 286 to avoid an innings defeat. "As per 42.1 of the ICC playing conditions, the umpires replaced the ball and fined the South Africa team five penalty runs for ball tampering," an ICC spokesperson confirmed. The last time a five-run penalty was issued for ball tampering was during the 2006 Oval Test between England and Pakistan, when the tourists were adjudged the guilty party. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq reacted angrily and decided not to continue the Test in protest. Australian umpire Darrell Hair duly awarded the game to England - the only forfeited match in Test history. This month, the ICC amended its laws regarding the condition of balls, saying "if a player responsible can be identified" the ball will be changed, a five-run penalty will be awarded and the player responsible will be reported. Altering the condition of the ball is a level two offence under the ICC's code of conduct, which carries a penalty of 50-100% of their match fee and/or suspension from one Test or two one-day internationals for a first offence. </body>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel would not be "afraid" of taking on one of Formula 1's other leading names as his team-mate but insists he has nothing to prove. The German can clinch a fourth world title in India on Sunday but has to face claims his remarkable success is largely down to having the best car. Red Bull resisted opportunities in the last 18 months to sign Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. "One day maybe I will race alongside Kimi or Fernando," Vettel said. "It depends how long we stick around. But I am not afraid of that because you want to beat the guys on the track and you want to find out who is the best." Vettel, who has won the last five races in a row, needs only a fifth place in the Indian Grand Prix to be absolutely sure of the title. Only Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is mathematically able to beat him, but is 90 points behind with only 100 still available. The Spaniard needs to out-score Vettel by 16 points on Sunday to prolong the championship to the next race in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Vettel, who was talking in a BBC Sport interview to be broadcast ahead of the race on Sunday, rejected a suggestion that he needs to take on Alonso, Hamilton or Raikkonen in another car to prove his greatness to any doubters. "You can think about this a lot," he said. "I think we don't have to prove anything. I think we have proven enough. "We have had three fantastic years. This year has been fantastic. I believe things happen for a reason. "For sure you need the right package. We had a very strong package the last couple of years. I believe we had a very strong package in 2009, when we finished second in the championship. "With the experience I have today maybe 2009 would have been different. At the time I did the best I could. I did mistakes, I still do now, but the most important thing is I learn from them. "You can find lots of difficulties I had to face. [Last year] we got sent to the back of the grid in Abu Dhabi and had to come back, we had a nightmare race in Brazil. "We managed to come back [and seal the championship]. It was a bit tight in some places, a bit lucky. We worked very hard for what we have achieved basically, as a team. "For sure some people will think you have to do this and that. The most important is to prove something to yourself." Asked how he felt he compared as a driver to Hamilton and Alonso, Vettel said: "It's difficult because I don't know what they do. I can see what they do on the track. I don't know how much time they spend setting up the car, how much they care. "I'm sure we all care because no-one wants to drive a car that is set up badly, but for sure some people invest more time and some less. I don't think there is a right and wrong, it is what you feel happy with."

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara cut short his news conference ahead of their World Cup opener against Australia. McNamara walked out after six minutes as he was questioned on his selection decisions. Second row forward Gareth Hock was removed from the squad after a breach of discipline following England's 15-14 defeat by Italy in a warm-up game. Prop James Graham has not been selected for Saturday's opener with the Kangaroos at the Millennium Stadium. Hock told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. McNamara refused to discuss the disciplinary issues during the media conference and no players were made available to speak. The England coach was questioned about absence of Graham from his 19-man squad, amid speculation that the former St Helens forward had been involved in the post-Italy game incident. "There are seven very good players not playing this week," McNamara said. "I'm certainly not going to talk about any individuals among those seven. "They are all great players, great people and I'm sure they'll get a part to play during the rest of the tournament." McNamara denied it had been a tough week for him ahead of the opener with Australia and has faith in his squad despite disciplinary issues. "It's been a week as a coach, simple as that, preparing a team getting ready to face Australia and a team that under-performed last week against Italy," he said. "That's been the nuts and the bolts of the job this week. "I think the world of that squad, every single one of them and they will all play a part during this World Cup." McNamara became frustrated as he was questioned on disciplinary issues and said: "I'm not going to answer any more questions on it. If you want to continue asking the questions, then we'll wrap up now." McNamara briefly went on to talk about the match against Australia but ended the session abruptly when asked about Hock. Australia coach Tim Sheens denied he was pleased to see England's troubled build-up to Saturday's game in Cardiff. "I made the comment earlier in the week that an embarrassed side is a dangerous side," he said. "Anyone involved in sport understands that when things go wrong, it can have the exact reverse effect." </body>

      <title>Fifa heading into choppy World Cup waters</title>
      <description>Fifa faces difficult years ahead with World Cups in Brazil, Russia and Qatar, says sports editor David Bond</description>

      <body>It is almost three years now since Fifa awarded the 2018 and 2022 World Cups to Russia and Qatar respectively. In that time, world football's governing body has had to withstand numerous allegations of corruption surrounding the joint vote that decided the hosts of both tournaments. To add to the discontent, there has also been a purge of Fifa's executive committee, with eight members either suspended or forced to resign following claims of misconduct. Fifa president Sepp Blatter,  in England for the Football Association's 150th anniversary gala dinner on Saturday, will tell you that his beleaguered organisation is moving in the right direction. Or, to borrow one of his favourite analogies, he is steering the ship towards calmer seas. But, in many ways, the waters ahead look even choppier. By choosing Russia and Qatar to follow next year's World Cup in Brazil, Fifa has guaranteed itself another decade of problems and negative headlines. Fifa sources will tell you privately that for all the bad publicity around the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, there are far more concerns within the governing body about the tournament in Brazil. Never mind the street protests and social unrest, which are almost certain to be an issue next year, there are still question marks over transport, organisation and infrastructure in the South American country. Former England coach Fabio Capello, now in charge of the Russia national team, told reporters recently that he was worried about Brazil's creaking transport system and the demands of playing games in different parts of such a vast country, where temperatures and conditions vary greatly. That is not to say that Qatar is without its own problems. Fifa may have parked any decision on moving the 2022 World Cup from the stifling heat of a Qatari summer to the cooler temperatures of spring or winter, but the Gulf state's treatment of migrant workers following a Guardian investigation alleging slave labour is still to be addressed. No doubt that topic will be on the agenda next month, when Blatter heads a Fifa delegation that will meet Qatar's new ruler, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani. As for Russia, it has received relatively little attention so far. All that has changed after Yaya Toure raised the possibility of a boycott of the 2018 World Cup after claiming he was racially abused during Manchester City's Champions League game against CSKA Moscow this week. While such incidents are sadly not new, it is the first time this issue has been so prominently linked to the World Cup. The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi are already facing the prospect of widespread protests aimed at Russia's new anti-gay legislation. But racism and attitudes towards homosexuality in Russia are just two examples of a deeper concern in the west about Vladimir Putin's government. Once the Sochi Games are out the way, Russia will find itself under even greater international scrutiny in the run-up to the 2018 World Cup. As emerging economies like China and Brazil become more and more powerful, so sports bodies have been trying to use their premium events to break into new territories and markets. Brazil, Russia and Qatar reflect that ambitious shift. But, by choosing these countries as hosts for the World Cup, Fifa has ensured it will be fighting major battles on three fronts. </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of murdering his business partner and throwing her down a well shaft in an attempt to gain a £1m inheritance. A jury at Reading Crown Court found Christopher Symons, 63, of Cambridge Street, Aylesbury, had killed Patricia Goodband, 76, in December. Her body was found concealed in the well in the grounds of her home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in January. Symons, who had denied murder, will be sentenced on Monday. The court earlier heard allegations that Symons "used" his sister Kathleen Adams and his lover Jennifer Creasey to hide his crime. Ms Adams, 74, of Aylesbury Road, Princes Risborough, was found not guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice. Creasey, 73, of Hale Road, Benson, Oxfordshire, was found guilty of one of two counts of the same charge. Symons' friend Robert Taft, 59, of Kings Close, Westcott, Aylesbury, had previously admitted perverting the course of justice and possession of ammunition without a certificate. Taft and Creasey will also be sentenced on Monday. Ms Goodband, who was last seen on 17 December, was reported missing by her daughter on 9 January. Her body was found on 21 January. During Symons' trial, the court heard Ms Goodband had been friends with him for more than 30 years and had run a road haulage and agricultural business with him from her home in Woodham. The prosecution said he killed her on 22 December in a "cold blooded, planned murder for financial gain", and his "motive was clear". A post-mortem examination found she died from head injuries. The defence had said much of the evidence against Mr Symons was "circumstantial and incomplete". Symons told police he dropped Mrs Goodband off at Milton Keynes station so she could go away over Christmas. His defence admitted this was untrue, but said Mr Symons was a man who lived a life of pretence and the fact he had lied did not mean he was guilty of murder. Det Supt Chris Ward from Thames Valley Police said Symons' actions were "pre-meditated and motivated purely by greed". "In order to inherit her property and share of their business, [he] devised a cruel and calculated plan to murder Patricia and make it appear as if she vanished without a trace," he said. "This has been a complex inquiry in which we have had to unpick all of Symons' lies in order to uncover the truth." </body>

      <title>Teenager sentenced for acid attack</title>
      <description>A 16-year-old boy is sentenced to eight years for an acid attack on a woman in Romford, east London.</description>

      <body>A 16-year-old boy has been sentenced to eight years and three months for an acid attack on a woman in east London. Tara Quigley, 28, suffered injuries to her face and upper body when acid was thrown at her as she answered the door at her home in Romford on 30 April. Liam Robert Sibbons pleaded guilty to a charge of throwing corrosive fluid on a person with intent to do grievous bodily harm (GBH). Sibbons will serve six years and three months in custody. He will be released on licence for the remainder of his sentence. The teenager can now be named after Judge David Radford lifted a reporting restriction. Prosecutor Martin Whitehouse told Snaresbrook Crown Court: "This was a horrific attack, involving a degree of brutality and callousness rarely encountered. "Almost, one might say, beyond comprehension." Miss Quigley, who did not know the teenager, has been left permanently scarred and will need regular treatment over the next four years. She suffered burns to 7% of her body, including her right arm, forearm, shoulder, chest, neck and face. The court heard that most of the burns went almost all the way through her skin and Miss Quigley has had two skin grafts which have only been 85% successful. In a victim impact statement, Miss Quigley, who was in court, said: "The attack has left me feeling as though my life has been blown apart." She added she was in constant pain and did not feel safe returning to her home. "I will have to live with this attack and the scars it has left me with for the rest of my life and nothing I can say or do will change that," she said. "I truly hope that the man responsible knows just what he has done and the grief and anguish he has caused to me and my entire family." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley had been at home when she saw someone approaching the house. When she opened the door she was asked by the person if she was called Michelle. She replied no and the person walked off, however 10 minutes later there was a loud knock on the door. The prosecutor said: "Miss Quigley opened the front door and saw the same man. He was holding onto a white bottle with both hands. "He then pointed the bottle at Miss Quigley and squeezed." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley felt an almost immediate burning sensation when the liquid came into contact with her skin. The court heard she shut the door and began to scream, and then ran into the kitchen and started splashing water on her face. An ambulance was called and Miss Quigley was taken to hospital for treatment. Sibbons received an acid burn to the left side of his chest during the attack. He had four previous convictions and was on bail at the time of the incident. Judge Radford said Sibbons had refused to explain why he carried out the attack. The judge said: "It was, in my judgment, a truly wicked offence, which clearly was premeditated." He added that the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity and a large amount of money had been found after the teenager was arrested. "Whether this was because you were being paid to commit this offence and there was some kind of mistake about the identity of the victim is a matter for speculation in the absence of candour and honesty on your part," the judge said. </body>

      <body>Scottish councils have imposed a pay deal on their staff after almost a year of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. Council staff other than teachers will get a 1% rise backdated to April of this year - and a further 1% rise next April. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla. Cosla said it could not allow the "dragging of feet" by the Unison union to continue. "This cannot continue any longer - our employees deserve their pay rise now," said Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry. "We have been in negotiations with the Scottish Joint Council trade unions for almost a full year after making an initial offer in November 2012. "The unions remain divided and the time has come to apply the deal." Mr Hendry added: "I am particularly pleased with the ground-breaking award of a living wage of £7.50 per hour in 2013/14, which will deliver real benefits for employees at the lower end of the pay scale, and an agreement to match the recommended figure due next month from the Living Wage Foundation for 2014/15, which will see a further living wage increase for the lowest paid." The pay deal does not apply to teachers. Earlier this week the largest teachers' union, the EIS, rejected changes to their terms and conditions of employment. The pay deal was conditional on accepting these changes. Mr Hendry continued: "It is deeply frustrating for me that I am not in a position to announce a pay increase at this time for our teaching workforce. "The decision by the EIS not to agree a deal has resulted in what we believe is an unnecessary delay. "Talks will continue in November which we hope will also bring this matter to a conclusion." </body>

      <title>Four jailed over weapons stash</title>
      <description>Four men are jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station.</description>

      <body>Four men have been jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station. Serving soldier William Dempsey left bags of weapons at Carlisle station after getting off a train to Glasgow. He collected them from James Ashdown in Kent. They were destined for Barry Kelly and Craig Colquhoun in Scotland. Dempsey and Ashdown were each jailed for eight years. Kelly was given nine years and Colquhoun seven years. Dempsey and Ashdown had previously admitted conspiracy to buy or sell illegal firearms. Kelly and Darvel were found guilty by a jury of the same offences earlier this month. Liverpool Crown Court heard how Dempsey, 29, from Paisley, left two Army camouflage bags containing the Uzi sub-machine gun, silencer, a handgun and a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun with two cleaners at the station. He asked them to look after the bags for him as he thought he was being followed. The court heard that the mortarman with the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, was dressed in desert combat uniform and had been exhibiting "somewhat bizarre behaviour". He told staff there were snipers at the station. He had collected the firearms from his friend Ashdown, 32, in Canterbury, where Dempsey's barracks were. The court heard how the bags, found on 17 August last year, also contained Dempsey's identification papers and 194 rounds of ammunition which had his name embroidered on them. They were destined for Kelly, 34, from Darvel, Ayrshire, and Colquhoun, 28, from Barrhead. A search at Dempsey's barracks uncovered a handgun-shaped crossbow, several metal tipped arrows and large military batteries. The battalion duty officer confirmed to British Transport Police that no weapons were missing from the armoury. British Transport Police said Dempsey's mobile phone revealed messages between him and Ashdown regarding large cash payments for "toys" - items believed to be the firearms seized at Carlisle. Further investigation revealed links to both Colquhoun and Kelly. On 16 August last year Colquhoun was captured on CCTV at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Paisley paying £3,500 into Dempsey's account. While arresting Kelly, Ashdown and Colquhoun police found £20,000 hidden in the loft of Kelly's house. Prosecutor Nicholas Kennedy said it was not known where the Uzi and handgun were from but the shotgun had been stolen in a burglary at farm buildings in Maidstone in February 2007. Sentencing the four, Judge Robert Warnock said: "I am wholly satisfied that they [the weapons] were destined for use in serious crime and had a clear potential for causing serious injury and death. "Had these firearms reached their intended recipients, I have no doubt they would have significantly contributed to the upward spiral of gun crime in this country." The judge told Demspey he had used his uniform to hide what he was doing on the day he was arrested. "For reasons principally to do with your abuse of alcohol and drugs, you abandoned the firearms at Carlisle station," he said. "I make it clear, however, that these actions were not motivated by remorse or insight but your befuddled and confused thinking brought on by your alcohol and drug abuse and your consequential paranoia and instability." The judge told Kelly he was "clearly a relatively sophisticated criminal who is well-versed in the use and abuse of mobile phone technology". He said his "employee" Colquhoun was a peripheral player in the conspiracy. The court heard that Ashdown, of no fixed address, was an active street dealer of drugs who was motivated to make money to fund his cocaine habit. He was jailed for an additional three years for possession and intent to supply cocaine in a separate case. Mitigating for Dempsey, David Thompson said his client had joined the Army at the age of 17 and had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was described as a "reliable and competent soldier" but his life began to go downhill last July. He had alcohol and drug problems and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his battleground stints. At the time he entered the firearms conspiracy he had accumulated a drug debt of £5,000. Mr Thompson said he was exposed to influences in his home town of Paisley - which he had joined the Army to get away from when he was younger. He said Dempsey "in effect abandoned the consignment at the rail station and disappeared into town." "He tells me he knew he was going to be arrested and was enjoying a final pint of beer." Mr Thompson said it was "a crying shame" that the defendant had become involved in a conspiracy "diametrically opposed" to the 12 years of service he had given to his country. "He is filled with remorse for getting involved and the shame he has brought upon his regiment," the barrister said. The court heard that Kelly maintained his innocence. Following sentencing, Det Ch Insp Simon Taylor, who led British Transport Police's investigation, said: "These four clearly intended to put illegal firearms on to the streets of Scotland and it is a fair assumption that they would have been used to commit criminal acts or to intimidate people. "In uncovering and unravelling the complex conspiracy BTP, in partnership with Kent Police and Police Scotland, have taken this potential threat out of circulation and ensured the conviction of four dangerous men." </body>

      <body>A second letter bomb addressed to a serving senior police officer has been discovered at a mail sorting office in Northern Ireland. The package was found at a Royal Mail depot in Lisburn, County Antrim. It comes hours after a device in a package addressed to the PSNI chief constable was intercepted at a sorting office in north Belfast. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said it was thought that dissident republicans were behind both incidents. He also blamed dissidents for pipe bomb attacks on police vehicles in Londonderry and the outskirts of Belfast over the last three days. "All four, along with other attacks this months, have been designed to kill police officers," he told a press conference on Friday. "We are very lucky we are not dealing with a fatality this morning." An Army bomb team dealt with the device at Mallusk, north Belfast, early on Friday. It had been addressed to Matt Baggott at police headquarters in Knock, east Belfast. Later, a delivery office at Linenhall Street, Lisburn, was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious object. The police said that both packages contained a viable device. Justice Minister David Ford said of the first device: "Those who sent this device have no concern whatsoever for the staff at the Mallusk sorting office, whose vigilance is to be commended." Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the Mallusk attack was "callous and reckless". "Those responsible for this device have almost no support and have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of those who could have been injured," she said. "The chief constable undertakes a challenging role in delivering community policing in a difficult environment." A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: "The Northern Ireland mail centre at Mallusk was evacuated overnight due to a suspect package. "Unfortunately there will be an effect on deliveries today and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause." Police have appealed for the public to be vigilant and report anything that looks suspicious. </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of the attempted murder of County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in Chicago three years ago. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, was convicted at Cook County Criminal Court in the US city on Thursday. The pair were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. Ms McShane, who had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault, has been left with severe brain damage. Just before 18:00 local time - midnight UK time - on Thursday, her family, along with Stacy Jurich and her family, were called for the verdict. The trial lasted five days, it took three and a half hours to find Viramontes guilty on all charges. There were emotional scenes as the verdicts were delivered. Shortly afterwards, a statement written by Natasha's brother, Conor, was read out to the press by the state's attorney. "This crime against my sister has changed my life forever. It has had a devastating impact on our entire family," the statement said. Conor McShane said the family was pleased and relieved at the verdicts. But he also said that Natasha's life had been ruined by the attack. She has been left unable to talk or walk unaided. Stacy Jurich said that the time since the attack had been the most difficult in her life. "We have had a lot of support from our families, friends and complete strangers," she said. "But the last three and a half years have been the hardest time in my entire life. Not only was it a struggle for me, but it has been a struggle to face what happened to my best friend, Natasha - something I will never forget." Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said: "Chicago is a beautiful city, it is a shame that someone like Natasha McShane, who was here to continue her schooling, someone who was visiting from Ireland, that she was not able to enjoy all the beauty that Chicago has to offer. "Instead of welcoming our visitors with an open heart, she was confronted with a baseball bat. I am very pleased that this man has been held responsible for the brutal and senseless beating of both Stacy Jurich and Natasha McShane." Viramontes faces between six and 120 years in prison. In July, his accomplice Marcy Cruz was jailed for 22 years after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted murder over the attack. </body>

      <body>A recycling firm has been fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen". Neath Port Talbot Recycling Ltd was also ordered to pay £50,000 costs following the incident in 2011. Swansea Crown court heard a similar incident happened in 2007 and over the following years the firm had been warned about its health and safety measures. The company said it deeply regretted what happened to employee Stephen John. The court was told how the 57-year-old was asked to clean a conveyor belt which had become blocked with a sticky black substance known as flack. The company did not have any risk assessment or safe system of work for completing this task, and experienced employees like Mr John had developed their own way of cleaning the conveyor belt roller. This system of work was devised partly because the control switch was located some distance away from the actual conveyor. To clean the rollers, one employee stood by the control switch, which is out of sight from the conveyor, and a second person inserted a bar and scraped the flack from the roller. He then inserted his arm to wipe away the flack. A command was given to the switch controller and the conveyor was started and stopped quickly. The process was repeated until the roller was clean. The court heard on the day of the incident, Mr John inserted his arm and was wiping the flack away. He then passed the bar to a work colleague. The switch controller misinterpreted this as a signal and started the conveyor. Mr John's right forearm was trapped and amputated by the conveyor belt. Speaking after the hearing, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector Sarah Baldwin-Jones said the potential for greater harm or a fatal accident was also a realistic possibility. "The company failed to fully guard the conveyor around the tail end roller and this failure resulted in employees having access to dangerous parts of the machine," she said. "The risk of entrapment is well known in the industry, and this company could have taken simple steps to fit guarding. "There was also no line of sight between Mr John and the employee operating the machinery and the company failed to carry out a risk assessment when the conveyor was installed. "They also failed to devise a safe way of cleaning the rollers and to instruct employees on how to clean them safely." Neath Port Talbot Recycling of Crymlyn Burrows, Swansea, pleaded guilty to two safety breaches. Managing director Will Watson told BBC Wales the company deeply regretted what had happened and that issues at the plant had now been addressed. </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <title>Militants raid north Nigerian city</title>
      <description>Militants engage security forces in a long gun battle in a key city in northern Nigeria, while the army says it has killed 74 militants elsewhere.</description>

      <body>Suspected Boko Haram militants have engaged security forces in a lengthy gun battle and raided a hospital in the northern Nigerian city of Damaturu. Residents told the BBC that it was a "big, audacious attack" and that assailants stole drugs from the hospital and drove off in ambulances. Meanwhile, the military said it had killed 74 suspected Boko Haram militants in a raid in Borno state. Authorities have recently stepped up their campaign against the militants. North-eastern Nigeria is the focus of an insurgency by the group that began in 2009 and aims to create an Islamic state. President Goodluck Jonathan urged the military to up its campaign against Boko Haram five months ago. Damaturu is the main city in Yobe state, which lies to the west of Borno. It has been calm for more than a year, and there is a large military presence in there. Nonetheless, gunfire rocked the city for some seven hours after a group of about 20 gunmen - some in military uniform - targeted the hospital late on Thursday. Clashes between militants and the security forces spread to other parts of the city. A health worker described seeing a police vehicle ferrying corpses to the mortuary. The resident who described the attack as "audacious" said the gunfire was heavy, continuous, and loud. He also said that people in Damaturu were surprised that it had taken the military at least an hour to respond. Authorities later imposed a 24-hour curfew, and streets were deserted on Friday. The military raid in Borno state involved "ground and aerial assault" and "led to the destruction of the identified terrorist camps," said army spokesman Lt Mohammed Dole. Lt Dole said the latest raid had been carried out on Thursday and that two soldiers had been wounded. The BBC's Will Ross reports from Nigeria that it seems surprising that Boko Haram camps are still being found, given all the resources available to the army. The army's claims about military operations against the group are hard to verify - there has been no mobile phone network in Borno state since the latest offensive was launched. Nigeria's campaign has been criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International said earlier this month that hundreds had died in detention in north-eastern Nigeria, some from starvation or extra-judicial killings. Nigeria's interior said the report was "not true". </body>

      <description>Kenya's interior minister fires 15 immigration officers over security lapses as investigations into the Westgate shopping centre siege continue.</description>

      <body>Kenya's interior minister has sacked 15 immigration officers as investigations into the Westgate mall siege continue. Joseph Ole Lenku said the officials had endangered national security by issuing ID documents to illegal immigrants. He also said the government would start repatriating Somali refugees to prevent further attacks. At least 67 people died when militants from the Somali Islamist al-Shabab group attacked the Nairobi shopping centre last month. Kenya is host to the largest refugee camp in the world, Dadaab - home to about half a million people - near the Somali border, while it is believed that more than 30,000 Somali refugees live in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, alone. Mr Lenku said the sacked immigration officers would appear in court to face the law. The government would also be carrying out a thorough audit of identity cards and passports issued in the country in the last two years, he said. "This exercise will enable us flush out all those who have been issued with illegal passports and other identification documents," Kenya's Star newspaper quoted him as saying. "We have welcomed with open arms, refugees fleeing from insecurity in neighbouring countries but we won't allow them to harm us," he added in his address to journalists in Nairobi. "Because of the returning calm in some parts of the Federal Republic of Somali, the process of repatriating Somali refugees has started," he said. Kenya has about 4,000 troops in the south of Somalia as part of the UN-backed African Union force which has made significant advances against al-Shabab in the last two years, recapturing the area's main cities. But the militants still control many smaller towns and large rural areas of southern Somalia. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nairobi says this is not the first time those fleeing the violence in neighbouring Somalia have been thrust uncomfortably into the spotlight. Even before Westgate, some politicians had blamed elements in the country's Dadaab refugee camp for attacks inside Kenya, he says. Previous attempts to repatriate Somali refugees have met with strong resistance, both from the UN and Kenya's own courts, our reporter adds. But more than a month after the attack on the shopping mall, the Kenyan government is under pressure - both its handling of intelligence and its response to the attack itself have been called into question, he says. Somalia's envoy to Kenya, Mohamed Ali Nur, has warned against blaming the refugees. "These refugees who are in the camps are innocent people. I want to say that the refugees themselves have been victims. Some of them were killed, some women were raped, and kids were killed," Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper quoted him as saying on Tuesday. Al-Shabab, which is part of the al-Qaeda network, is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK and is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters. Its members are fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and the group said it had staged the Westgate attack in response to Kenya's presence on Somali territory. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants, who the Kenyan military say all died by the end of the siege. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the four attackers is suspected of being a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. </body>

      <title>China court rejects Bo Xilai appeal</title>
      <description>A high court in China has rejected the appeal of top politician Bo Xilai, jailed for life for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</description>

      <body>A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of former politician Bo Xilai and upheld his life sentence for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. The former Chongqing Communist Party leader was convicted of the charges in September. He was removed from office in 2012 amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of a British businessman's murder. The high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held, accepted his appeal earlier this month. "The facts of the first instance verdict are clear, the evidence is reliable, sufficient and the sentence is appropriate," the high court said in its ruling, which was posted on its website. "The court rules as follows: reject the appeal, uphold the original verdict. This verdict is the final ruling." The hearing appeared to have been brief, with the verdict coming about an hour after a convoy believed to be carrying Bo was seen arriving at the court. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed Bo's elder son, Li Wangzhi, in court with other relatives. Bo only receives one chance to appeal and his sentence is now final. He could submit a complaint to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, but the vast majority of such complaints are rejected and do not result in another trial, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing. Correspondents said few expected Bo's conviction to be overturned. The courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, from which Bo was expelled from last year. Bo Xilai, the charismatic former party chief in the city of Chongqing in south-western China, was a member of the powerful politburo - one of the 25 most senior party officials in the country. But he was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu. The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder. Bo himself was found guilty of taking bribes amounting to 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) either personally or through his family. He was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime. Bo's supporters, however, believe he is the victim of a political purge. His downfall came as China prepared for its once-in-a-decade leadership transfer, as one generation of leaders made way for the next. Bo had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades. The final verdict in the Bo case comes weeks before the Communist Party holds a major meeting in November to set economic policy. </body>

      <title>North Korea returns six S Koreans</title>
      <description>North Korea returns six South Korean men, aged between 27 and 67, to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare handover.</description>

      <body>North Korea has returned six South Korean men to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare move. The men, between the ages of 27 and 67, were handed over on Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, on the border between the two countries. Their names were not released and details surrounding their detention in the North remain unclear. The two Koreas remain technically at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Pyongyang's Red Cross informed Seoul that the men would be handed back via Panmunjom on Thursday, a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry said. Officials said the group would be taken to South Korea's spy agency to face questions over their presence in North Korea. The South Korean government said that at first glance, the men were not on the list of those abducted by the North. One possibility is that they may have crossed into North Korea illegally from China, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says. Unofficial travel to North Korea by private citizens from South Korea is illegal, Pyongyang's state news agency announced the detention of several unnamed South Korean nationals in 2010 and there is speculation that they may be among those returned, our correspondent adds. The move by North Korea is seen as a gesture of reconciliation following the cancellation of reunions for families split by the division of the Korean peninsula at the end of the Korean War which were planned for last month. Tensions between the two Koreas rose earlier this year, after North Korea's third nuclear test in February. </body>

      <title>US spying 'may harm terror fight'</title>
      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels said distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders said that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. German spy chiefs are travelling to Washington next week to press for action over the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Both Germany and France want talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the end of the year. As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the US National Security Agency (NSA) has monitored millions of telephone calls by both German and French citizens. Spain on Friday followed Germany and France in summoning the US ambassador to explain reports of spying on the country. The UK's Guardian newspaper has reported that it obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said a review of US intelligence gathering, called for by President Obama, would look at how it affects foreign policy. The "high level group of outside experts... will consider as part of this how we can maintain the public's trust, how the surveillance impacts our foreign policy, particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public," she said. The EU leaders' statement, released earlier on Friday, reflected their conclusions following talks on Thursday. It said the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement said the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism," it continued. And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field," the leaders' statement also said. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said the aim of the initiative "is about knowing about the past and setting a framework for the future and putting an end to monitoring mechanisms that are not controlled". Germany and France said they are proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. But Mrs Merkel stressed Berlin and Paris would be making their own separate approaches to Washington. BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. Mrs Merkel said she did not know the exact details of the Five Eyes arrangement so could not say whether that is exactly what Germany is seeking, but added: "We need something clear-cut, in line with the spirit of an alliance". UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the UK's "unique partnership" with the US regarding security but said: "I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama". When asked by the BBC if the US had ever monitored Mr Cameron's phone, White House National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said: "His communications have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US." 'Look to the future' The spying revelations have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which framed the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. A number leaders indicated their support for the French and German position. Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <title>Women gain as gender gap 'narrows'</title>
      <description>The gender gap is narrowing across the world, a World Economic Forum report suggests, with Nordic countries leading the way but Arab nations lagging behind.</description>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <body>At least one person has died and dozens more are injured in an explosion and fire that tore through a sweet factory in northern Mexico. A boiler is believed to have exploded in the Dulces Blueberry factory at an industrial park in Ciudad Juarez, causing the ceiling to collapse. About 300 people were said to be in the factory at the time and several are still unaccounted for. Fire crews and about 30 ambulances were at the scene. Ciudad Juarez Civil Protection Director Fernando Mota said firefighters found a body inside the factory and that six of the injured were in a serious condition. He said several workers were missing and could be trapped inside the building. "We're still searching the area to see if there are more dead," he added. Footage from the scene showed local people gathering outside, many of them in tears as they awaited news of friends or relatives. Paramedics were treating the injured, some of whom were badly burned. Ciudad Juarez is in the state of Chihuahua on the border with the US state of Texas. Factories such as the one affected, known as maquiladoras, are located in a free trade zone between the United States and Mexico. They are estimated to employ more than one million Mexicans. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City says maquiladoras are often criticised by labour rights groups for their low wages and poor working conditions, as they try to compete with China to manufacture cheap goods for the US market. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>
      <description>Cuba is to scrap its divisive two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report.</description>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <title>Car bomb targets Syrian mosque</title>
      <description>At least 20 have been killed and many others injured in a car bomb blast outside a mosque in Syria's Damascus province, activists say.</description>

      <body>At least 20 people including children have been reported killed in a car bomb blast in Syria, outside a mosque in a town in Damascus province. The blast, in the town of Suq Wadi Barada, came just before the end of Friday prayers and brought down the mosque's entrances. It was not clear who had carried out the attack. Meanwhile, Norway has turned down a request to help the UN dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. The UN has set a deadline of mid-2014 for the weapons to be destroyed. Sweden has offered to provide an air force unit to transport the weapons. But Norway, asked by the US to help destroy the arms, said it was "not the most suitable location" for the work. At least three children were among the dead and dozens more wounded in Friday's car bombing, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. While Suq Wadi Barada was under opposition control, government forces were positioned just outside the town, it said. State news agency Sana said one of the victims was aged seven. It blamed opposition forces, saying the bomb exploded while it was being assembled. Rebel leaders blamed government troops. Car bombs have become a common, deadly occurrence in the long-running conflict. Earlier this week, a truck bomb in the central city of Hama killed at least 30 and wounded dozens more. Observatory figures show the 31-month conflict has killed more than 115,000 people. More than five million people are displaced inside Syria, and another two million have fled the country as refugees, according to the UNHCR. In other developments on Friday, government troops appeared to have ambushed a rebel position near the capital, part of an offensive on rebel-held areas around Damascus. State media said 40 rebels had died, while activists reported 20 deaths. The area is part of Eastern Ghouta region, scene of August's poison gas attack which killed hundreds of civilians and prompted a UN Security Council resolution calling for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) issued a warning Friday that continuous heavy bombing had forced 130,000 people out of al-Safira in the north. They said aid agencies could not cope with the numbers as winter approaches. "These people arrive in areas that already host a large number of displaced people, where the rare humanitarian players that are present are faced with huge needs," Marie-Noelle Rodrigue, MSF head of operations said in a statement. Fighting has also spread to northern Lebanon. The northern city of Tripoli has seen five days of street battles between supporters and opponents of the Syrian regime, killing five and injuring more than 40. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio epidemic fears grow</title>
      <description>The number of suspected cases of polio among children in Syria is believed to have risen sharply, with at least 22 people now thought to be suffering from the disease, health officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 22 people - most of them babies and toddlers - are now believed to have contracted polio in Syria, the World Health Organization has reported. If confirmed, it would be the first outbreak of the disease there in 14 years. Syria's Health Ministry began an immunisation drive on Thursday. Before Syria's civil war began in 2011, some 95% of children were vaccinated against the disease. Now, Unicef estimates 500,000 children have not been immunised. WHO said the suspected outbreak centres on the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. "There is a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis cases that is being investigated in that area," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer told Reuters news agency. "Everybody is treating this as an outbreak and is in outbreak response mode." Two cases have already been confirmed by laboratory tests while the WHO expects final laboratory confirmation on the remaining 20 cases next week. There are more than 100,000 children, all under age five, now at risk of polio in Deir Ezzor province alone, which has been caught in fierce battles between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters. The city of Deir Ezzor remains partially controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, while the countryside is in the hands of the opposition. The WHO is now working with the UN, Syria's Health Ministry and other agencies on a mass immunisation programme. But it is expected to be a difficult undertaking, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva, given the widespread insecurity and estimates that over half of Syria's medical professionals have left the country. More than four million Syrians have been displaced internally by the conflict and generally live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO has already reported increases in cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A. Aid agencies are also developing emergency immunisation plans for Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. "Obviously, we're extremely worried about the situation," Simon Ingram, a spokesman for Unicef's operations in the Middle East, told the BBC. "People are flooding across borders in an uncontrolled manner and this increases the possibilities and means by which the virus can spread." The highly contagious disease is most often spread by consuming food or liquid contaminated with faeces. Polio has been largely eradicated in developed countries but remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Worldwide, polio cases have fallen from an estimated 350,000 at the start of a WHO-led immunisation campaign in 1988 to just 223 reported cases last year. There is no known cure, though a series of vaccinations can confer immunity. Young children are particularly susceptible to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. </body>

      <body>A former National Security Agency (NSA) chief giving off-the-record interviews on a high-speed train has had his remarks reported live on Twitter. General Michael Hayden was talking off-the-record to journalists by phone when he was overheard by another passenger, a former political activist. Tom Matzzie said he waited half an hour before live-tweeting comments about US renditions and a "famous BlackBerry". The comments went viral on news websites and late-night television. Gen Hayden, who was alerted to the Twitter feed within about 15 minutes, then offered an interview to Mr Matzzie, who is now head of a company called Ethical Electric. "I just had a very nice conversation with Michael Hayden. He was a gentleman and we disagree," Mr Matzzie later tweeted. The two men were on a high-speed Acela train travelling from Washington, DC to New York late on Thursday afternoon. Mr Matzzie began tweeting details of the conversations from what he said was a distance of 8ft (about 2.4m) away. "On Acela listening to former NSA spy boss Michael Hayden give 'off record' interviews. I feel like I'm in the NSA. Except I'm in public," Mr Matzzie's Twitter feed read. The National Security Agency has come under intense criticism after revelations by ex-CIA contractor Edward Snowden that US intelligence conducted extensive web and phone surveillance on targets at home and abroad. Mr Snowden now faces espionage charges in the US and has been granted temporary asylum in Russia. Gen Hayden has defended his former agency's operations in the past and Mr Matzzie wrote that Thursday's interviews were also focused on NSA surveillance of foreign allies. As the former head of MoveOn.org Political Action, Mr Matzzie once campaigned against the US-led war in Iraq. He made clear his own feelings about the former NSA and CIA chief with a tweet reading, "There is a faint smell of sulfur on the train." He said Gen Hayden asked journalists to refer to him as a "former senior administration official" for comments described as "disparaging" to President Barack Obama's administration. Gen Hayden later gave a statement to the Reuters news agency saying he "didn't criticise" the president. "I actually said these are very difficult issues. I said I had political guidance, too, that limited the things that I did when I was director of NSA. Now that political guidance is going to be more robust. It wasn't a criticism," Gen Hayden said. </body>

      <title>JonBenet parents 'should be charged'</title>
      <description>In 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to charge the parents of slain child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey in her 1996 murder, court documents show.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-24675182</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70722000/jpg/_70722945_jonbenet.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A Colorado grand jury was prepared to charge the parents of a slain six-year-old beauty queen in her death, newly released court documents in the 17-year-old murder case show. The panel voted in 1999 to charge JonBenet Ramsey's parents with fatal child abuse and "accessory to a crime". But prosecutors declined to try John and Patsy Ramsey on any charges. JonBenet's body was found brutally beaten and strangled in her Boulder, Colorado, home in December 1996. The Ramseys always maintained their innocence. Lin Wood, a lawyer for John Ramsey, said the documents released on Friday meant "absolutely zero" to the investigation. "The documents today are a mere historical footnote, a small glimpse into the grand jury proceedings," Mr Wood said in a statement. "It's four pages of what would have likely been hundreds of volumes of testimony and exhibit." The prosecutor at the time, Alex Hunter, has not commented about the newly released documents. Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006. The investigation into JonBenet's death gained national attention in the US after grisly details of the crime and videos of the girl performing in beauty pageants were publicised. The Ramseys were never charged, and DNA evidence eventually suggested someone else killed the girl. In 2008, prosecutors formally exonerated them in the murder and publicly apologised. Her killing remains unsolved. The release on Friday of the grand jury indictments came after a lawsuit by the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP). The 1999 documents show the grand jury moved to charge Mr and Mrs Ramsey with child abuse resulting in death and with being an accessory to a crime. The documents allege the couple placed their daughter "in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health" which led to her death, and then helped the killer evade discovery and prosecution. Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney at the time, declined to sign the indictments, effectively dropping the charges. "I and my prosecutorial team believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time," Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney, said in 1999. Analysts say it is uncommon for a district attorney not to sign off on a grand jury decision. US grand juries are convened in secret and tasked with determining whether enough evidence exists to bring a suspect to trial. But prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict - a substantially higher bar. JonBenet's body was found in the basement of her home on 26 December 1996 after her parents reported her missing. Her skull was fractured and she had been strangled. The couple offered a $100,000 (£61,700) reward for information about the killer. The Boulder police were also faulted for botching the initial search of the Ramseys' home. In 2008, former District Attorney Mary Lacy publically apologised to the Ramseys after new DNA evidence suggested the killer was not a family member. </body>

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

The rating means Iceland is the country where women enjoy the most equal access to education and healthcare. It is also where women are most likely to be able to participate fully in the country's political and economic life. Iceland is joined at the top of the The Global Gender Gap Report, 2013 by its Nordic neighbours Finland, Norway and Sweden. Overall, the gender gap narrowed slightly across the globe in 2013, as 86 of 133 countries showed improvements. However, "change is definitely slow", says one of the report's authors, Saadia Zahidi.

      <title>How do leaders cope with bugging?</title>
      <description>Why world leaders don't like using secure phones</description>

      <body>The most common reaction to news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by the US National Security Agency appears to be world-weary resignation. Followed by a sly suggestion that someone of her experience and stature should have known better. Kurt Volker, former US ambassador to Nato 2008-2009, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme "every country spies" and he could not believe that the revelations were a surprise to anyone. Lord West, a security minister under Gordon Brown, said he had "always worked on the assumption" that people were listening to his phone calls. "I know they jolly well were," he told Today. "I don't think it's surprising that people try and listen. If you are a head of state there are lots of people, not just other states, who are listening. "There are companies, all sorts of people, who want to hear what you are saying and I think you have to be extremely careful." A former senior British diplomat, who did not want to be named, told the BBC News website he always worked on the assumption that his phone calls were being listened to. This could sometimes be turned to the British delegation's advantage, he explained, by reinforcing the message that they were trying to get across in negotiations in supposedly private phone conversations, knowing full well that they would be intercepted. But at the same time, it was worth remembering when reading reports of what the representatives of other nations were saying that they were probably up to the same game, he added. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett recently revealed that Nicolas Sarkozy, the then French interior minister, tried to save time in negotiations over the closure of the Sangatte transit camp by saying he already knew the British position because the French secret service had intercepted unencrypted Home Office emails. But not everyone is quite so sanguine. Clare Short, who made headlines and provoked fury in Downing Street in 2004 when she revealed that the British secret service had bugged the office and telephone of then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, says she was genuinely "shocked" by the Merkel revelations. The former international development secretary also rejects the argument that Mrs Merkel's anger is for the benefit of the German public, many of whom are still haunted by the memory of the Stasi. "I am sure she was very angry and upset. These were her friends and now [she finds] they don't trust her," says Ms Short. Ms Short said she was regularly given intelligence reports about what Mr Annan was saying in the supposed privacy of his office but she became increasingly uncomfortable about this in the run-up to the Iraq war. She recalls the surreal and disturbing experience of chatting to Kofi Annan on her mobile phone and realising that someone would probably be listening in and transcribing every word. She says she can not recall any examples of being handed intelligence reports about what friendly powers were saying to each other on the phone during her time in office, from 1997 to 2003. But she says she was approached by "successive Cs" - the code name for the head of MI6 - offering to spy on the leaders of friendly nations in Africa. "I told them, 'No of course not. We don't want to spy on the people we are working with,'" she tells the BBC News website. She also explodes one popular myth about notorious technophobe Tony Blair - that he did not carry a mobile phone during his years in power. "I don't really believe that," she says, adding that it might be part of Downing Street myth-making: "It makes him more emperor-like." All heads of state, in the Western world at least, will have access to encrypted mobile phones and other secure lines. The problem, for security staff, is convincing world leaders to take the espionage threat seriously. Shortly after taking office in 2008, Barack Obama managed to convince the secret service to let him keep his own Blackberry, despite fears it would broadcast his location and make him vulnerable to hacking. Mr Obama is said to be frustrated about having to live in the White House "bubble", cut off from the outside world and unable to communicate with normal people. The President's Blackberry is often seen on his belt and he is sometimes pictured scrolling through his messages as he travels in his limousine. In France, senior officials have access to a secure intranet and phone network - but the country's leaders are reported to be reluctant to use the slow and restrictive system, which can take up to 30 seconds to place a call. President Francois Hollande is said to have followed predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy by holding on to his personal smartphone. Mobile phones are banned in No 10 - you have to hand them in at the door - over fears foreign powers are listening in. All calls in and out are routed through a secure switchboard staffed by officials - a system which continues when the prime minister is travelling. Downing Street is remaining tight-lipped about the latest bugging revelations. Asked earlier if the prime minister was still using his mobile phone, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: "I haven't seen him use a different one". </body>

      <title>Corden on singing like Paul Potts</title>
      <description>James Corden on becoming Paul Potts</description>

      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the microphone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it, seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <body>There's been a wave of popularity for drinks like the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". Why are people turning their backs on sweet cocktails in favour of a bitter taste? The last two decades have seen an extraordinary resurgence in cocktail-making on both sides of the Atlantic, with everything from Cointreau-sweetened Cosmopolitans to sugary Mojitos being drunk in vast quantities. But there is now a definite trend towards bitter drinks. People are ordering whisky or gin-based drinks paired with vermouths. And there is growing interest in the US, UK and other European nations in Italian amari. These complex, herbal, bittersweet drinks, with names like Averna, Ramazzotti, Montenegro and Fernet Branca, are usually consumed as aperitivi or digestivi - drinks thought to either encourage the appetite before dinner or help with digestion afterwards. Their bitter mixer cousins, Cynar, Campari and Aperol, are increasingly being used in cocktails. Aperol - based on bitter orange and rhubarb and containing classic bitter ingredients like gentian and cinchona (a source of quinine) - has rocketed in popularity in recent years following a push by owner Gruppo Campari. Sales rose 156% in the UK in 2012 and 56% in the US. This year's figures, announced soon, are expected to be even bigger. A poster campaign in the UK encourages people to try an Aperol spritz - prosecco sparkling wine and soda water mixed with Aperol. A fundamental point of the spritz is its low alcohol content. Aperol's slogan is "poco alcolico", roughly meaning a little bit alcoholic. "I think the Aperol spritz was probably the most asked-for drink in the outdoor areas of most decent bars in London this summer," says World Duty Free mixologist Charlie McCarthy. Laura Tallo, from Nonna's Italian Cucina in Bath, says many British drinkers have returned after holidays in Italy, having seen certain drinks paired with tavola calda - the selection of hot, freshly-baked food. "People are definitely beginning to embrace the Italian custom of drinking aperitifs. We have seen a definite trend emerging of people choosing classic Italian pre-dinner drinks such as an Aperol spritz, Negroni [equal parts Campari, gin and sweet vermouth], Americano or Martini," she says. Such drinks are not to everyone's taste, of course. While many Italians have been brought up around the tradition of amari, they can baffle non-Italian palates at first taste. "They say of a Negroni the first two or three sips you despise, and after you have had two or three drinks you start to like it," says Tom Ross, bars manager of the Polpo restaurant group in London. The taste of Fernet Branca - vaguely minty but with pungent undertones of cough medicine - is so powerful that comedian Bill Cosby constructed a seven-minute anecdote around his initial horror on encountering the drink in Italy. And yet Fernet is loved by many, being drunk with cola in Argentina and - accompanied by a separate shot of ginger beer - known as the "bartender's handshake" in San Francisco. One of the first recorded definitions of a cocktail was in a New York journal in 1803, which classified it as a mixture of any "spirituous liquor", with water, sugar and "bitters", known at the time as a bittered sling. You can find the descendant of these traditional bitters (with the term typically referring to both singular and plural) in any decent bar in the UK or US. There'll be a rather unusual bottle among the others - small with a yellow top and an oversized label covered in small print. It is the world's most famous cocktail bitters, Angostura. This bitters is the key ingredient in pink gin, the traditional officers' cocktail in the Royal Navy. It's also the bedrock of famous cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, beloved of Mad Men's Don Draper, and the Manhattan. A supply shortage in 2009 caused panic throughout the world's bartending community, according to McCarthy, and prompted bartenders to start making their own. The current wave of speakeasy-type bars inspired by the prohibition years in the US, has prompted interest in traditional and hitherto forgotten cocktails. This in turn has prompted demand for more unusual bitters. Bob Petrie, of Bob's Bitters, started in 2005 when he was approached by the Dorchester Hotel to create a range. Traditional bitters are very complex, with aromatic flavours brought out from a combination of barks, roots, herbs, and spices by macerating them in alcohol. He looked at pairing them with the "botanicals" in gin, and came up with a range including cardamom, chocolate, coriander, ginger, grapefruit, lavender, liquorice, orange and mandarin, peppermint and vanilla. "Single flavours are a lot easier for the barman as it gives a lot more scope," Petrie says. "What they can do with mine is mix and match." Rochdale-born US celebrity mixologist Gary Regan is another who was prompted to make his own to replicate the orange bitters in some old cocktail recipes. "When I realised it was hard to get good ones I decided to make my own. I stole a recipe from the Gentleman's Companion of 1939. I had about four different trials and eventually got something I liked. "This shift towards bitter has been going on for eight years," Regan estimates. "[But] most bitters aren't that bitter. They taste herbal. In fact, they are a bit on the sweet side sometimes." Fee Brothers in Rochester, New York, has been making bitters since 1863, with a short break for prohibition. Joe and Ellen Fee are the fourth generation. Their 92-year-old father still regularly visits the plant. Joe Fee says there has been a marked increase in sales over the past seven years. "Just about anything can be made into a bitters. They are your spice rack behind the bar." "I am the Willy Wonka of the cocktail mixers," boasts Ellen Fee, who conjures up the new flavours. "I like to think in terms of what flavour is already bitter. Cocoa powder is bitter, cranberry is bitter. You add to that and make it more interesting." The plethora of these cocktail tinctures and potions shows the tastes of aficionados have shifted. But there are other flagbearers for a more bitter palate. Many James Bond fans attempt to recreate the Vesper Martini from Casino Royale. Bond asks for it to be made with strong gin, vodka and the bitter Kina Lillet. Lillet took out much of the bitter quinine in the 1980s and fans tend to use Cocchi Americano Italian vermouth instead. And the Queen has followed in her mother's footsteps by drinking gin and Dubonnet - the quinine-bittered French aperitif. Just a few years ago, her choice was seen as unusual. Now she's part of an established trend. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>What is the point of government consultations?</description>

      <body>What is the point of government consultations? I pose the question at the end of a week in which ministers responded to three official consultations on three controversial proposals - and appeared to ignore the results from them all. On Monday, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on planned changes to the assessment of people with disabilities in determining their entitlement to benefits. The government had conducted the consultation, it said, "in a fully open-minded manner". Ministers had carefully considered all the views expressed. The consultation focused on plans limiting entitlement to extra help for mobility needs to those who cannot walk 20m. The overwhelming response was that this was a bad idea. "Respondents felt there was no evidence to support the use of 20m," the consultation reported, pointing out "that other government policies use 50m as a measure of mobility". In a section entitled "What you told us", the DWP notes concern that the plan "could increase isolation and reduce independence, have significant financial impact, and cause deterioration in their physical and mental health". Respondents warned that the 20m criteria would mean some disabled people needing support from other public services, increasing the cost for the government. "The most common suggestion made by respondents", the DWP reports, "was to extend the qualifying distance for the enhanced rate from 20m to a longer distance". Nowhere in the government's response to the consultation is there evidence that anyone thought the 20m criteria was the right policy. "Having considered all these factors", the DWP response concludes, "the government believes that the use of 20m is the best way of identifying those whose physical mobility is most limited". It is, of course, the democratic right of ministers to consult and to listen and then ignore. The arguments put forward by the DWP may be compelling. But it does lead some to ask whether the consultation really had much value. A similar question might be posed following the government's response on Tuesday to consultations on two proposals concerning immigrants. The Home Office published the results of the public consultation on plans for a levy on temporary non-EEA migrants as a contribution towards the costs of possible NHS care while in the UK. It is a move that ministers claim enjoys considerable public support, but the consultation came back with a rather different view. On the principle of a levy, "34% felt that temporary migrants should make a direct contribution to the costs of their healthcare. Sixty-two per cent disagreed," it found. The Home Office notes differences depending upon the "type of respondent". Among the general public, 65% were against the plan. Among organisations that responded, 77% were opposed. Health-sector respondents, however, were in favour - 66% felt temporary migrants should contribute to the cost of their healthcare. It is the view of 235 health sector respondents, representing around 12% of the total, that appears to have swayed ministers most. "We have considered all responses to these questions carefully but remain convinced that only permanent migrants should be automatically eligible for free NHS care." Consultations are not referendums. In a way, it seems odd the Home Office should go to such trouble to quantify the proportions for and against the policy since the exercise is not designed as an X-factor style public vote. But having conducted a public consultation and expressing gratitude to all those "who have taken the time to respond and to those who have contributed their experience and insight to what is a complex issue", one is left wondering what the point was. The government response to a separate consultation, also published on Tuesday, invites the same question. This time the proposal under scrutiny was the introduction of a legal obligation on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. "While between one-third and two-fifths of respondents supported the proposal," the Home Office response states, "slightly more than half of all respondents disagreed." The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors considered it "inappropriate to use private landlords and lettings agents to help deliver the government's immigration policy". The majority of landlord representative organisations were opposed. "The most widely expressed concern by third sector organisations," the Home Office reveals, "was the potential to impact on vulnerable people, such as those who were homeless, those with learning difficulties and those fleeing domestic abuse". The response? "The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation and remains convinced of an urgent need for action to deter illegal migration and to safeguard the legitimate housing market." The consultation may lead to ministers including an amendment designed to counter discrimination against foreign national tenants. But on the broad proposal, it seems the exercise has not shifted government thinking one jot. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), "public consultation is one of the key regulatory tools employed to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation". But there has long been scepticism as to whether such exercises are anything more than cosmetic. The public consultation is an opportunity for ministers to test their ideas with experts, those directly affected and voters more generally. Community participation on proposed legislation is seen as a key component of "citizen power". But formal public consultation exercises very rarely result in a government re-think - even if they reveal profound concern. That is not the point of them, and we should not pretend otherwise. </body>

      <title>Sifting through the data mountain</title>
      <description>What is the use of performance figures to patients?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24651405</url>

      <body>The Care Quality Commission has gathered together a mountain of data. A total of 161 hospital trusts have been assessed against 150 measures from mortality and infection rates to errors and patient survey results. Even taking into account the fact that not all the data was applicable to every trust there is still well over 12,000 bits of data to wade through. So how can patients navigate their way around it? The first thing to say is that this is not a final judgement on hospital trusts. That will come over the next two years as the inspection programme is rolled out. Instead, the CQC has referred to it as a screening tool rather than diagnosis - it is to be used to prioritise which trust to visit first. But that does not mean it cannot and should not be used by patients. What the regulator has done is pull together all the key bits of information already available on performance and provided an analysis of which hospital trusts are furthest outside the expected range. Until the inspection process is complete, it is perhaps the most comprehensive and informative assessment of what is happening in the NHS at the moment. But it does not mean the exercise is fool-proof. That much is clear already. For example, four of the trusts put into special measures earlier this year because of serious concerns about standards did not make it into the highest risk band one category. In fact two (Burton Hospitals and George Eliot) ended up in band three. Although all were subsequently bumped up to band one because of the issues already identified. When the final ratings are produced it is likely some of those judged low risk will get a bad rating, while some of the high risk ones will be given a good or outstanding rating. One of the reasons for this may be related to the fact the different measures have not been weighted for seriousness. For example a trust with a high sickness rate or poor uptake of vaccination among its staff would get the same risk rating as another with a high mortality rate. In some ways, that is understandable. For example, a trust with high absence rates is likely to have a problem with morale and management. That is not good for patients. The problem is that we just do not know yet whether it is an accurate way of risk profiling. The regulator has promised to fine-tune its system as it goes along. Of the first 18 trusts to be inspected, there is an even spread between the top two bands, the middle two and the bottom two. That will give it an early indication of the accuracy of its methods. In the meantime, patients can pour through the individual reports that have been produced for each trust here. There is a summary page of the risks identified, setting out the areas for which the trust has a poor record. It will be up to patients to decide what to do with the information and whether they want to exercise choice where they can. But as one person who is heavily involved in analysing data for the NHS put it to me: "If you can avoid it, why would you go to a hospital where there is much more evidence of risk than another?" </body>

      <title>Dino impact 'also decimated bees'</title>

      <body>Scientists say there was a widespread extinction of bees 66 million years ago, at the same time as the event that killed off the dinosaurs. The demise of the dinosaurs was almost certainly the result of an asteroid or comet hitting Earth. But the extinction event was selective, affecting some groups more than others. Writing in Plos One journal, the team used fossils and DNA analysis to show that one bee group suffered a serious decline at the time of this collision. The researchers chose to study bees within the subfamily known as Xylocopinae - which included the carpenter bees. This was because the evolutionary history of this group could be traced back to the Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs still walked the Earth. Previous studies had suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event 66 million years ago. And it had long been assumed that the bees that depended upon these plants would have met the same fate. Yet, unlike the dinosaurs, "there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees," said the paper's lead author Sandra Rehan, a biologist at the University of New Hampshire in Dunham, US. This has made the confirmation of such an extinction difficult. However, the researchers were able to use an extinct group of Xylocopinae as a calibration point for timing the dispersal of these bees. They were also able to study flower fossils that had evolved traits that allowed them to be pollinated by bee relatives of the Xylocopinae. "The data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time," said Dr Rehan. "And it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct." The findings of this study could have implications for today's concern about the loss in diversity of bees, a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity. "Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today," Dr Rehan explained. </body>

      <title>Get outside and go wild, kids urged</title>
      <description>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time" by playing outside more to regain a connection with the natural world.</description>

      <body>Children are being urged to take back their "wild time", swapping 30 minutes of screen use for outdoor activities. The call to renew a connection with nature comes from a collaboration of almost 400 organisations, from playgroups to the NHS. The Wild Network wants children to take up activities like conkers and camping. "The tragic truth is that kids have lost touch with nature and the outdoors in just one generation," said chairman Andy Simpson. The organisers argue that swapping 30 minutes of television and computer games each day for outdoor play would increase the levels of fitness and alertness and improve children's well-being "Time spent outdoors is down, roaming ranges have fallen drastically, activity levels are declining and the ability to identify common species has been lost," said Mr Simpson. He referred to recent research by the RSPB which suggested only one in five children aged eight to 12 had a connection with nature. "With many more parents becoming concerned about the dominance of screen time in their children's lives, and growing scientific evidence that a decline in active time is bad news for the health and happiness of our children, we all need to become marketing directors for nature," said Mr Simpson. "An extra 30 minutes of wild time every day for all under 12-year-olds in the UK would be the equivalent of just three months of their childhood spent outdoors. "We want parents to see what this magical wonder product does for their kids' development, independence and creativity, by giving wild time a go." The campaign launches on Friday with the release of a documentary film, Project Wild Thing. It tells the story of how, in a bid to get his daughter and son outside, film-maker David Bond appoints himself marketing director for nature, working with branding and outdoor experts to develop a campaign. "I wanted to understand why my children's childhood is so different from mine, whether this matters and, if it does, what I can do about it," said Mr Bond. "The reasons why kids, whether they live in cities or the countryside, have become disconnected from nature and the outdoors are complex. "Project Wild Thing isn't some misty-eyed nostalgia for the past. We need to make more space for wild time in children's daily routine, freeing this generation of kids to have the sort of experiences that many of us took for granted. "It's all about finding wildness on your doorstep and discovering the sights, sounds and smells of nature, whether in a back garden, local park or green space at the end of the road." The campaign, said to be the biggest ever aiming to reconnect children with the outdoors, includes the National Trust, the RSPB, Play England and the NHS, as well as playgroups, businesses and schools. </body>

      <title>Light shed on how genes shape face</title>
      <description>Scientists identify thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop.</description>

      <body>Scientists are starting to understand why one person's face can look so different from another's. Working on mice, researchers have identified thousands of small regions of DNA that influence the way facial features develop. The study also shows that tweaks to genetic material can subtly alter face shape. The findings, published in Science, could also help researchers to learn how facial birth defects arise. The researchers said that although the work was carried out on animals, the human face was likely to develop in the same way. Professor Axel Visel, from the Joint Genome Institute at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California, told BBC News: "We're trying to find out how these instructions for building the human face are embedded in human DNA. "Somewhere in there there must be that blueprint that defines what our face looks like." The international team has found more than 4,000 "enhancers" in the mouse genome that appear to play a role in facial appearance. These short stretches of DNA act like switches, turning genes on and off. And for 200 of these, the researchers have identified how and where they work in developing mice. Prof Visel said: "In the mouse embryos we can see where exactly, as the face develops, this switch turns on the gene that it controls." The scientists also looked at what happened when three of these genetic switches were removed from mice. "These mice looked pretty normal, but it is really hard for humans to see differences in the face of mice," explained Prof Visel. "The way we can get around this is to use CT scans to study the shapes of the skulls of these mice. We take them and scan their heads. then we can measure the shape of the skull of these mice and we can do this in a very precise way." By comparing the transgenic mice with unmodified mice, the researchers found that the changes were very subtle. However some mice developed longer or shorter skulls, while others have wider or narrower faces. "What this really tells us is that this particular switch also plays a role in development of the skull and can affect what exactly the skull looks like," he explained. Understanding this could also help to reveal why and how things can go wrong as embryos develop in the womb, leading to facial birth defects. Prof Visel said: "There are many kinds of craniofacial birth defects; cleft of the lip and palate are the most common ones. "And they have severe implications for the kids that are affected. They affect feeding, speech, breathing, they can require extensive surgery and they have psychological implications." While some of these are caused by genetic mutations, the researchers want to understand how the genetic switches interact. Professor Visel added that scientists were just at the beginning of understanding the processes that shape the face, but their early results suggested it was an extremely complex process. He said it was unlikely in the near future that DNA could be used to predict someone's exact appearance, or that parents could alter genetic material to change the way a baby looks. </body>

      <title>Seven-planet solar system found</title>
      <description>Astronomers have discovered the seventh planet orbiting a distant star, which they describe as one of the richest planetary systems known to science.</description>

      <body>Astronomers may have identified one of the richest planetary systems yet. The discovery of a seventh planet around the dwarf star KIC 11442793 could be a record, according to two separate teams of researchers. The system bears some similarities to our own, but all seven planets orbit much closer to their host star, which lies some 2,500 light-years from Earth. The crowded solar system is described in two papers published on the pre-print server Arxiv.org. One of the identifications was made by volunteers using the Planet Hunters website. The site was set up to allow volunteers to sift through the public data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope - which was launched to search for so-called exoplanets - worlds orbiting distant stars. Kepler uses the transit method to discover new planets, which entails looking for the dip in light as an alien world passes in front of its host star. But there is simply too much data for mission scientists to examine every light curve, so they developed computer programmes to search for the signature of a planetary transit. "This is the first seven-planet system from Kepler, using a transiting search. We think [the identification] is very secure," said Chris Lintott, from the University of Oxford, co-author on the Planet Hunters paper. "With a transiting system, once you get multiple planets, the odds of them being false positives are very small." Dr Lintott's team has submitted their research to the Astronomical Journal for peer review. Another team of astronomers from several European countries has submitted a separate paper outlining their independent discovery of the seventh planet to the Astrophysical Journal. The new planet is the fifth furthest from its parent star, orbiting with a period of nearly 125 days. With a radius of 2.8 times that of the Earth, it fits into a family that now includes two roughly Earth sized worlds, three "super-Earths" and two larger bodies. "It actually looks like our Solar System in one sense, with all the small planets on the inside and the big planets on the outside. And that's not necessarily what we always see," said co-author Robert Simpson, also from Oxford University. While there might be resemblances to our Solar System, all seven planets are closer to their host star. In fact they would all fit within the Earth's distance from the Sun, making this a very crowded neighbourhood. "This is one of the reasons they are easy to see, because the closer they are to their sun, the more frequently they go around it," said Dr Simpson. However, the Planet Hunters team carried out simulations showing that the planetary system should be a stable one. Dr Lintott, who co-presents the BBC's Sky at Night programme and helped found Planet Hunters, added: "Everything we know about this system tells us [the seventh planet] should have been found using the automatic detection routines. But it wasn't." "A seven-planet system is very complicated so you get a sense of why the automatic routine might have missed out - it gets confused by the presence of the other transits. "Looking for these transits seems like a task that's perfectly designed for computers. But we keep finding, in these niche cases, in these odd cases, in these complicated cases that humans can beat the computers." Another star, HD 10180, has been claimed to have either seven, or nine planetary signals. A distant sun called GJ 887C may also have a family of seven planets. Commenting on the paper by the Planet Hunters team, Andrew Collier Cameron, professor of astronomy at the University of St Andrews, said: "It's intriguing that a system as well-studied as KOI-351 can still harbour hidden surprises that can only be winkled out by human eyes." He added: "This is a perennial problem in transit hunting, of which we are only too acutely aware in our own ground-based searches. "The best transit signal-detection algorithms developed to date still come a very poor second to the human visual system when it comes to pattern recognition. Still, we have to rely on machines, because of the sheer volume of data produced by enterprises like transit searches." Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <body>Archaeologists in Peru have found two mummies more than 1,000 years old in a suburb of the capital, Lima. The mummies - of an adult and a child - were found at an ancient religious complex which has been under excavation since 1981. The child is believed to have been an offering to the gods and may have been buried alive after the adult's death. Researchers also found other offerings including the remains of guinea pigs and jars with feline designs. "This is one of the most important finds in more than three decades of excavation, because the mummies are intact," researcher Gladys Paz told the AFP news agency. The mummies are squatting and are fully dressed wrapped in rope. It is the third intact find among more than 70 tombs uncovered in the Huaca Pucllana tomb, a pyramid-like temple built by the pre-Columbian Wari culture between 100 and 600 AD in what is now the Miraflores neighbourhood. In 2010, archaeologists found the remains of a woman with four children, and in 2008, the remains of a teenage girl. The site was built on 2.5 hectares of land and towers over 20m (66ft) high. So far, only about 40% has been excavated. The Wari culture flourished between AD 500 to 1,000 on the coastal area of northern Peru. Little is known about them, as they did not appear to leave a written record. </body>

      <body>National Trust director-general Dame Helen Ghosh says the conservation charity has an "open mind" about allowing fracking on its land. Her comments appear to contradict the Trust's position of a "presumption against" the controversial technology. Campaigners say the environmental risks of fracturing rock to release gas are too great. A spokesman says the Trust has not changed its position but will review any new evidence in the future. Fracking is the process of drilling down into shale rock before a high-pressure water mixture is directed at the rock to release the gas inside. Water, sand and chemicals are injected into the rock at high pressure which allows the gas to flow out to the head of the well. In an interview with The Times Newspaper, Dame Helen said: "We all have yet to see what the surface environmental impact of fracking is and when we have seen it we would reach a view." She added: "We are waiting for the evidence. We have an open mind." However, the Trust's position on fracking says: "We have a presumption against fracking on our land because natural gas is a fossil gas. "The mining process also gives rise to potential environmental and landscape impacts." It goes on to say: "Whilst the use of natural gas might buy time to develop secure, renewable alternative energy sources, it also risks distracting us from focusing on the development of these and on the need for us all to concentrate on using less energy in the first place. 'Fool's gold' A Trust spokesman said: "Our position is a presumption against fracking on our land. "It doesn't mean that in time that won't change - if the environmental and visual impacts are negligible and it is part of a strategy to move to a low carbon economy." The Trust adopted its position of a presumption against the gas/oil extraction technique during the summer's anti-fracking protests at Balcombe, West Sussex, where energy company Caudrilla planned to carry out test drilling. Earlier this year, the charity's director of conservation, Peter Nixon, described fracking as "fool's gold". He said: "If it takes our eyes off the ball from the need for energy efficiency and a long-term sustainable source of renewable energy, it will be fool's gold." The spokesman told BBC News: "Shale gas is a fossil fuel [that] may prove a fool's gold and distract attention from a shift to renewables. "The environmental and visual impacts are also unproven, and this is what concerns many people. We want to see more evidence on what this impact will be." </body>

      <title>Badger cull extension confirmed</title>
      <description>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire is to be extended for a further eight weeks, Natural England confirms.</description>

      <body>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire will continue for another eight weeks after a licence was granted, Natural England has confirmed. During the six-week period of the original licence, 708 badgers were killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but protesters say it has little effect. A licence has already been granted to extend the Somerset cull to 1 November. Natural England said it had granted the extension after taking advice from Defra's chief veterinary officer and chief scientific adviser who said failure to extend would raise the risk of increasing the spread of TB by dispersing badgers. The new licence, which runs until 18 December, specifies that a minimum of 540 and a maximum of 940 badgers can be culled in order to control the disease. 'Badger cull madness' As the close season for cage trapping and shooting begins on 1 December, only controlled shooting will be permitted from 1-18 December. Animal welfare charity, Humane Society International (HSI) UK, said it was "appalled" to hear the extension had been granted. The charity said prolonging the shooting "is the very worst thing the government can do because it increases the risk of spreading bovine TB as badgers flee the area". Gloucestershire resident Mark Jones, who is executive director of HSI UK, said: "I am flabbergasted that an eight-week extension has been granted to Defra's badger killing fiasco in Gloucestershire. "By extending culls here as well as in Somerset, the pilots are moving even more dangerously away from the recommendations of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which were very clear - the longer you subject badgers to this sort of disruption, the greater the risk of worsening the spread of bovine TB among both badgers and cattle. "Surely somebody in government can put a stop to Owen Paterson's badger cull madness before it's too late?" Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said: "It goes against the advice that Defra gave to itself, that it should be a maximum of six weeks. "If they're not following their own terms of reference then that's something that is very actionable so we shall be going either for a judicial review or for an injunction." </body>

      <description>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet.</description>

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago (its distance from Earth of 30 billion light-years is because the Universe is expanding). Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its wake. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Trees reveal hidden gold deposits</title>
      <description>The detection of gold in tree leaves helps to locate deposits buried in the earth, Australian scientists find, and it could also apply to other metals.</description>

      <body>Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles in a eucalyptus tree's foliage indicates that deposits are buried many metres below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the sought-after metal in difficult-to-reach locations. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Mel Lintern, a geochemist from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: "We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia and elsewhere in the world as well. "Now we are trying to tackle finding these more difficult ones that are buried beneath tens of metres of river sediments and sand dunes. "And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this." Buried treasure Gold particles have been found around the soils of eucalyptus trees, but the researchers confirmed that the plants were taking in the element. Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to probe matter in remarkable detail - they found traces of gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amounts of the precious metal were tiny. "We've done a calculation, and found that we need 500 trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring," said Dr Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to greater riches buried more than 30m (100ft) below. Dr Lintern said: "We believe that the trees are acting like a hydraulic pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up through the vascular system into the foliage." Currently, the metal is found in outcrops, where the ore appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling. But the researchers said that analysing vegetation could offer a better method to find untapped gold deposits. Dr Lintern said: "Not only do we believe it is a way of stretching the exploration dollar further, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimises the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground." The researchers said the technique could also be used to find other minerals such as iron, copper and lead in other parts of the world. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <title>Meteorite may solve Martian mystery</title>
      <description>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say.</description>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <body>A new colony of water voles has been captured on film using hidden cameras at a canal lock in Wiltshire. Ecologists from the Canal and River Trust spotted signs of the creatures during conservation works at the Caen Hill lock flight near Devizes. Laura Plenty, from the trust, said: "We decided it was a fantastic place to test our heat and motion sensitive camera to catch them in the act." The nationally-protected species is one of the UK's fastest declining mammals. Ms Plenty said the trust had been working to create the right habitat for the creatures in an attempt to reverse the decline in the water vole population. She said they knew there were some colonies on the canal near Devizes but had not been aware of this particular colony until the recent visit to Caen Hill Lock. She said they put the camera in place after "spotting a water vole latrine which is basically a big pile of droppings". "I couldn't believe it when we captured our first footage of the water vole," Ms Plenty said. "It clearly wasn't camera shy, as we managed to get further footage, with the vole even investigating the camera and knocking it over which happily lead to some fantastic shots of water voles hauling themselves out of the water. "Viewing the footage of the vole proves that this hard work has been worthwhile. "The fact that there's a new colony of voles living on the canal is the best reward we could ask for." Water voles like to live along canals and riverbanks so they can burrow to create complicated systems of underground tunnels and nesting chambers. A survey released by the Environment Agency and wildlife trusts in September, suggested that water voles had decreased by a fifth in the UK since 2011. Reasons for the declining population include habitat loss, predation by American mink and changeable weather. </body>

      <title>Women 'better multitaskers' than men</title>
      <description>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking and employers should bear this in mind, say the authors of a new study.</description>

      <body>It is not a myth - women really are better than men at multitasking, at least in certain cases, a study says. Men were slower and less organised than women when switching rapidly between tasks in tests by UK psychologists. Both sexes struggled to cope with juggling priorities, but men suffered more on average, according to the paper in the journal BMC Psychology. It says: "The question now is why? And is it all types of multitasking or only certain situations?" The researchers hope to encourage more research on a topic which they say has attracted "astonishingly few" studies - considering how often the "women vs men" debate crops up in conversation. If men really are slower than women, it could have serious implications for how workplaces are organised, says co-author Dr Gijsbert Stoet, of the University of Glasgow. "Multitasking is getting more and more important in the office - but it's very distracting, all these gadgets interrupting our workflow. "It could be that men suffer more from this constant switching," he told BBC News. Previous studies on gender and multitasking have drawn widely different conclusions. One experiment in China found that women outperformed their male counterparts, while another in Sweden found that men may actually be better than women at multitasking when spatial tasks are involved. To settle the argument, Dr Stoet and a colleague set out to compare women and men in a certain type of multitasking; the kind we use when faced with juggling many tasks in rapid succession - but not quite simultaneously. These might include office workers who jump between incoming emails, phone calls and assignments, while running in and out of meetings. Another example might be parents in the household - cooking a meal while looking after young children and suddenly having to answer the phone. First, they compared 120 women and 120 men in a computer test which involves switching between tasks involving counting and shape-recognition. Men and women were equal when tasks were tackled one at a time. But when the tasks were mixed up there was a clear difference. Both women and men slowed down, and made more mistakes, as the switching became more rapid. But the men were significantly slower - taking 77% longer to respond, whereas women took 69% longer. "This difference may seem small, but it adds up" over a working day or week, said Dr Stoet. To make the experiment more relevant to everyday life, the researchers tried a second test. A group of women and men were given eight minutes to complete a series of tasks - locating restaurants on a map, doing simple maths problems, answering a phone call, and deciding how they would search for a lost key in a field. Completing all these assignments in eight minutes was impossible - so it forced men and women to prioritise, organise their time, and keep calm under pressure. In the key search task in particular, women displayed a clear performance advantage over men, says co-author Prof Keith Laws, of the University of Hertfordshire. "You can see from the drawings - women used methodical search patterns, like going round the field in concentric rectangles. That's a highly productive strategy for finding a lost object. "Whereas some men didn't even search the whole field in any particular manner, which is just bizarre." The reason, he observed, was that women were more organised under pressure. "They spent more time thinking at the beginning, whereas men had a slight impulsiveness, they jumped in too quickly," said Prof Laws. "It suggests that - in a stressed and complex situation - women are more able to stop and think about what's going on in front of them." Altogether, they conclude that women "have an advantage over men" in multitasking, at least in certain situations. "This suggestion does rankle a bit with men," Prof Laws explained. "Men tell me this just doesn't ring true with their experience. They regale me with stories about how the greatest pilots in the RAF are men and they have to deal with lots of different incoming information all the time. "And of course there are men who are experts. We'd never claim that all men can't multitask, or that only women can. "But we'd argue the average woman is better able to organise her time and switch between tasks than the average man. "There's no point denying these differences exist." Psychologist Dr Dongning Ren of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said the study was a useful addition to the scientific debate. "In my own research, I found similar results, so this adds support for this conclusion," she told the BBC. "Still, it is possible that for certain tasks, men might be better at multitasking. It may depend on the nature of the tasks - sequential or simultaneous." In a world where people increasingly have to multitask, we need to help individuals adapt their roles to their abilities, said Prof Laws. "Of course I don't think we should just assign women to roles where rapid switching is demanded," he explained. Instead, employers should consider assessing individuals' ability in multitasking, as some firms already do. "Because the truth is - people don't seem to be very good at assessing themselves," Prof Laws told BBC News. "Studies show that men tend to think they're better at multitasking than they are in reality, and women tend to think they're worse than they really are. "I think I am great at it, but my wife thinks I'm not." If women really are better than men, the obvious question is why? It could be that what Dr Stoet and Prof Laws observed is a learning effect - where people become expert multitaskers by practice. But there are plenty of evolutionary theories too - such as the hunter-gatherer hypothesis. This invokes a rather traditional image of women at home, cooking and tending to the infants, with men out doing so-called "linear" tasks such as chasing and killing prey. "Put simply - if women couldn't multitask, we wouldn't be here," said Dr Stoet. And interestingly - compared to our closest relatives, the apes, we are all terrible at multitasking - men and women alike. If humans have "lost" this ability during evolution, it suggests that our simple, one-track minds could actually give us an advantage, Dr Stoet explained. "Filtering out distractions helps us to achieve things we couldn't otherwise do. Like making fire," he said, offering a grain of comfort to those who find themselves on the wrong side of the divide. </body>

      <title>Exoplanet tally soars above 1,000</title>
      <description>The number of observed exoplanets - those orbiting distant stars - passes 1,000 and of these, 12 might be habitable, scientists claim.</description>

      <body>The number of observed exoplanets - worlds circling distant stars - has passed 1,000. Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>
      <description>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms.</description>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in mature woodland - and with the disease spreading inexorably - experts are looking at ways to future-proof forests. Stroll around the Woodland Trust's Hucking estate (pictured in satellite views, above) near Maidstone in Kent and you could be forgiven for thinking little has changed in centuries. Sheep graze on the swathes of grassland between the gentle chalk hills. Pockets of ancient woodland carpet the hilltops and valleys. In reality, however, this seemingly timeless rural landscape is in constant flux and the effects of ash dieback will soon be all too apparent. Trees on the estate show the hallmarks of the disease in the black, shrivelled leaves hanging from the branches of diminutive seedlings and the magnificent ash trees that tower above. Ash dieback is spreading fast in this Area of Outstanding Beauty known as the Kent Downs, with trees bearing the scars of the chalara fungus. "See that lovely big ash up there," says site manager Clive Steward, pointing out a huge tree in a patch of ancient woodland. "Underneath it - see the big wide leaves - that's sycamore. It's just waiting to take over really. Because that's what will happen." Nature is poised to fill in the gaps if - as experts predict - millions of native ash trees die. Britain's forests have been through much turmoil in modern times, from the harvesting of timber for the shipbuilding industry to the arrival of pathogens such as Dutch elm disease in the 1970s. But the current speed of change is alarming ecologists. They say trees are facing unprecedented threats, with a recent increase in findings of new pests and diseases. Many believe it is only a matter of time before threats such as the emerald ash borer beetle, which drills into the trunks of ash trees, reach our shores. In an age of global trade and travel, rather than trying to stop these invaders, the key to safeguarding forests could be to closely manage them - and plant them to be resilient to future threats, be they a new pest, a violent storm, or climate change. Austin Brady of woodland conservation charity the Woodland Trust says to give a wood resilience a range of native species need to be planted, so if a pathogen strikes, at least some of the trees will survive. "For future healthy forests we need forests to have a wider range of native species growing there, so that all our eggs aren't in one basket," says Mr Brady. "So that if a particular pest and disease or issue comes along it won't destroy the whole forest. It might take out some of the components but there'll be enough different species of trees in there for the forest to survive." Maintaining diversity in the age of trees is also important, he says, as is maintaining connections between woods to give wildlife the space to thrive. The Hucking estate is seen as a pioneer of the idea of resilient woodland. A few decades ago, before the estate was taken over by the Woodland Trust, much of it was arable farmland, dotted with patches of ancient woodland. Careful management and planning has restored the natural landscape, with new trees planted to create corridors of habitat for animals and birds to roam. A mixture of native trees were used, which stand a better chance of withstanding tree diseases that are moving around the world. Mr Brady sees the practice as trying to "mimic nature". But some believe management in this way is artificial, and that nature will find its own level. Naturalist and writer Richard Mabey argues catastrophes like tree diseases are natural events, from which woods will recover without intervention. "Woody vegetation responds, adapts, regroups," he wrote in the New Statesmen. "What emerges in its recovery stage may not be the same as before, but it will always be a vital, dynamic, arboreal community. The same process will happen with ash, perhaps more quickly than we think." Joan Weber of Forest Research, agrees that "nature will fill in the gaps," as it did when elms disappeared, but this is more difficult when one particular species is dominant in a woodland. Austin Brady, however, says Britain's countryside has lost the great, untamed forests still present in countries such as Poland, with a corresponding loss of diversity. "You could make an argument for saying, let's leave forests to nature," he says. "The trouble is - we stopped leaving forests to nature in this country about 2,000 years ago. So we can't suddenly now say let's leave them to nature... we've taken away all the support systems that nature would have had in place." Others question exactly what resilience means. Managing a wood land to guard against the effects of tree diseases will not necessarily help other wildlife in the area, says Ray Dawes of the National Trust . "If you are going to change the tree species you are going to change the wildlife," says Mr Dawes, who believes the prescription for a healthy woodland varies. The National Trust has 400 properties with significant amounts of woodland in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, and they are all different. "It's looking at individual woods - their origins, their values and the threats to them," he says. Back at the Hucking estate, Clive Steward spreads out an ordnance survey map over the bonnet of his dusty estate car to point out lanes in the Sussex and Kent weald that were carved by ancient farmers running pigs through the forests. Ash trees have left their mark on the map, recorded in names like Ashford and Asholt Wood. Local conservationists are preparing to record the impact of the ash tree on the landscape from a cultural perspective, in case it is lost. Nick Johannsen, director of the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, grew up during the era of Dutch elm disease, and remembers it well. "It's going to be a longer, slower, more lingering loss than elm was," he says. "But already beautiful ash trees are a shadow of themselves." Ash has long been part of our heritage, he says, used for the framework of early aircraft such as the De Havilland Mosquito, and tennis racquets at Wimbledon. "Not only is it extraordinary in its landscape and its wildlife importance - its natural heritage - it's also part of the cultural heritage of Britain. That's what we want to celebrate - because we are losing ash trees." </body>

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

      <description>Could Concorde ever take to the skies again?</description>

      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired, with British Airways and Airbus, which was responsible for spares and maintenance, both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns eight Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for £20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering £1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for £1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about £30m a year. That is £500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about £1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or £112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <description>How dangerous is the false widow spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <title>Canine virus threatens Siberian tiger</title>
      <description>Dog virus is latest threat to Siberian tiger</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24535799</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70502000/jpg/_70502776_z9340701-siberian_tiger_panthera_tigris_altaica_-spl.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <title>India Mars launch stokes space race</title>
      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than £55m. Now the government has spent a further £60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this £60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <description>A recycling firm is fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen".</description>

      <body>A recycling firm has been fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen". Neath Port Talbot Recycling Ltd was also ordered to pay £50,000 costs following the incident in 2011. Swansea Crown court heard a similar incident happened in 2007 and over the following years the firm had been warned about its health and safety measures. The company said it deeply regretted what happened to employee Stephen John. The court was told how the 57-year-old was asked to clean a conveyor belt which had become blocked with a sticky black substance known as flack. The company did not have any risk assessment or safe system of work for completing this task, and experienced employees like Mr John had developed their own way of cleaning the conveyor belt roller. This system of work was devised partly because the control switch was located some distance away from the actual conveyor. To clean the rollers, one employee stood by the control switch, which is out of sight from the conveyor, and a second person inserted a bar and scraped the flack from the roller. He then inserted his arm to wipe away the flack. A command was given to the switch controller and the conveyor was started and stopped quickly. The process was repeated until the roller was clean. The court heard on the day of the incident, Mr John inserted his arm and was wiping the flack away. He then passed the bar to a work colleague. The switch controller misinterpreted this as a signal and started the conveyor. Mr John's right forearm was trapped and amputated by the conveyor belt. Speaking after the hearing, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector Sarah Baldwin-Jones said the potential for greater harm or a fatal accident was also a realistic possibility. "The company failed to fully guard the conveyor around the tail end roller and this failure resulted in employees having access to dangerous parts of the machine," she said. "The risk of entrapment is well known in the industry, and this company could have taken simple steps to fit guarding. "There was also no line of sight between Mr John and the employee operating the machinery and the company failed to carry out a risk assessment when the conveyor was installed. "They also failed to devise a safe way of cleaning the rollers and to instruct employees on how to clean them safely." Neath Port Talbot Recycling of Crymlyn Burrows, Swansea, pleaded guilty to two safety breaches. Managing director Will Watson told BBC Wales the company deeply regretted what had happened and that issues at the plant had now been addressed. </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <title>Rally supports island leisure park</title>
      <description>Around 100 people stage a rally in support of plans to build an 800-lodge leisure resort on a country park.</description>

      <body>About 100 supporters of plans to build a 800-lodge leisure resort on an Anglesey country park have held a rally at Holyhead. The controversial Penrhos scheme - which developer Land and Lakes say would create up to 600 jobs - was rejected by councillors last month despite being recommended for approval by officers. It goes before councillors again next month after a "cooling off" period. Land and Lakes say they will appeal if planners do not reverse their decision. "There is high unemployment in the town and we need something," said local businessman Gwyn Pritchard. "But the way forward is for everyone to get together as you now have the supporters and objectors. "We need some kind of development here, and we need to get together to reach an agreement." Hywel Williams, who also runs a business in the town, said he was totally behind the plans. "It will bring local employment as a lot of jobs have been lost locally. "Jobs will mean people have money in their pockets which they will then spend." Under the proposals put forward by Land and Lakes, three developments would take place in the town. Penrhos coastal park would see 500 lodges and cottages built, alongside a water park, sports hall, spas, saunas and restaurants. The adjoining Cae Glas site would also be developed to create 315 more lodges. Initially, these would be used to house workers needing accommodation if a new Wylfa nuclear power station is given the go-ahead on the island. It would also be home to a hotel, football and cricket pitches and a nature reserve. A third site, on the other side of the town at Kingsland, would see 360 houses built. Again, initially they would be used to house Wylfa B workers, and those working on other parts of the Land and Lakes development, before being offered on the open market, many as affordable housing. Robert Llewelyn Jones, an Anglesey councillor in Holyhead, said he was disappointed at how the application was put together, as he said he thinks the application should be split into three - to cover the three distinct areas which are part of the plans. "I'm also concerned whether we have the infrastructure to support this many dwellings," he said. Mr Jones added: "I want jobs for Holyhead, of course I do, but I can't see that a leisure park will create 600 well-paid jobs. "Maybe some part-time jobs, but I'm a bit sceptical whether there will be anywhere near 600 jobs." The plans will come back to a further meeting of the authority because the refusal was against officers' advice. Land and Lakes, who have been working with land owners Aluminium Metals, Anglesey council and the Welsh government on the matter, said they would consider appealing if the council continued to oppose the planning application. </body>

      <body>A man who posed as a teenager on the Facebook social network in a bid to contact schoolgirls has been jailed for two-and-a-half years. Arfon Roberts-Griffiths, 34, from Llandudno in Conwy, tried to befriend about 40 girls under the age of 16. Mold Crown Court heard he engaged the girls in sexual talk and asked some to meet him, though none did. He admitted two specimen charges of inciting two girls aged 13 and 14 to indulge in sexual activity. The court was told that the defendant posed as a 17-year-old youth on Facebook and on one occasion asked a 13-year-old girl about her underwear, and that he wanted her to undress for him. Police had become aware of Roberts-Griffiths because he had on occasions been reported missing, amid concerns that he would harm himself. When arrested, he became agitated but said he was sorry and confessed to contacting girls. Gareth Roberts, defending, said that much of the prosecution case was based on the defendant's own admissions, and claimed he was a "sad and pathetic individual" rather than a "dangerous, predatory male". The judge, Mr Recorder John Philpotts, said he accepted that the defendant had not met any of the schoolgirls he contacted. "But I am satisfied that if presented with the opportunity, you would have engaged in sexual acts, including intercourse," the judge added. "The pre-sentence report says that you are a high risk of re-conviction, an imminent risk of serious harm, and that potentially could happen at any time and the impact would be serious. "I agree with that assessment." As well as being jailed, Roberts-Griffiths was ordered to register as a sex offender for life. He was also made the subject of a Sexual Offences Prevention Order, curbing his use of the internet. </body>

      <body>A father has been jailed for five years for killing his own son in a drink-fuelled row after the pair celebrated Wales' Six Nations match. Neil Davies, 53, of Llanrumney in Cardiff, stabbed son Joshua Davies, 24, in the neck with a kitchen knife following a 12-hour drinking session. Joshua's carotid artery was slashed and his jugular vein was almost severed. He was found soaked in blood on a sofa. Davies pleaded guilty at Cardiff Crown Court to manslaughter. The jury was told frantic efforts were made by police and paramedics to save Joshua. A neighbour in a nearby flat overheard Davies crying: "He's dying, what have I done, what have you done?" He rang the emergency services and said: "I just stabbed my son, please help". The court was told Davies later told police: "He is my boy - he's a boxer and gave me a black eye." Father and son had been drinking for almost 12 hours at a pub and the British Legion club in Rumney, Cardiff. They had been watching Wales beat England by a record 30-3 last March. CCTV footage at the club showed the couple pushing each other and arguing shortly before they left just after midnight to return to their flat in Llanrumney. Peter Davies, prosecuting, said Davies made no comment when he was officially interviewed by police following his arrest. Mr Davies said: "Death was caused by a single blow on the left side of the neck which penetrated between eight and 10 centimetres. "There had been friction between the two in the hours before this happened. "There had been a stand-up argument at the British Legion Club and it continued afterwards but only Neil Davies knows what happened in the flat." Tests showed both men were almost three times over the legal driving limit. David Aubrey QC, defending, said Joshua had continued with his confrontational behaviour at the flat. "He struck the defendant on the left cheek and his father was trying to calm him down," he said. "He was making sandwiches and Joshua followed him into the kitchen, The defendant had the knife in his hand preparing a meal. "He is adamant he did not deliberately arm himself with the knife but accepts he must have waved it around to ward off Joshua. "His remorse was deep and immediate. It is something he will have to live with for the rest of his life." Sentencing Davies, Recorder of Cardiff Judge Eleri Rees said the pair had a close but volatile relationship. "Both men had been drinking heavily all day and Joshua had become threatening and continued to be aggressive," she said. "The defendant acted unlawfully and recklessly in an alcohol-fuelled confrontation." Joshua's mother Karen Brady, 47, who is divorced from Davies, said: "I took great joy and pride in Joshua and his death has devastated the whole family. "His father will have to live with what he has done for the rest of his life." </body>

      <body>Boosting faith tourism in Wales will be a challenge, the Welsh government has admitted. Economy and Transport Minister Edwina Hart said attracting more visitors to places of worship and other sacred sites would give tourism a competitive edge. But she said increasing the £12m UK tourists already spend visiting faith venues would be difficult. It comes as the government launched its Faith Tourism Action Plan. Mrs Hart said the plan sets out a "challenging vision for exploiting the full potential of Wales places of worship". It said places of worship are already amongst the most visited attractions in Wales. Visit Wales figures showed tourists from across the UK spent £12m while visiting such venues in Wales in 2012. But the Welsh government said improving that figure would be hard because many places of worship are closed or appear closed to visitors; there is no coherence between faith tourism projects and no organisation adequately funded to promote it. The faith action plan, which was launched at St Asaph Cathedral in Denbighshire, is part of the government's wider tourism strategy. "This is the first action plan of its kind in the UK with a specific focus on faith tourism," Mrs Hart said. "Some of Wales' places of worship are truly iconic and attract huge numbers of visitors every year. This action plan will not only focus on the iconic sites. "Churches and chapels have a presence in every community and the activities within Wales' places of worship have helped shape its language, culture and way of life. Temples of all religions, holy sites and pilgrim trails also have their place." One element of the action plan is to develop a pilgrims' walking trail across south Wales to the cathedral. St Asaph Cathedral was chosen as the site for the launch of the action plan, which was welcomed by the Bishop of St Asaph, the Right Reverend Gregory Cameron. "Across this diocese we have holy sites and ancient places of worship which have been visited by pilgrims for generations and this initiative is a new opportunity to share our rich Christian heritage with locals and tourists alike," he said. A working group has been set up in order to achieve the objectives of the plan and their work will focus on promoting faith tourism, help tourism businesses to make the most of faith tourism. </body>

      <description>A man wrongly convicted of murdering a Cardiff newsagent launches a High Court challenge over a decision not to charge a retired police officer with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.</description>

      <body>A man wrongly convicted of murder has launched a High Court challenge over a decision not to charge a former police officer with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice. Michael O'Brien and two other men spent 11 years in jail after they were found guilty of killing Cardiff newsagent Phillip Saunders, 52, in 1987. Known as the Cardiff Newsagent Three, Mr O'Brien, Darren Hall and Ellis Sherwood, were cleared in 1999. A judgement will come at a later date. Mr O'Brien applied for judicial review of a Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decision that there was insufficient evidence to charge retired Det Insp Stuart Lewis. The application is being heard at London's High Court by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Thomas, who is sitting with Mr Justice Irwin. Lord Thomas told Heather Williams QC, appearing for Mr O'Brien: "The key issue we have to consider is whether the decision that has been made by the CPS was one no reasonable prosecutor would have reached." Ms Williams is arguing the CPS decision was "perverse" because of a failure to take into account relevant matters and a flawed information-gathering process. Lord Thomas ruled that the press and media can report the fact that Mr O'Brien's application is being made to the court, but not the details of the case. Mr Saunders died five days after being attacked and robbed close to his home in Canton, Cardiff, in October 1987. He had returned home in his van after working at his newsagent kiosk at Cardiff bus station and suffered a fractured skull. The jailing of the Cardiff Newsagent Three is regarded as one of the UK's most notorious miscarriages of justice. The judges said they would take time to consider their decision and hand down a full written judgment at a later date. Lord Thomas said people were entitled to a full account "bearing in mind this matter has been going on since 1987 and obviously caused a great deal of controversy in south Wales". </body>

      <body>A man from Bridgend who died after being found collapsed has been called a "gentle giant" who would go out of his way to help anyone who asked. The family of Kevin Hier, 50, said he was also a carer for his mother. Mr Hier was found at an address in Heol yr Ysgol, Tondu, on Wednesday and died at the Prince of Wales hospital in Bridgend. A 26-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder remains in custody at Cardiff Bay police station. In a statement his family said: "The death of Kevin has had a devastating effect on our family. "He was the most caring and affectionate man you could ever have the privilege of knowing and was regarded by many as a 'gentle giant' who would go out of his way to help anyone who asked and never had a bad streak in him." Relatives said he would be especially missed by his mother because other family members lived far away and he had "in his eyes" become her carer with daily visits and phone calls. "Many people have expressed their shock at his death and many positive comments on social websites and have left flowers and condolence messages at the scene of his death," the family statement added. "For this, we are extremely grateful and would like thank everyone for their comments and support. "We ask that all of us are left to grieve in private and try to come to terms with our loss." "If anyone wishes to send any more flowers we respectfully request that the money be donated to the ambulance service instead as they did a great job in trying to save him." Police are continuing to appeal for anyone who was in the Heol yr Ysgol area of Tondu at around 19:46 BST on Wednesday and who may have seen or heard the incident to contact the incident room on 01656 306099 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111. </body>

      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <title>Call for shorter assembly holidays</title>
      <description>Assembly members should have shorter holidays and hold an extra meeting each week, says the leader of the Welsh Conservatives.</description>

      <body>Assembly members should have shorter holidays and hold an extra meeting each week, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives says. Andrew RT Davies told BBC Wales there should be a "root and branch review" of the way the assembly operates. AMs currently hold full sessions - to question ministers and pass legislation - on a Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon. Mr Davies said an extra session could be held on Thursday mornings but the Wales Governance Centre disagrees. A recent report said proper scrutiny of the Welsh government could be achieved by increasing the number of AMs from 60 to 100. But Mr Davies said the idea of increasing the number of AMs from the current total would be "jumping the gun". He said: "Now more than ever we need a root and branch review of procedure within the Welsh parliament. "Suggestions of an increase in AM numbers are jumping the gun. "There is far more that can be done with the current number of members, and we need to get that right first." The assembly took a 10-week recess this summer and after sitting for five weeks, next week is a one-week half-term recess. Mr Davies said: "The time members spend within their constituencies and regions is extremely important and paramount to our work, while many members must also travel long distances to and from parliament. "Finding the right balance then is clearly not easy but it must be done for the benefit of Wales. "All would agree that engagement with Wales' democratic institution is worryingly low, and I hope AMs of all parties will come together to consider how we can burst the Cardiff Bay bubble." But Dr Rebecca Rumbul, manager of the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University, disagrees with Mr Davies' idea. "There are not enough AMs to properly hold the government to account currently and I don't believe that simply shortening recess or making committee members sit in yet another meeting will be a high quality solution to that problem," she said. "Most AMs you speak to will work a 60 hour week. When they're on recess, they're not on a nine-week Caribbean cruise, they are in their constituencies working very hard to the people that have voted them in. "I don't think increasing the hours will produce the kind of high quality democracy what we want. "Actually what we want to see is a plurality of voices and an increase in experience in the assembly and you can only capture that by increasing the number of AMs." </body>

      <body>Changes to improve Powys council's services will have to be made more quickly because of the latest round of funding cuts, its cabinet says. The authority will see a £9m funding cut in 2014/15 and with £11m in increased service pressures, it said it is left with a £20m funding shortfall. Four main aspects are being looked at as part of the changes. They include changing the way it delivers services, management structures, and reducing service costs. "The latest budget news with its 4.6% cut in funding shows how essential it is that the transformation continues and accelerates," leader David Jones said. "Service demands are increasing, costs are rising and our funding is falling and without change we will not deliver." He added: "This approach will ensure that we have the right services where needed, that we build a sustainable and efficient delivery network with our partners where necessary and that our citizens feel engaged in their local services." Councils the length and breadth of Wales are trying to work out the best ways of dealing with unprecedented cuts. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement earlier this month, the Welsh Local Government Association(WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. </body>

      <title>Flood risk as more rain forecast</title>
      <description>Heavy rain could lead to more localised flooding in parts of Wales over the coming days, Natural Resources Wales warns.</description>

      <body>Heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in parts of Wales over the coming days, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is warning. It follows a yellow 'be aware' alert on Friday morning for rain across much of south and south west Wales which was issued by the Met Office. NRW said the forecast for the whole of Wales remained unsettled for Sunday and Monday. Last weekend, downpours led to flash flooding in parts of Cardiff. "With ground remaining saturated from rainfall during the week, water may quickly find its way into streams, ditches and rivers with the potential for localised flooding," said a NRW spokesperson. "With leaves littering pavements and roads, there is also a risk that blocked drains will cause flooding of road surfaces, causing traffic disruption. "Officers will be monitoring river levels closely over the weekend, checking they are clear of blockages and making sure that flood defences are operating efficiently." The Met Office yellow warning for rain came into force just after midnight, and remains in place until 10:00 BST on Friday morning. It covers Cardiff, Swansea, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport, Merthyr Tydfil, Caerphilly, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Vale of Glamorgan, Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. Forecasters say nearly an inch of rain (20mm) could fall as a band of heavy cloud moves north-east across southern Wales, with over an inch of rain (30mm) on higher ground. On Saturday, flash flooding in parts of Cardiff saw police close roads around Ely and Culverhouse Cross. Shoppers at the Marks and Spencer store in Culverhouse Cross had to be evacuated when water entered the shop, but some remained stranded in the car park for up to two hours. The nearby Tesco store also had to be evacuated due to flooding. NRW urged members of the public to "keep an eye" on weather forecasts over the weekend, and check flood alerts, which are updated every 15 minutes on its website. Updates are also available on the NRW Floodline on 0845 988 1188 and through NRW's Twitter account, @natreswales. </body>

      <body>Artefacts excavated from Bute Park could help our understanding of Cardiff's role in the 16th Century, archaeologists say. Fragments of the city's burgeoning industry have been unearthed during restoration work on Mill Leat watercourse, west of Cardiff Castle. They include evidence of potteries, tanners and metallurgy. Archaeology Wales said the discoveries could shed new light on a period of Cardiff life of which little is known. The Mill Leat has been a watercourse since at least the medieval period and is believed to have powered a watermill located close to the west gate of the castle. "The subsequent industrial boom of the 18th and 19th Centuries have obliterated much of the archaeological evidence of Cardiff's roots," said Dr Amelia Pannet of Archaeology Wales. "We knew it was a reasonably significant early modern town, but these discoveries help to put it into some sort of context. "Unfortunately we won't be able to make any firm evaluations until all the artefacts we've collected have been sent away for analysis." Cardiff was a significant part of the Norman/Welsh struggle, changing hands several times between 1100 and 1300. However, by the estimated date of these artefacts it had enjoyed several hundred years of peace and prosperity. Yet despite this the 18th Century writer Iolo Morganwg, is disparaging about Cardiff's prominence, describing it as "an obscure and inconsiderable place". While this view has generally persisted, the discovery of Venetian glass, pewter spoon and clay tobacco pipe fragments possibly hint at Cardiff having played a bigger role than previously thought. Jennifer Stewart, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund in Wales, whose grant helped fund the dig, said: "These archaeological finds promise to tell us so much about how people lived and worked in the past, and hints at the international connections all those hundreds of years ago." "The rare survival of leather artefacts will be so important to tell us more about how such items were made, and how they were used." </body>

      <body>Plans to demolish the ITV Wales studios at Culverhouse Cross near Cardiff and build homes on the site have been rejected by councillors. There were proposals to build 243 new houses on the site but there were objections to the project. Vale of Glamorgan councillors narrowly rejected the application at a meeting on Thursday. ITV Wales wants to relocate to Assembly Square, next door to the Senedd building, in Cardiff Bay in 2014. The plans submitted by the broadcaster were recommended for approval by council officers, subject to a number of conditions including highway improvements and funding for schools and community facilities. But the chairman of the Vale of Glamorgan council's development committee, Councillor Frederick Johnson, has confirmed the committee narrowly rejected the application. A motion to defer the application for further talks with the developers was also rejected. Mr Johnson said he was disappointed with the outcome. "It's a sad day," he said. ITV Wales wants to relocate around 100 staff from Culverhouse Cross to Cardiff Bay by June next year. But some of the other media companies based at the Culverhouse Cross site have campaigned against the house building proposals. ITV Wales has been at Culverhouse Cross since 1984. </body>

On Thursday, following a post-mortem examination, the force said the death was not being treated as suspicious and the man had been released from custody. Supt Steve Williams said the force was "satisfied" with its actions. He said: "A review of the arrest has been conducted and we are satisfied that this was the correct course of action to take based on the circumstances that presented themselves at the time."

      <body>A main road in Snowdonia closed after a landslip covered it in about 30 tonnes of debris has reopened. The A498 was shut both ways on Wednesday between Beddgelert and Penygwryd while the carriageway was cleared. Officers used specialised equipment to remove the debris from the road, which now has temporary traffic lights in place. The landslip happened following a prolonged spell of heavy rain. A spokesman for the council said: "As part of the initial safety works on the site, concrete safety barriers are being installed. "The traffic management system will remain in place until further stabilisation work is completed at the site. "The council is currently making attempts to contact the relevant landowner before these additional safety works are carried out." The council has also spoken to the organisers of the Snowdonia Marathon, which takes place in the area on Saturday, who say the route will not be affected. </body>

      <body>A former mayor has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of explosions in Denbigh which a neighbour described as sounding like a "battlefield". John Larsen, 46, got a "thrill" from his actions, which had the potential to kill, Caernarfon Crown Court was told. The explosions happened in the Lenten Pool area from January to April. In the most serious incident, he blew up a Land Rover, showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area. Larsen was found guilty earlier on Thursday of three counts of arson, one of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and another of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said it was "a very unusual case and these are very serious offences". Larsen was mayor of Denbigh in 1999 and was a town councillor at the time of his arrest. The trial heard Lenten Pool was plagued by the sound of loud bangs, with incidents taking place two or three times a week culminating in a main attack on a Land Rover in March. Larsen was arrested by police at his nearby home on 19 April. North Wales Police found a manual on pyrotechnics in his house, a computer file named "gunpowder mix", modified fireworks and rockets, and ball-bearings. He told officers he had a legitimate interest in fireworks and had bought some materials online. But the court was told Larsen got a "thrill from what he was doing and the attention it was generating." Resident Shirley Clarke told the trial: "People often said they were fireworks - they were not fireworks. "They were humongous. They were more than fireworks, it was like a bomb." In evidence another neighbour, Trevor Jones, said the noise was like a battlefield - and the bangs and explosions became gradually louder, sounding like artillery fire. The blast under the Land Rover on 24 March showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident found that a ball-bearing had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert said the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped onto the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury or even death to any passers-by. Larsen denied the charges throughout his trial. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He said he made "fireworks, not bombs". Prior to his arrest, Larsen gave interviews to the media, including BBC Wales, saying how people were "terrified" by the "scary" the situation. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Andrew Williams said: "During this period, John Larsen came to the fore as a local leader and the community trusted him. "He betrayed that trust in a terrible way and he now faces the consequences of his actions." </body>

      <body>The former chief executive of Wrexham FC, Paul Retout, has been given a 16-month jail sentence for a £60,000 fraud. Retout, 53, admitted submitting false invoices to London-based company Quadrangle Group in 2007 and 2008 while a partner with the firm. Kingston Crown Court heard that he had started at the group in 1989 as a financial controller. He stepped down from Wrexham football club in 2010. The court was told on Thursday that Retout made claims for work he had not done, blaming his "chaotic" family life after moving to north Wales. "You were not acting dishonestly from the outset, but you became dishonest when you later invoiced and obtained money for work you had not done and for which you were not entitled, money obtained from the partnership," Judge Nicholas Jones told Retout. The judge said he also accepted that the ex-football club boss, who had his family home in Ruthin in Denbighshire, had shown remorse for his actions. Retout is also expecting to be stripped of his professional standing as a chartered accountant, the court heard. He pleaded guilty to committing fraud by abuse of position at a court hearing last month. The court was told that Retout obtained £59,806 as result of his fake invoices, and also carrying out work which had not been authorised in advance by the firm. A civil legal case with Quadrangle has been settled, and Retout has also made part-repayment of the defrauded money. </body>

      <body>The proposed merger of two Denbighshire Catholic schools could be put on hold as councillors consider a new option. It had been proposed that St Brigid's in Denbigh and Blessed Edward Jones in Rhyl should close, to be replaced by a new multi-faith school on two sites. Instead, Denbighshire councillors will be asked to consider working with the Anglican and Catholic diocese to create a single site on an undecided location. The council's cabinet will vote on the proposal at a meeting next week. More than 1,300 people responded to a consultation, which showed very little support for the original proposals. A new, single site would mean the closure of both existing faith schools, possibly by 2018. Anna Gresty, of St Brigid's Action Group, said: "Having read the council's summary of responses to this consultation, we weren't surprised at the overwhelming response against the proposals to merge St Brigid's School and Blessed Edward Jones as one school 12 miles apart." Tony Hannigan, chair of governors at St Brigid's School, said: "St Brigid's School is very pleased to have been told in a meeting with Denbighshire County Council officers, that they have listened to our concerns and will recommend councillors drop plans for a 'one school on two sites' model involving St Brigid's and Blessed Edward Jones in 2014." However, he said there was concern that plans to build a new school, adding that it would "represent much greater value for money for the taxpayer to use the existing sites and build on their successes". Earlier this year, pupils at St Brigid's made on online film to campaign to keep the school as it is. </body>

      <body>A health trust has admitted failings in the care of an 18-year-old Kent student with a history of mental health problems who killed herself. Lauren Smith, of Canterbury, was found dead at the University in Wales Trinity St David's Lampeter campus in 2012. Her mother, Laura Smith, said she had been left "heartbroken" and did not want the situation to be repeated. Kent and Medway NHS Trust said a review found "more could have been done" to support her transfer to Wales. Lauren, who had a history of self-harming, was weeks into the first year of her humanities degree when she took her own life at the university halls of residence in Lampeter on 17 November 2012. Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton recorded a verdict of suicide while suffering severe depressive illness, at an inquest into her death in Aberystwyth. The inquest was told she was not getting the mental health care she should have been receiving. Ms Smith said there was a lack of support for teenagers with a history of mental health and they were at risk of "slipping through the cracks" when they turned 18, left home or moved to university. She added: "I was given a false sense of security by assuming risk assessments were being carried out, that my concerns as her mother were being recorded, and that information and records were being shared between agencies. "There seems to be complacency among mental health professionals when it comes to adolescent mental health - for instance, I was told by one hospital psychiatrist that lots of teenage girls harm themselves, it doesn't mean they're going to do anything." She added: "There were many opportunities for the outcome to have been different for Lauren. "We will never know this for sure, but I hope that other vulnerable young people and their families can be spared the additional agony of what ifs? by ensuring that further deaths of those slipping through the cracks - as they transition between Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Adult Services - are prevented." A spokeswoman for Kent and Medway NHS Trust said: "Following Lauren's death the trust conducted an immediate review of the care provided. The initial investigation concluded that record-keeping in the case was below the expected standard and the arrangements for transferring care to Wales should have been better managed. "Further review has highlighted that more could have been done to gather information from other mental health services that had seen Lauren in the past." In a statement, Hywel Dda Health Board said it had contacted Ms Smith's family "to explain that the appropriate referral to local mental health services was made for Lauren whilst she was resident in our area". A spokesman for the University in Wales Trinity St David said it had a comprehensive range of support services for students in place, which included mental health advisers, mentors and counsellors. "These services are provided as soon as the university is made aware of any support needs that our students might have," he said. He added that the university students' union also provided a student welfare service and a night-time listening service. </body>

      <body>Villagers are concerned a planned pylon route linking wind farms to the national power supply could spoil the view from a local hill. Drop-in sessions are being staged by National Grid over the 25-mile (40km) route in Powys and Shropshire until 8 November. In Llanymynech, near Welshpool, people said they feared the pylons could ruin the views across the two counties. National Grid said it was "one of the main things" concerning people. A spokeswoman said National Grid "fully understands" people's concerns in Llanymynech, adding: "That's why we're holding these events, to hear people's opinions." The pylon route would start from an electricity sub-station in Cefn Coch, near Llanfair Caereinion, and finish at the national transmission network near Oswestry in Shropshire. In addition to the pylons, National Grid has said eight miles (nearly 13km) of cables will be buried underground in the Meifod valley. The first of 26 drop-in sessions in Powys and Shropshire started on 7 October. Revealing its pylon plans in September, National Grid said a new "T-pylon" - which is about 15m (nearly 50ft) shorter than conventional pylons - could be used along the power cable route which would be 33 miles (53km) long. It said it had developed a draft route to keep away from villages and would use "hills and trees as a natural backdrop to help keep any visual impact to a minimum". The remaining drop-in sessions start next week at West Felton Village Hall, near Oswestry, and at Meifod Village Hall, near Welshpool. </body>

      <body>Police have ended their search for a man who sexually assaulted three girls in the pool of Swansea's main leisure centre. The girls - aged eight, nine and 15 - were targeted by a man in the LC in Oystermouth Road on 21 August. The centre was closed for a short time following the incident while police searched the premises, and detectives at South Wales Police have since studied CCTV footage. Officers said nobody had been found. "Despite an extensive investigation into allegations of indecent behaviour at the LC in Swansea in August, no culprit has been identified and in the absence of any new information the matter has been finalised," a spokesperson said. Nic Beggs, general manager of the LC, said extra CCTV had been installed since the incident and staff had received extra training from the police. He added: "We have been working closely with the police since this incident took place and we are clearly disappointed no one has been apprehended. "We take a zero tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour and have made a number of improvements in recent months to increase customer safety." Officers described the suspect as tanned with collar-length brown hair, unshaven, and wearing black or blue knee-length board shorts. Anyone with any information should call Swansea Central CID on 01792 450618 or 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. </body>

      <body>Manager Michael Laudrup said Swansea's draw with Kuban Krasnodar was a fair result, despite the frustration of seeing his side concede a last-minute equaliser. Michu gave the Swans the lead before Djibril Cisse's penalty made it 1-1. The result meant Swansea dropped points for the first time in their debut Europa League campaign. "If you look at the game overall, I have to admit the draw was a fair result," said Laudrup Swansea remain top of Group A, one point ahead of Valencia with three games remaining. Laudrup has stated he believes 10 or 11 points will ensure they qualify for the knockout stages. The Dane conceded he was frustrated by his side's inability to hold on for maximum points but praised the Russians' performance. "When you are 1-0 up in injury-time and you have the ball, you think it's done," said Laudrup. "If you look at the way we conceded the goal - a penalty after a counter-attack in injury-time - it is frustrating. "We had a lot of possession, like we do, but we did not create that many chances. They were very dangerous on the counter-attack, which we knew before the game. "In the first half, they had three or four very dangerous counter-attacks. So overall a draw is fair." Laudrup refused to blame any of his players for the penalty, despite Jonjo Shelvey losing the ball in midfield and goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel bringing down substitute Ibrahima Balde for the spot-kick. "We don't point fingers at anybody here," said Laudrup. "We are still learning and very few of my players have played international games. "Yes, we play in the Premier League but this is a process and I think this will give us a lot of experience. To get experience you have to make mistakes, but you learn from them." </body>

      <title>Parents urged to act over measles</title>
      <description>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading.</description>

      <body>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of cases linked to a Pontardawe school had risen to 13, while a case had been reported at a Swansea nursery. This outbreak comes less than four months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended - centred on the same area with 1,200 suspected cases. PHW said it was "very frustrated". "We now have cases not only in Cwmtawe school but also in two primary schools, a further education college and a nursery," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, PHW's consultant in communicable disease control. "In all of these places there are unvaccinated children and young people who could easily catch and spread measles." Health officials have already written to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated. Pupils were offered the MMR vaccination with 55 children immunised during the school session but at least 46 did not take up the offer. Dr Hoffmann added: "We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year. "We are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. "The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine." The Swansea area epidemic lasted eight months with suspected cases first reported in November 12. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash. </body>

      <body>Police are hunting a man who sexually assaulted a teenage girl in a daylight attack as she walked through a park. The attack happened next to a golf club at Bryn Bach Park, Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, between 13:30 BST and 16:00 BST on Monday. The 16-year-old girl was walking past the club with a friend when a man rode up on a bike, assaulted her and rode off. A Gwent Police spokesman said he was in his 30s with prominent black eyebrows. The girl described him as dressed in black and having a partially covered face. "He was wearing an army camouflage print snood covering the bottom half of his face and a black hat/hood on his head which still exposed prominent black eyebrows," Gwent Police said. "He was also wearing a black raincoat, black trousers and black shoes." </body>

      <title>Pulis keen to return to management</title>
      <description>Former Stoke boss Tony Pulis, favourite to replace Ian Holloway at Crystal Palace, would like to return to management.</description>

      <body>Crystal Palace target Tony Pulis admits he is keen to return to management but insists "the job has to be right." Pulis, 55, established Stoke in the top flight before leaving in May and is favourite to replace Ian Holloway, who left by mutual consent on Wednesday. "It was important to take a rest," Pulis told BBC Sport. "I'm really pleased I've had contact from other clubs but they didn't feel right." Palace are 19th in the Premier League and host leaders Arsenal on Saturday. Chairman Steve Parish said he is planning to approach Pulis. "He's never been relegated and he's out of work. We'll look," he said. Pulis was appointed Stoke boss for a second time in 2006 and two years later guided them into the Premier League after a 23-year absence. Despite not finishing lower than 14th in five seasons in the Premier League, the Welshman left by mutual consent in the summer after being told the club felt the time was right for him to leave. He has said he will consider roles in the Championship. Stoke's direct and physical style of football often drew criticism from other supporters and managers. "I'm sure we'll try and contact him and if he's interested we'll have a chat with him and see where we go," Parish told talkSPORT.  "But I don't want to put pressure on anybody. We've started making a list, we'll throw everybody into that and see who we want to see." If Pulis does take charge at Palace, he will replace a man the south London club did not want to lose. "I was more than happy to get relegated and come back up with Ian," Parish said. "The word 'sacked' has never been mentioned among the directors. "I wanted Ian to wake up and say 'sorry about the blip' and stay." Holloway, 50, guided Palace to the Premier League via the play-offs last season after joining in November, and signed 16 players in the summer. But the only points his squad were able to gain in eight league matches this term came in the 3-1 victory against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 31 August. "All I can do is be as honest as I can and wish everyone at the club well," the former Blackpool manager said. "I need a little bit of time to chill out with the family, but I will look out for Palace's scores." </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <title>Extra funding for Wales from HS2</title>
      <description>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury concedes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-24648153</url>

      <body>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury has conceded. It had initially rejected Finance Minister Jane Hutt's announcement that Wales would get extra cash stemming from spending on the project in 2015. The Welsh government said it was "pleased the position is now clear". But the spending commitment of around £35m in that year is not guaranteed for the lifetime of the project. The Treasury suggested it may change the funding formula in the future. HS2 is a controversial new high speed rail link proposed to run from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033, at an estimated cost of £42.5bn. UK government ministers have always maintained that the project is of UK-wide significance. This would mean the devolved nations should not get extra payments which are normally due to them for transport projects in England. The 2015 extra cash will put pressure on the Treasury to maintain the payments throughout the next decade - which could bring in up to £2bn for the Welsh budget. But the Chancellor is able to change the funding formula at his discretion, which means that in future years the system could be adjusted to exclude any additional cash for Wales. The Welsh government is likely to campaign strongly to continue to receive the extra funding beyond 2015. It confirmed it had received a share of £832m to be spent on the HS2 scheme by the Department for Transport in 2015-16. Speaking to BBC Wales on Thursday, Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the Welsh government was "very clear" on the matter. She said that this episode demonstrated how the way the Welsh government is funded "needs reform". The Welsh government receives a slice of the extra money that is spent in England on services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, what is known as "Barnett consequentials". That process would normally include transport spending, but Treasury officials had always maintained Wales would not get more cash as a result of extra spending on HS2 because they say the project benefits the entire UK. The issue of Wales receiving part of this money has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee on Monday - where she informed members of the extra cash coming to Wales - was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. She told AMs there would be £84m extra in 2015-16, because of a £2bn increase in the Department for Transport's overall budget, which includes £832m spent on HS2. A Treasury spokesperson said the Welsh government had received a "capital consequential" of £84.5m. "This was based on a £2bn increase in the total Department for Transport capital budget," said the Treasury. Figures obtained by the BBC under a freedom of information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <title>Firms still failing over 'swaps'</title>
      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people attended a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed £180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <body>Toby Faletau could be a doubt for Wales' autumn campaign after suffering a neck injury on Friday night. The Newport Gwent Dragons number eight was hurt tackling Ospreys wing Eli Walker in his region's defeat at the Liberty Stadium. The game was stopped for close to 10 minutes while Faletau was placed in a neck brace before being carried off. Early indications are the treatment was precautionary but a hospital scan is expected to reveal more. British and Irish Lions star Faletau would be a major loss for Wales as they prepare to face South Africa on 9 November, before matches against Argentina, Tonga and Australia on successive weekends. Ryan Jones is the only other specialist number eight in Warren Gatland's squad, although Faletau's regional team-mate Andrew Coombs and former Dragon Dan Lydiate - now at Racing Metro - could fill in there. Gatland also has the option of calling up a replacement to his squad if it is deemed necessary. </body>

      <description>Manager Malky Mackay dismisses Jose Mourinho's accusation that Cardiff City employed time-wasting tactics against Chelsea.</description>

      <body>Cardiff City manager Malky Mackay has dismissed Jose Mourinho's accusation of time wasting in the 4-1 defeat by Chelsea. Blues boss Mourinho was sent to the stands and fined £8,000 by the Football Association for "improper conduct". "I remember watching Porto play Celtic in the Uefa Cup final a long time ago and that allegation was labelled at him by Martin O'Neill," said Mackay. "It is just something that is borne out of frustration at being sent off." Mackay said he has not been concerned by Mourinho's comments about Cardiff. He was also happy to remind the media of the 2003 Uefa Cup final when Porto were accused of time wasting by then-Celtic manager O'Neill. At the time O'Neill had said of Mourinho's team: "I will probably get into trouble for this, but it was poor sportsmanship. The rolling over, the time wasting." And Mackay believes the amount of added time at the end of the second half at Stamford Bridge backs his claim that Mourinho's accusation was unfounded. "It doesn't really bother me in the slightest," said Mackay. "I think when you look at four minutes stoppage time being held up, nowadays that is a pretty normal standard amount of time in the second half." Cardiff are away to Norwich City on Saturday with former Canaries stalwart Mackay focusing on the task of picking up an important three points. "I was very very happy with the performance of a lot of my players against a team [Chelsea] who are going to be challenging for the Premier League title," he said. "Now we face a side who I think have got experience throughout their team. "They have invested again and there are guys who have played together for many years. "I think the atmosphere, the tight pitch, always make for a tough game at Carrow Road. I have never had an easy one and that included when I played there." </body>

      <description>Acting, not singing, role of Britain's Got Talent winner</description>

      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the microphone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it, seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <title>'Spare cash' hope low in Wales</title>
      <description>Low expectations of spare cash despite growth boost for firms</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24679723</url>

      <body>A poll for BBC Wales shows only one out of seven people questioned expect to have more spare cash in two years time. The results come despite the fact that the UK economy has been growing for nine months. New figures show GDP (Gross Domestic Product) increased by 0.8% between June and September, the biggest rise for three years. That trend may need to continue well into next year before people in Wales generally begin to experience recovery. Today's GDP figures are good news for both the UK and Wales. What is interesting is that the growth is across all industrial categories. Agriculture has grown 1.4%, construction by 2.5%, services by 0.7% and production by 0.5%. When you look at the parts that make up the production sector manufacturing has grown by 0.9% and that is a sector that is more significant in Wales than the UK as a whole. In the UK manufacturing accounts for 11% of the economy whereas in Wales it accounts for 17%. In fact, of the countries in the UK, Wales has the largest proportion of its economy taken up by manufacturing. The construction growth that is shown in today's GDP figures has been helped by an increase in spending on private housing and private commercial properties. At the D and M foundry on the Pant Industrial estate in Merthyr Tydfil the 25 employees are working overtime again. The privately owned firm, struggled to survive the recession five years ago. It shed workers but has now taken people on and they are working flat out. Owner and managing director Phil Corke says they have been helped by increased spending by shoppers and businesses in the south east of England. He says that half of their turnover is now on work from that area. They make display shelving for most supermarkets as well as ornamental fencing for public buildings and structures for road building. Mr Corke says the company has seen a pick-up in orders from Wales and in the construction sector because of investment in roads by the Welsh government. He says the fact that they work for many different clients across various sectors makes their income more resilient. D and M's production manager Simon Griffiths says what is also vital is that the work is delivered on time to the client at the right price. He says a company of D and M's size is well placed to be flexible enough to satisfy clients' requests. Phil Corke says the one factor that is holding the company back is a shortage of skilled welders. He says two employees have recently been, in effect, poached by other companies and he says he thinks similar skills shortages could weaken Wales' economic recovery. However, a poll by ICM research for BBC Wales shows that 6 out of 7 people questioned do not expect to have more money in two years time once they've paid essential bills. The poll also found that while 58% of the 750 people questioned were confident that Wales would benefit if the UK economy became stronger, 37% didn't. Men were found to be more optimistic than women. </body>

      <body>The adult-themed crime game, Grand Theft Auto 5, has won the top prize at the Golden Joystick awards. Rockstar's controversial game - where players commit crime in the fictional city of Los Santos - was presented with the Game of the Year gong at a ceremony in central London. Sony's The Last of Us also scooped two awards. Ken Levine - the man behind Bioshock and System Shock 2 - was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. The Golden Joysticks are the largest publicly-voted video game awards in the world, with this year more than 10 million people casting a vote. The Lifetime Achievement is a new addition to the ceremony. Mr Levine has been a high profile figure in the industry ever since he worked with designer Doug Church, on the first-person shooter, Thief: The Dark Project, credited with being one of the first titles to introduce the concept of stealth into video games. "The great thing about the still-maturing nature of video games is you get to be inspired by the work of novices and veterans alike," he said. "We're all figuring out day by day exactly what the medium is capable of." Now in its 31st year, the awards were first given out back in 1983, with the first Game of the Year award going to Jet Pac on the ZX Spectrum. Andy Robinson, editor of Computer and Videogames, said that three decades on, the awards still "represent the voice of gamers worldwide". "We've revamped the categories to reflect the diversity of modern gaming and also added the inaugural Lifetime Achievement award, which has made this year's ceremony the most thrilling for us yet," he said. The Golden Joysticks are not the only big awards for the video games industry. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts hands out its Video Game Baftas in the spring each year, although the majority of their awards are selected by a panel of experts, rather than a public vote. Grand Theft Auto 5, released last month, quickly became the fastest selling entertainment product ever, taking just three days to generate $1bn (£620m) in revenue. </body>

      <body>Wikipedia has begun piloting a service that sends articles via text message, primarily aimed at users in Africa. The online encyclopaedia has partnered with mobile operator Airtel to offer the free initiative which is being tested out in Kenya. It is hoped the service will be used to reach people who do not have internet access. The trial will be active for three months, said Dan Foy, technical partner manager for the Wikimedia Foundation. "Throughout most of the developing world, data-enabled smartphones are the exception, not the rule," he wrote. "That means billions of people currently cannot see Wikipedia on their phones." To activate the service - called Wikipedia Zero - users need to dial *515#, after which they will receive a text message prompting them to search for articles. Adoption of cheap mobiles in Africa is widespread, and in many regards the mobile industry across the continent is more advanced than in more developed parts of the world. For instance, the sending of money via text message is extremely popular - one service, M-Pesa, boasts 17 million users in Kenya alone. Western technology companies see the region as a major source of future growth. Facebook, for example, is approaching saturation point in its current markets, and so it is looking at methods to adapt its services to suit those with more basic technology. The social network also launched a drive to get other technology companies looking at ways to make access easier - starting with bringing down costs of accessing mobile data. Tom Jackson, who edits African technology news website HumanIPO, said Wikipedia's initiative would be warmly welcomed. "There has been a steady move towards putting educational material online in many African countries, led mainly by the private sector rather than governments, but access to the internet remains a problem given that most Africans surf on their phones rather than browsers. "This step increases the chances of access, especially as there is functionality to provide Wikipedia via SMS. Feature phones are still dominant in Africa, so this is a helpful addition." He added: "I just hope it comes with the same warnings that European and American kids are given about taking Wikipedia at face value!" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>FBI on the hunt for eBay 'fraudster'</title>
      <description>The FBI has issued a wanted poster for a Romanian fraudster accused of being behind a multi-million dollar cybercrime ring.</description>

      <body>The FBI has issued wanted posters for a man they say is behind an eBay car scam that has netted $3m (£1.8m). Authorities in the US also want to track down six other fugitives in relation to the charges. The gang were described as "masters of illusion" who convinced people to pay for cars that did not exist. "They thought their distance would insulate them from law enforcement scrutiny. They were wrong," said US attorney Loretta Lynch. The FBI put out a wanted poster for 33-year-old Romanian Nicolae Popescu, charging him with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. "They siphoned funds from victims to fuel their greedy desires and created false identities, fake websites and counterfeit certificates of title in order to make the scheme more convincing," said FBI Assistant Director, George Venizelos. "Popescu and his co-conspirators were masters of illusion, but they can't escape their ultimate reality. "With the help of our law enforcement partners at home and abroad, we will bring them to justice." In a statement, eBay said: "We have partnered with law enforcement to alert consumers about the type of scams described in the indictment - which involve exploiting well-known, trusted brand names like eBay to attract consumers and then lure them onto fake websites and into fraudulent transactions. "Auto shoppers can be confident in their purchase by ensuring they start and complete their transactions on eBay Motors and never use money wire services to send payments." In a recorded conversation, the FBI said Mr Popescu boasted that he was "beyond the reach" of US authorities. As well as eBay, the gang is said to have used Cars.com, AutoTrader.com, and CycleTrader.com to sell the non-existent cars, usually priced between $10,000 (£6,150) and $40,000 (£24,700). "After the 'sellers' reached an agreement with the victim buyers, they would often email them invoices purporting to be from Amazon Payments, PayPal, or other online payment services, with instructions to transfer the money to the US bank accounts used by the defendants," an FBI statement explained. Romania has gained increasing notoriety as a hub for cybercrime. A report from technology magazine Wired detailed a town dubbed "Hackerville" by locals - where cybercriminals are said to learn their craft at an early age. </body>

      <title>Twitter float could raise $1.4bn</title>
      <description>Twitter says it will sell 70 million shares priced between $17 (£10.50) and $20, valuing the microblogging site at as much as $11bn.</description>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <title>MEPs vote to suspend US data sharing</title>
      <description>A non-binding vote in the EU represents growing unease about the amount of data Europe has shared with the US.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>3D printer 'gun parts' found in raid</title>
      <description>Greater Manchester Police say they "cannot categorically" state whether items seized in a raid are actually gun parts made by a 3D printer.</description>

      <body>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined. Officers initially thought they could be a "plastic magazine and trigger" which would make a "viable" gun. But a man who was arrested in connection with the raid said the parts were sections of the 3D printer. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has now said it "cannot categorically say" whether the objects are the component parts for a gun. The arrested man, who has since been bailed, said: "It's nothing to do with a gun whatsoever. "I have no idea why they think it is part of a gun. It's designed by the company that makes the printer to go in the printer to make it better." The component suspected as being a magazine for a gun was in fact a "spool holder" for the 3D printer, he added. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. The equipment was seized during a series of raids targeting organised crime. A force spokesman earlier said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". But experts have cast doubt on whether the printer was sophisticated enough to print gun components. Brian Derby, professor of material science at University of Manchester, said the seized printer appeared to be a hobbyist's machine. He said: "It would make something that would look like a gun but it would not work as a gun." Asst Ch Con Steve Heywood said: "We need to be absolutely clear that at that this stage, we cannot categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3D gun. "What we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine, viable firearm." He added: "Clearly the fact we have seized a 3D printer and have intelligence about the possible production of a weapon using this technology is of concern. It is prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat." The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said the manufacture of guns through 3D printing was "almost inevitable" because of the relatively few firearms in circulation. "The worst-case-scenario would be a cheap and 100% reliable device that could be made overnight and then destroyed after just one use, disposing of crucial evidence to pin to a suspect," he added. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the High Street for less than £1,000, but prices more complex models can cost £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. The group that created the firearm, Defense Distributed, said it planned to make the blueprints available online. Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas, who defended making the design available by saying: "I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. "It's not up to the political players anymore." At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, saw its losses narrow in the third quarter as its sales grew more than expected. It reported a net loss of $41m (£25m) for the July-September period. That is down from $274m a year earlier. The firm said that its sales surged 24% from a year ago to $17.1bn. The firm forecast its sales would grow further in the current quarter. That saw its shares rise by as much as 9.6% in after-hours trading in New York. RJ Jottovy, an analyst with Morningstar, said that "it looks like the revenue momentum will continue into the fourth quarter" despite the macro business environment being tough. Amazon said it expects fourth-quarter sales of $23.5bn to $26.5bn. Analysts had forecast revenue of $25.9bn. This is the third quarter in a row that Amazon has posted a net loss. However, the firm has been taking steps to try to turn around its fortunes. This includes expanding its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets and boosting its delivery network and cloud-computing services. The company has also been building more warehouses to reduce shipping costs and is adding robots to increase its efficiency in delivering orders. Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement that ''it's been a busy few months" for the company. At the same time some of the services being offered by the firm have also helped to attract consumers. Mr Bezos added that one Amazon service called Prime had signed up "millions" of new members. The service offers free two-day shipping for eligible purchases. Members also get access to Amazon Instant Video and have the ability to borrow books from other Kindle owners. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has reported a 26% jump in profit in the third quarter driven by strong smartphone sales and a recovery in its memory chip business. It made a net profit of 8.24 trillion won ($7.6bn; £4.7bn) in the July-to-September quarter, up from 6.56tn won during the same period a year earlier. Operating profit rose to a record 10.2 trillion won during the quarter. The firm said sales of smartphones, a key driver of its growth, are expected to rise further in coming months. It said that sales "will gain momentum due to year-end promotions over the holiday season and an improved line-up of mass-market smartphones". Samsung has posted record operating profit in six of the past seven quarters, mostly due to the growth of its smartphone division. The firm has enjoyed success in both the top-end as well as lower end of the smartphone market, giving it an edge over rivals such as Apple which makes only top-end phones. Its growth in the sector has seen it become the world's biggest smartphone maker. However, there have been concerns over whether Samsung can continue to grow at such a strong pace, not least because of increased competition and saturation of some key markets. "Samsung has done well, having rapidly caught up with Apple in the smartphone market. But I'm concerned whether Samsung would be able to do better," said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. "Like Nokia, Samsung may hit a limit in increasing market share. Apple is also fighting back, signalling an uphill battle for Samsung." Analysts said that the company needed to come up with more innovative products to help sustain its growth rate. For its part, Samsung has been taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, it launched a smartphone with a curved display screen, beating its rival LG by at least a few months to offer a handset featuring flexible-screen tech. In September, it unveiled a smartwatch with a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps. Again, it edged firms such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to unveil such a device. Samsung's latest earnings were also boosted by its semiconductor business, which saw profit more than double to 2.1tn won, the highest in three years. Revenues in the division rose 12% over the previous quarter to 9.74tn won. The firm saw its bottom line buoyed by stronger chip prices after a fire at a plant owned by rival SK Hynix caused tightened supply in the market. Samsung supplies chips to other smartphone-makers, including its biggest competitor Apple, and expects demand to pick up as the year draws to a close. However, its consumer electronics division, which includes TV manufacturing, saw a decline in profit due to a drop in demand in China and Europe. But Samsung said that it expects the unit to bounce back in the current quarter, not least due to holiday season shopping during the end of the year. </body>

"Our devices and services transformation is progressing," said boss Steve Ballmer in a statement. He added that Microsoft is launching a "wide range" of new products in the coming quarter. The report shed no light on who is to replace Mr Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within the next year. The company has released several new products this quarter, including an update to Windows 8, and recently bought the mobile phone unit of struggling Finnish giant Nokia. Shares rose 6% in after hours trading on the strong results. For the first time, Microsoft also announced sales of its tablet computer, Surface. It said revenues from Surface "grew to $400 million with sequential growth in revenue and units sold over the prior quarter". Last quarter, the company was forced to take an embarrassing write down of $900m after sluggish sales. The computer, well-liked by reviewers, marked Microsoft's first foray into hardware manufacturing. However consumers, many of whom expressed displeasure at Microsoft's update to its popular operating system Windows, did not bite. The company still did not provide sales figures of the device. Investors hoping for any information about who will replace Mr Ballmer in the new year were disappointed. Earlier today, on a conference call to discuss earnings, Ford boss Alan Mullaly declined to comment on rumours that he was being considered for the top job. Other contenders include Stephen Elop, the former head of Nokia, who resigned as boss after Microsoft announced it would purchase the Nokia's mobile phone unit for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) in September. Mr Elop is now head of Devices and Services at Nokia, although he is expected to transfer to Microsoft - where he was once a top manager - once the deal is completed. Mr Ballmer has been at the helm of Microsoft since 2000, and has been at the company since 1980. </body>

      <title>Ofcom reveals state of UK broadband</title>
      <description>Ofcom's annual report reveals that while some UK roads are 3G notspots, superfast broadband is now available for the majority of homes.</description>

      <body>While superfast broadband is now available to almost three quarters of UK homes, getting a connection on Britain's roads is more tricky, according to a report from Ofcom. Its annual infrastructure report looked at mobile coverage on roads for the first time. While motorways have good 3G coverage, just 35% of the UK's A and B roads are served by all four mobile networks. The report found that 9% of roads have no 3G coverage at all. The latest trends in mobile and broadband outlined by the report are designed to give a snapshot of the UK's communications market. Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of superfast speeds, defined by the watchdog as 30Mbps (megabits per second) or above. That equates to 22% of connections, up from 10% last year. There are several reasons why consumers may be reluctant to upgrade, thinks Andrew Ferguson from broadband news site ThinkBroadband. "The usual factors we encounter from consumers are resistance to any increase in price, and the £10 to £20 premium for faster services can deter many, particularly if paying under £10 for their broadband service now," he said. "There are also a good number who after not getting speeds close to the advertised speeds previously are wary of upgrading for little or no benefit," he added. The appetite for data is huge though - Britons use 650 million gigabytes in an average month, equivalent to more than one billion copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, according to the report. Ofcom believes that there are two main factors contributing to this deluge of data - the fact that many households have lots of devices wanting to connect to the internet and the need for high-quality on-demand TV services. Outside the home, people are also demanding more connectivity. According to the report the number of public wi-fi hotspots in the UK has doubled from 16,000 to 34,000 over the last year. The amount of data being sent or received from these hotspots has almost trebled, to almost 2 million gigabytes a month. Meanwhile 4G services continue to be rolled out by the UK's mobile operators. As well as looking at coverage on the UK's roads, Ofcom is also looking at 3G services on railways although the results will not be released until next year. "We know consumers increasingly expect superfast speeds, but it is also important to make sure people can connect over a very wide area. That is why we are doing everything we can to support moves to improve coverage in difficult areas such as roads and train lines," said Ed Richards, Ofcom's chief executive. </body>

      <title>Coated silicon to boost battery life</title>
      <description>Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors.</description>

      <body>Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors. Created by American scientists, the components exploit properties of carefully engineered silicon slices to hold and quickly deliver a charge. Renewable energy sources could also benefit from the work on the cheaper super-capacitors. The silicon components should be easy to add to existing chip-production systems, said the researchers. Super-capacitors built from carbon are already used as energy storage systems in electric vehicles and in wind turbines to ensure blades turn smoothly, but their bulk and cost have limited them to these niche applications. Scientists in the engineering department at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee tested different materials to see if they could be used to reduce the cost and size of these super-capacitors. Silicon became a good candidate when the Vanderbilt team found a way to apply a coat of graphene that was only a few nanometres thick. This coating was needed to stop the silicon reacting with the chemicals that provide the ions used to store an electrical charge. The team, headed by engineering professor Cary Pint, used porous silicon in their research because the method of etching billions of tiny pits on to the material is well established. All those nano-scale features give the material a huge surface area relative to its size and help it store a significant electrical charge. Writing in a paper in the journal Nature, the scientists explained how the coating bestowed on the silicon properties similar to those seen in commercial super-capacitors. It allows them to dispense their stored power quickly and last much longer than current re-chargeable batteries. The team is now looking into ways to integrate the coated silicon into existing manufacturing processes so the super-capacitors can be more widely used in gadgets such as phones. One of the first applications of the work could be as a storage system for solar power plants. Super-capacitors on the rear of solar cells could store power as it is collected and then dispense it during the night when demand grows. "All the things that define us in a modern environment require electricity," said Prof Pint. "The more that we can integrate power storage into existing materials and devices, the more compact and efficient they will become." </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; £210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <title>BT told to change 'misleading' TV ad</title>
      <description>A BT TV advert has been called "misleading" by the ASA over claims it made about what can interfere with wi-fi signals.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has told BT to change a TV advertisement, following complaints about claims it made about wi-fi interference. In the advert, BT said its new Home Hub could handle interference caused by gadgets that use the same radio spectrum as wi-fi. The ad showed gadgets such as mobile phones and radios, wrongly suggesting they could slow wi-fi speeds. BT said it would review its ad approval process in the wake of the ruling. The ASA said the advert was misleading because of the prominence it gave to devices, such as phones and radios, that did not interfere with wi-fi signals. In its judgement, the ASA acknowledged evidence cited by BT suggesting some non-wi-fi devices, such as baby monitors and video senders, could interfere with wi-fi but said these did not feature significantly enough in the advert. "We considered that the inclusion of images of mobile phones and radios implied that consumers who had those items in their homes may experience problems due to interference when we had not seen any evidence to that effect," it said. The ASA has told BT that the advert must not be broadcast in its current form. In an official statement , BT said the ASA had agreed that some household devices could interfere with wi-fi but conceded the watchdog's point that such devices had not featured enough in the advert. "We are reviewing our legal sign-off processes to ensure that creative visuals accurately reflect our substantiation in future TV ads," it added. </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635498</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70652000/jpg/_70652651_fb.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <body>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) is expected to roll out the new names within weeks. They are: شبكة, the Arabic word for "web"; 游戏, the Chinese word for "game"; and the Russian words for "online" and "web site", онлайн and сайт. Icann hopes hundreds of new top-level domains will eventually be made. Until now, generic top-level domains (gTLDS) - as they are known - were limited to mostly familiar endings such as .com, .net and .biz. But Icann has decided to open this system up, inviting companies to submit applications for names they would like to register. Firms came forward to request almost 2,000 new names including the likes of .porn, .ninja, and .ferrari. The BBC expressed an interest in .bbc. Google made 101 requests, including .google and .youtube, and also had more unexpected ideas such as .and, .boo, .dad and .new. It will take some time for Icann to process all of those requests, particularly in cases where more than one firm wants to own the same gTLD - such as .music, requested by both Amazon and Google. The most popular domain name was .app - with 13 different companies interested in it. Wednesday's announcement marks the first set of domains in the new system to be approved. "You'll note that all four of these new strings are Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)," said Christine Willett, vice president of the gTLD program, in a blog post. "This will be the first time non-Latin characters can be used in a generic TLD." She added: "The move is an effort to create a more inclusive internet." The new domains will now "proceed to delegation", the final stage before being made live - expected to happen within the next couple of weeks. </body>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when a restoration project finishes next year. The Bletchley Park Trust hopes annual visitor numbers to the site near Milton Keynes will rise to 250,000. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park, which is currently open to visitors with tours and a museum, was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to complete the work in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>A senior White House official has been sacked after being unmasked as the man behind a widely read Twitter account that provided an abrasive commentary on his colleagues for more than two years. A government official said Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the National Security Council nuclear non-proliferation team. Mr Joseph posted under the now defunct Twitter name @NatSecWonk. He apologised for his "inappropriate and mean-spirited comments". In his tweets, Mr Joseph gave a lacerating commentary on anything from policy to personal appearance. "Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Weiner," he tweeted, referring to the scandal-hit former New York mayoral candidate and his wife, a former aide of Hillary Clinton. "Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein," he added, referring the US envoy to the UN and her husband, who is a former White House official. This month, Mr Joseph joined Republican attacks on Mrs Clinton for perceived failings of her handling of last year's attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. He tweeted that Mrs Clinton "had few policy goals and no wins" in the Middle East. He said Chelsea Clinton was "assuming all of her parents' vices" and targeted figures such as Republican commentator Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney's wife Ann for their looks and weight. Mr Joseph also turned his caustic commentary on Republicans. "So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family?" he tweeted last October. "What utter useless garbage." Mr Joseph's wife is reportedly a staff member for Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee. The Daily Beast website broke the news of his sacking, describing it as a shock and saying Mr Joseph was "well known among policy wonks". But it said that "inside the administration, there was little sympathy for the man who they feel had betrayed their confidence while taunting them all the while". The website Politico said White House officials had worked over months to discover the identity of Mr Joseph - a key member of the team negotiating over Iran's nuclear programme. It said his travel and shopping habits had been profiled by parsing over 2,000 tweets. Politico said his tweets had been "obsessively and angrily followed" by Washington officials, even though the messages had been "barely noticed" outside the capital. In an apology emailed to Politico, Mr Joseph said: "It has been a privilege to serve in this administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me. "What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologise to everyone I insulted." </body>

      <body>Earlier this year the court of appeal dismissed a case brought by Tesla cars against the BBC's Top Gear show in which the car manufacturer asserted that the programme had faked a scene which appeared to show a Tesla Roadster running out of power. The California-based car maker claimed that the episode in 2008 had caused sales of the electric sports car to drop. However, the court of appeal rejected the claim that the report on the often provocative programme had damaged the company's reputation. BBC Newsnight's Gavin Esler went to talk to Mr Musk, the founder of Tesla, SpaceX and PayPal, whose latest proposal is a near-supersonic Hyperloop transport link between Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Following the Kickstarter model used to raise capital for business ideas, they are trying to persuade people that their cause is worth supporting. Ackeem Ngwenya owes London's Royal College of Art over £20,000, and he can only graduate once the tuition fees are paid. So in desperation he has started a campaign on a crowdfunding website. His graduation design project is informed by his childhood growing up in a Malawian rural community, where he had to carry corn for miles each day on terrible roads. Ackeem has developed a wheel that can be manually adapted to suit different terrains. But will he reach his target, and develop the project which has become his obsession?

      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>The phone you can build like Lego</title>
      <description>The Dutch mobile you put together from separate modules</description>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <description>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</description>

      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <title>Mac v PC - the battle resumes</title>
      <description>Apple and Microsoft renew their rivalry</description>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Saving digital art from early death</title>
      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes.  "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collector… there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24537621</url>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <body>Scottish councils have imposed a pay deal on their staff after almost a year of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. Council staff other than teachers will get a 1% rise backdated to April of this year - and a further 1% rise next April. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla. Cosla said it could not allow the "dragging of feet" by the Unison union to continue. "This cannot continue any longer - our employees deserve their pay rise now," said Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry. "We have been in negotiations with the Scottish Joint Council trade unions for almost a full year after making an initial offer in November 2012. "The unions remain divided and the time has come to apply the deal." Mr Hendry added: "I am particularly pleased with the ground-breaking award of a living wage of £7.50 per hour in 2013/14, which will deliver real benefits for employees at the lower end of the pay scale, and an agreement to match the recommended figure due next month from the Living Wage Foundation for 2014/15, which will see a further living wage increase for the lowest paid." The pay deal does not apply to teachers. Earlier this week the largest teachers' union, the EIS, rejected changes to their terms and conditions of employment. The pay deal was conditional on accepting these changes. Mr Hendry continued: "It is deeply frustrating for me that I am not in a position to announce a pay increase at this time for our teaching workforce. "The decision by the EIS not to agree a deal has resulted in what we believe is an unnecessary delay. "Talks will continue in November which we hope will also bring this matter to a conclusion." </body>

      <title>Four jailed over weapons stash</title>
      <description>Four men are jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station.</description>

      <body>Four men have been jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station. Serving soldier William Dempsey left bags of weapons at Carlisle station after getting off a train to Glasgow. He collected them from James Ashdown in Kent. They were destined for Barry Kelly and Craig Colquhoun in Scotland. Dempsey and Ashdown were each jailed for eight years. Kelly was given nine years and Colquhoun seven years. Dempsey and Ashdown had previously admitted conspiracy to buy or sell illegal firearms. Kelly and Darvel were found guilty by a jury of the same offences earlier this month. Liverpool Crown Court heard how Dempsey, 29, from Paisley, left two Army camouflage bags containing the Uzi sub-machine gun, silencer, a handgun and a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun with two cleaners at the station. He asked them to look after the bags for him as he thought he was being followed. The court heard that the mortarman with the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, was dressed in desert combat uniform and had been exhibiting "somewhat bizarre behaviour". He told staff there were snipers at the station. He had collected the firearms from his friend Ashdown, 32, in Canterbury, where Dempsey's barracks were. The court heard how the bags, found on 17 August last year, also contained Dempsey's identification papers and 194 rounds of ammunition which had his name embroidered on them. They were destined for Kelly, 34, from Darvel, Ayrshire, and Colquhoun, 28, from Barrhead. A search at Dempsey's barracks uncovered a handgun-shaped crossbow, several metal tipped arrows and large military batteries. The battalion duty officer confirmed to British Transport Police that no weapons were missing from the armoury. British Transport Police said Dempsey's mobile phone revealed messages between him and Ashdown regarding large cash payments for "toys" - items believed to be the firearms seized at Carlisle. Further investigation revealed links to both Colquhoun and Kelly. On 16 August last year Colquhoun was captured on CCTV at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Paisley paying £3,500 into Dempsey's account. While arresting Kelly, Ashdown and Colquhoun police found £20,000 hidden in the loft of Kelly's house. Prosecutor Nicholas Kennedy said it was not known where the Uzi and handgun were from but the shotgun had been stolen in a burglary at farm buildings in Maidstone in February 2007. Sentencing the four, Judge Robert Warnock said: "I am wholly satisfied that they [the weapons] were destined for use in serious crime and had a clear potential for causing serious injury and death. "Had these firearms reached their intended recipients, I have no doubt they would have significantly contributed to the upward spiral of gun crime in this country." The judge told Demspey he had used his uniform to hide what he was doing on the day he was arrested. "For reasons principally to do with your abuse of alcohol and drugs, you abandoned the firearms at Carlisle station," he said. "I make it clear, however, that these actions were not motivated by remorse or insight but your befuddled and confused thinking brought on by your alcohol and drug abuse and your consequential paranoia and instability." The judge told Kelly he was "clearly a relatively sophisticated criminal who is well-versed in the use and abuse of mobile phone technology". He said his "employee" Colquhoun was a peripheral player in the conspiracy. The court heard that Ashdown, of no fixed address, was an active street dealer of drugs who was motivated to make money to fund his cocaine habit. He was jailed for an additional three years for possession and intent to supply cocaine in a separate case. Mitigating for Dempsey, David Thompson said his client had joined the Army at the age of 17 and had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was described as a "reliable and competent soldier" but his life began to go downhill last July. He had alcohol and drug problems and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his battleground stints. At the time he entered the firearms conspiracy he had accumulated a drug debt of £5,000. Mr Thompson said he was exposed to influences in his home town of Paisley - which he had joined the Army to get away from when he was younger. He said Dempsey "in effect abandoned the consignment at the rail station and disappeared into town." "He tells me he knew he was going to be arrested and was enjoying a final pint of beer." Mr Thompson said it was "a crying shame" that the defendant had become involved in a conspiracy "diametrically opposed" to the 12 years of service he had given to his country. "He is filled with remorse for getting involved and the shame he has brought upon his regiment," the barrister said. The court heard that Kelly maintained his innocence. Following sentencing, Det Ch Insp Simon Taylor, who led British Transport Police's investigation, said: "These four clearly intended to put illegal firearms on to the streets of Scotland and it is a fair assumption that they would have been used to commit criminal acts or to intimidate people. "In uncovering and unravelling the complex conspiracy BTP, in partnership with Kent Police and Police Scotland, have taken this potential threat out of circulation and ensured the conviction of four dangerous men." </body>

      <body>Two brothers have been convicted of killing a man after a feud between rival kebab shops turned violent. Azeem and Zeeshan Aslam were found guilty of culpable homicide after the fatal attack on Anthony Dryden in March. The 42-year-old was battered to death after smashing a window at the Aslams' family takeaway shop in Airdrie. One of the pair was later heard boasting how Mr Dryden had been "fixed". Sentence was deferred. Azeem and Zeeshan Aslam - aged 26 and 23 respectively - had both stood trial at the High Court in Glasgow accused of murder. But a jury found them guilty of the reduced charge of culpable homicide. The killing brought to a head a dispute between the Ali's Kebabs shop, which was owned by the Aslams, and the owners of the nearby Nico's restaurant, where Mr Dryden's aunt worked. This included claims of a fire attack, extortion and other threats. The jury heard how Hamid Shah applied to set-up Nico's takeaway in the same street as Ali's Kebabs. The Aslam family objected to the council, but permission was eventually granted and Mr Shah began renovating his premises. However, Mr Shah and his employees became targets of intimidation even before his shop had opened. Prosecutor Murdoch MacTaggart asked Mr Shah: "Did that bother you?" He replied: "Yes, my shop was set on fire as well. I reported it to the police." It was also alleged the Aslams demanded £150 a week or Nico's would be burned down. Mr Shah told the jury one of the brothers later passed his shop and made a chilling cut-throat gesture. Asked what he thought this meant, the witness added: "It is because they are competition and they are trying to scare me." Windows at Nico's were also then smashed on two occasions. On 23 March this year - the day of the killing - Ali's Kebabs was then struck in an apparent revenge attack when Anthony Dryden broke a window. Mr Shah told the jury he was not behind it but that one of his workers - an aunt of Mr Dryden - had mentioned it as the "police were not doing anything". Mr Shah said: "She did suggest it, but I said no. She said it two or three times, but then I said it is up to you what you want to do." The jury heard how the Aslam brothers raced out of their shop and chased Mr Dryden into a back garden nearby. Azeem Aslam repeatedly hit Mr Dryden with a baseball bat while his brother struck the victim with a piece of wood that had been lying on the ground. The pair then fled leaving their battered victim to die. Azeem Aslam was later heard saying: "Fixed that guy - even broke the baseball bat." Mr Dryden, of Motherwell, suffered serious skull and brain injuries from which he did not recover. Azeem Aslam testified during the trial and admitted there had been "tension" between the two takeaways. He recalled hitting Mr Dryden "four or five times" that day, but only in self defence. He claimed the victim had a hammer. Azeem Aslam insisted: "I had to do it - I had no choice." But prosecutor Mr MacTaggart said Mr Dryden was the one defending himself as the brothers came at him in a "pincer movement" with "weapons raised". The advocate depute went on: "Mr Dryden just gave up and accepted that he was going to get a beating. That's what he got from you and Zeeshan." The accused denied that was the case. Judge Lord Stewart deferred sentencing for reports until 21 November at the High Court in Edinburgh. </body>

      <description>Scottish Labour's Cara Hilton wins the Dunfermline by-election for the Scottish Parliament, taking the seat from the SNP.</description>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <body>A major search has been launched after a passenger was reported missing from a ferry in the Northern Isles. The passenger - believed to be in his 40s - was thought to have gone overboard from the NorthLink ferry Hrossey, which was sailing from Kirkwall in Orkney to Lerwick in Shetland. The area being searched is to the east of the island of Sanday in Orkney. Three lifeboats and a coastguard helicopter were involved in the search. A fisheries protection vessel and a local fishing boat were also assisting. Ferry operator NorthLink said the captain of the Hrossey was notified of the incident at about 04:00. They said he immediately turned his vessel to begin a search for the passenger. The MV Hrossey left Kirkwall at 00:25 and had been due to arrive in Lerwick at 07:30. It had 172 passengers on board. Hrossey was later released from the search, and headed to Lerwick. </body>

      <body>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent has been found guilty of contravening maritime regulations. The Atalanta of Chester, belonging to Lt Roland Wilson, of Stanley, Perthshire, collided with the 260m-long Hanne Knutsen during Cowes Week 2011. The 32-year-old was convicted at Southampton Magistrates' Court of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was also found guilty of failing to keep a proper lookout. Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time but is now a lieutenant in the reserves, had seen the tanker from five miles (8km) away, the court heard. It had been making its way to Fawley oil refinery. Wilson had told the court the ship had signalled to turn but never did, describing its manoeuvre as "unexpected". District Judge Anthony Callaway said he took the wrong decision in continuing towards the path of the tanker and not taking evasive action. The moment of impact was filmed and the video posted on YouTube, where it was watched more than 924,000 times. Mr Callaway said: "Fortuitous it was that there was no loss of life. The potential for even greater and tragic consequence is, in my judgement, apparent. "This was a serious yacht crewed by serious people in a regatta for a serious purpose. It was well equipped in terms of experience and ability to deal with any situation. "This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel crewed by inexperienced, clueless and foolhardy people who frankly have no business being on the water at all. "The yacht took a decision, and as I find the wrong decision, to sail towards the problem into the path of the tanker across a narrow channel. It should have kept clear and in the worst event used her engine." The judge said conditions in the Solent were crowded due to Cowes Week but the yacht's crew were experienced enough to perform the "difficult manoeuvre". He added: "The fact it didn't do so was the product not of a lack of skill, but the product of the wrong decision at the wrong time, for which the skipper, Roland Wilson, must take responsibility." Cowes Week sailing director Stuart Quarrie witnessed the collision from the shore. He said: "It developed very quickly and at the time, there was no idea if anyone was seriously hurt. "Thankfully, the injuries sustained were relatively minor. "I don't think there's any long-term damage to the relationship between the regatta and the port authorities from this incident because of the professional manner in which it has been dealt with." Mr Wilson was ordered to pay a fine of £3,000, and costs of more than £100,000. The yacht, which had a crew of eight, suffered a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor of the Hanne Knutsen. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship after the collision with the 120,000-tonne tanker. Mr Wilson was convicted of one count of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker in a restricted channel. </body>

      <title>Sharp rise in council's rent arrears</title>
      <description>North Lanarkshire Council claims more than 2,000 of its tenants are in rent arrears for the first time after housing benefit changes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24662376</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70698000/jpg/_70698042_houses.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>More than 2,000 people in one part of Scotland have got into rent arrears for the first time since changes to housing benefit were made in the spring. North Lanarkshire Council thinks it is owed £675,000 from tenants because of the spare room subsidy - dubbed the bedroom tax, by critics. The council is the largest local authority landlord in Scotland. It also believes many people who could be eligible for help to deal with their benefit cut have not applied for it. This is the most detailed assessment so far of the impact of the changes on one council area in Scotland. More than 5,000 council tenants in North Lanarkshire lost some of their housing benefit in April because they were deemed to have spare bedrooms. An analysis produced by the council - covering the six months up to September - said 2,333 tenants who previously had no rent arrears owed the authority money by September. A further 1,100 already had rent arrears before the changes took place. This meant that 3,449 of the 5,201 people who lost some of their housing benefit in North Lanarkshire had rent arrears. Overall, rent arrears over the past six months were up by two thirds compared to the same period last year though the council was stressing the changes to housing benefit were only one reason for this. Tenants now owe the council more than £2.5m in total. The council said about £675,000 of these arrears could be the result of the benefit changes. However, the council also believes that some people who could have been helped by the special discretionary housing payments, available to those affected by the benefit changes, may not have applied for them. This means that some of the arrears may have been avoidable - or that there could have been help for people who have struggled to make up for the loss of benefit. North Lanarkshire said it would not evict tenants solely because of spare room subsidy arrears during this financial year as long as they had contacted the housing service for assistance and advice. A spokesman said: "Clearly the UK government's welfare reforms are already having a significant effect on our tenants. "The council has set aside funds to assist vulnerable people in every way possible but it is essential that tenants who are worried or in difficulty talk to us. "We have hired additional trained advisers who can discuss each case and provide help with applications for financial assistance. We have already helped thousands of people, so anyone who needs that assistance should contact their local housing office." Council leader Jim McCabe condemned the UK government's changes to housing benefit but urged people who have been affected to speak to the council to see if help could be provided. The council has nearly £1.2m available to hand out in these payments - £470,000 of it is from the UK government, the rest is from the council's own budget. So far it has paid out £350,000 in these payments to nearly 2,900 people. Separate figures from the council give some indication of the scale of the arrears that individuals are building up. As of last week, about 460 people have arrears equivalent to the cut in their benefit while 500 have built up new arrears since April of an even greater amount. The other tenants with arrears appear to have tried to make up some of the shortfall or have received help. The Scottish Conservatives' welfare spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said the figures showed that the issue of welfare reform was not as black and white as the Scottish government, and what he called the "left-wing establishment", would like to make out. Mr Johnstone said: "Welfare reform is a challenge that must be addressed so that it is fair to those who receive, and fair on those who pay for it. "The ever-growing cost of the welfare budget is something which successive governments have failed to address. "But the 'ignore the problem and it might go away' approach simply hasn't worked and has only resulted in fostering a culture of people being left to languish on benefits for years." A spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said: "Scotland has been given £10m this year to help vulnerable people and we are monitoring this spending carefully to ensure that tenants get the support they need during welfare reforms. "It is important to remember that housing benefit will still cover the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for spare bedrooms. "People have a number of options available to them, including moving to another property in the public or private sector, or making up the difference in rent through going into work or working more hours." Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess said: "We know that 80% of households affected by the bedroom tax contain an adult with a recognised disability, and over 15,000 children are affected. "That's why have consistently expressed our opposition to this measure. "The Scottish government is doing all it can to help the people hit by the bedroom tax, with £20m of funding available this year and a further £20m available next year." </body>

      <body>Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is showing 14 new acquisitions in a major redisplay of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Glasgow Style works. The eight purchases and six donations add new metalwork, ceramics, glass and stained glass to the collection. They include pieces by David Gauld, Archibald Knox, Alexander Ritchie and Christopher Dresser. The redisplay also features other works from Glasgow's civic collection which have not been on show for decades. The eight purchases were made with financial support from The National Fund for Acquisitions administered through National Museums Scotland, the Art Fund and The Heritage Lottery Fund. Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life, the body which runs Kelvingrove Museum, said the city had "arguably one of the finest civic collections in Europe" thanks to help from partner bodies who helped with funding. "Together we have been able to bring beautiful works by important artists, several of them born in our great city, to the millions of people who visit Kelvingrove every year," he said. "This new display provides plenty to marvel at and an opportunity to learn a little more about their influences and techniques." Glasgow Life said the new acquisitions "reveal the skills, experimentation, influences and imagination" of artists working across Britain between the 1880s and 1930s in the Glasgow Style or part of the wider Arts and Crafts movement. One of the new items on show is a stained and leaded glass panel entitled 'Music', which was designed by Glasgow Boy David Gauld. The piece was made by the Glasgow stained glass workshop of Hugh McCulloch and Company around 1891. Another new exhibit is a copper kettle by Christopher Dresser, a pioneer of the British Design Reform Movement, dating from about 1880 to 1885. This piece was made by Benham and Froud of London. </body>

      <body>The wife of a security guard charged with murdering a conference delegate at Glasgow's SECC complex has told his trial he has a violent temper. Paula Carter told the High Court in Glasgow that she had called police on a number of occasions about her husband Clive's outbursts towards her. Carter, 35, denies murdering Khanokporn Satjawat, 42, from Thailand, at the Clyde Auditorium on 12 November 2012. He has admitted killing her while suffering diminished responsibility. Mrs Satjawat died while attending a conference for HIV drug therapy at the Clyde Auditorium, which is part of the SECC complex. She sustained massive head and facial injuries after being battered with a fire extinguisher in a female toilet. Carter, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was working as a security guard at the venue at the time of the incident. He has claimed he has no memory of the killing or alleged attempts to cover it up. During evidence on Friday, Mrs Carter said her husband could be violent but denied saying that he was manipulative. The witness was asked by advocate depute John Scullion, prosecuting: "Is your husband manipulative, does he manipulate you?" She replied: "No." Mr Scullion referred to a statement in which Mrs Carter allegedly said her husband was manipulative. He asked her: "Does it say: 'If Clive doesn't get his own way he's like my eight-year-old. He stamps his feet, breaks stuff. He's manipulative.' Did you say that to the police?" Mrs Carter replied: "I don't know." The prosecutor accused Mrs Carter of "choosing not to remember." She replied: "Please don't put words into my mouth," then added: "I can't remember." Asked if her husband had ever strangled her, Mrs Carter said he had done so once. He showed her a police statement taken on 13 January in which she stated: "I didn't have any marks or bruises. He just strangled me to the point of going red and then he let me go." Mr Scullion asked: "Did you say that to the police?" Mrs Carter replied: "I don't know, I don't know what the context is. I don't remember the conversation. I can't remember saying that." She did admit to the jury that Carter often had episodes of explosive rage where he would throw things at her. These items included a coffee table and a laptop. She told the jury: "He threw whatever was to hand." She also revealed that on one occasion when he could not find a tin opener he wrecked the kitchen. Mrs Carter said: "The only thing left standing was my microwave." She denied trying to protect her husband, adding: "I don't excuse what my husband has done at all." She also told the prosecutor: "You are trying to portray me as a battered wife. I'm not, I give as good as I get." She told defence QC Ian Duguid that after the violent explosive incidents Carter could not remember what he had done. The witness added: "Once when he pushed me to the ground in a rage he came back into the room and said what are you doing on the floor. He didn't realise what he had done until I told him." The QC then asked: "Is he able to control himself when he's in one of his explosive rages?" She replied: "No." Psychiatrist Dr John Crichton told the jury that he believed Carter had an emotionally unstable personality of the impulse type. The trial before judge Lord Matthews continues. </body>

      <title>Funding boost for Scotland women</title>
      <description>Manager Anna Signeul believes a new funding agreement for the women's game is a "game-changer" for Scotland.</description>

      <body>Manager Anna Signeul believes a new funding agreement for the women's game is a "game-changer" for Scotland. A Scottish Government initiative will provide £200,000 to cover the qualifying period for the 2015 World Cup and allow players to work less. "This is going to have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of these players," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "They are training 15 to 20 hours a week and that is hard to sustain on top of 40 hours work." Scotland have never reached a major tournament, having missed out on the last two European Championship finals at the play-off stage. The majority of Scotland players currently fit their football commitments around full-time work or study and the new financial support will allow for more recovery time as well as more strength and conditioning sessions. "To reduce the work load and be able to rest a little bit more and maybe get some more training time, it's going to make a huge difference," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "Some of the players had already made the decision to work part-time but not everyone can afford to do that." Midfielder Kim Little is one of the few Scotland players to earn a wage from playing and she also welcomes the new injection of money. "I'm very lucky to be at Arsenal and to be able to focus mainly on my football," she said. "It's definitely helped me a lot. "For Scotland to move to the next level, this is definitely the way to go. "You can see the difference funding has made to the England team. They are a very good side now - in the top four in Europe. "In terms of fitness and technique, giving the girls more time to train will improve our national team - without a doubt." Scotland are seeded second in their World Cup qualifying group, behind Sweden, and have opened with high-scoring wins against the Faroe Islands and Bosnia. The Scots host Northern Ireland on Saturday and travel to Poland next week. Meanwhile, Signeul is on a shortlist of 10 candidates for Fifa's Women's Coach of the Year award, with the world governing body describing Scotland as "a quiet success story". </body>

      <body>An Edinburgh author has been named the winner of the Edinburgh International Book Festival's 2013 First Book Award. Angela Jackson, one of 42 writers in contention, said it felt "particularly special" to win the prize for her debut novel, The Emergence of Judy Taylor. Visitors to this year's festival voted her book ahead of other first works by such authors as Gill Hornby, sister of Nick, and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter. Jackson's novel tells of a dissatisfied wife who embarks on a new life. "It's great to know I'm on the right track [and] that my work is connecting with readers," the author continued. The former musician and psychology lecturer said the prize would "spur [her] on to complete my second novel". Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said Jackson's triumph was "a wonderful, home-grown success story". "Angela gave her first public reading at the Book Festival in 2010 and appeared again in 2011," he continued. "We were delighted to welcome her this year as a fully fledged and published author." Edinburgh's book festival, held every August in the city's Charlotte Square Gardens, celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. </body>

      <body>A Scottish health board has uploaded a short film to video sharing website YouTube in a bid to recruit new staff. The video promoting vacancies in NHS Highland's cancer treatment services is the first in a series the board plans to produce to attract new employees. In the six-minute film, workers seek to dismiss misconceptions about the Highlands. Last month, NHS Highland was unsuccessful in a second attempt to fill seven GP vacancies. In the YouTube film, several members of staff talk about what the health board and the Highlands have to offer. They say Inverness's Raigmore Hospital, which has a vacancy for a consultant oncologist, has cutting edge technology to match larger city hospitals. Raigmore has also led the way in the use of image guided radiotherapy, staff point out during the film. The employees have also sought to dispel mistaken ideas about the region. Steve Colligan, head of radiotherapy physics, says: "I think people do believe the Highlands is a bit backwards and not up-to-date and I think it's important to reassure everyone that we have running water and electricity." Dr Carol MacGregor, a Macmillan consultant in clinical oncology, adds that the area offers a wide range of activities that do not involve "Gortex and wellies". The Scottish government has supported the use of video to help attract potential recruits to NHS Highland. Health Secretary Alex Neil said: "I am acutely conscious of the challenges we all face in providing high quality, sustainable healthcare - particularly for those who live in remote and rural communities." He added: "Initiatives such as this film produced by NHS Highland will help to promote the benefits of living and working in Highland." The closing date for applications to the consultant oncologist post is next month. NHS Highland has been facing challenges in recruiting staff to some posts. A renewed effort to fill seven GP vacancies in a remote part of the Highlands was unsuccessful, it emerged last month. NHS Highland re-advertised the posts in the sparsely populated area of West Lochaber after a first round of adverts failed to attract enough applicants. The health board had hoped a new plan for a cluster of local practices would have allayed potential applicants' concerns about having to work alone. But not enough people have come forward to staff that model of cover. The GPs are needed to cover places such as Arisaig, Acharacle and Strontian. </body>

Insp Stevie Dolan said: "Diazepam is a prescribed drug, which should only be taken by those required to consume it for health reasons." He added: "Recovering these pills means we have ensured that they can't make their way into our communities and be used for reasons other than their prescribed purpose.

      <body>Scotland's most senior police officer has pledged to do more to improve road safety in light of a surge in offences. Chief Constable Sir Stephen House said Police Scotland wanted to change the behaviour of drivers who took risks. New figures showed a "significant" increase in the number of road safety offences in the first six months of the new single force, compared with the same period last year. Offences include 52,171 of speeding and 20,440 instances of mobile phone use. There were also 25,451 seatbelt misuse offences. Addressing an audience of road safety experts at the Road Safety Scotland annual seminar in Edinburgh, Sir Stephen said road safety was one of the priorities raised by local communities. "Evidence has shown that regular risky and illegal drivers do not acknowledge the risk they present, or view their own actions as illegal or having any real social impact," he said. "A recent study stated that almost three-quarters of all drivers admitted to risky driving behaviour in the last 12 months and more than half of those admitted to illegal behaviour in relation to speeding, mobile phones and seatbelt use. "There is a common perception among offenders that offences are committed by others, but not by themselves. "Our job is to challenge these perceptions and make people aware that offending behaviour will be dealt with." Sir Stephen said the force would continue to build a trunk roads patrol group throughout the country. "Our focus is on enforcement and by providing a more visible, dedicated resource across our national and local roads networks, we can help deter and detect poor driver behaviour," he said. "Greater enforcement has led to some good early results. However, it is worth remembering that in 2012, 174 people died on our roads - three times more than the homicide rate. "I regard this as simply unacceptable." He added: "We will continue to work with others to improve awareness of road safety and challenge offending behaviour in order to keep people safe on Scotland's roads." </body>

      <body>Two men who spent almost £7,000 with an OAP's credit card have been told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Soham Emmanuel, 21, from Glasgow, pled guilty to duping Catherine Black, 86, into handing over her card and PIN. He also admitted fraudulently obtaining a Macbook, two iPads and other goods totalling £4,200 from Tesco stores. Nouman Chaudhary, 20, also from Glasgow, admitted fraud charges, and charges of theft by taking money out using the card, totalling £2,659. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, both men were told to carry out the unpaid work as part of a year-long community payback order. The court heard how Mrs Black agreed to hand her card over after being contacted at her home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. On 26 June last year, Emmanuel went with another other man to collect the card at Mrs Black's home. It was accepted by the Crown that he sat in a car and did not go to the door, but that he knew why he was there. After obtaining the card, Emmanuel, from Drumchapel, went on a spending spree, buying a Macbook, two iPads and other goods from various Tesco stores. The court heard that the following day, the card was passed to Chaudhary, from Pollokshields. He also bought a number of goods, including two laptops and cigarettes, and withdrew cash using Mrs Black's card. Both men were caught after Mrs Black spoke to a family member about what had happened. The registration of the car used during Chaudhary's shopping trips was traced and both accused were found in the car along with "incriminating articles". The court was told that the bank compensated Mrs Black for her loss but the unrecovered loss from both accused amounted to about £4,000. </body>

      <body>An Argyll seafood firm has won a legal ruling against a local rival over who can trade from green-painted premises. John Ogden and Marion Ritchie said their green shack on Oban Pier lost business after being confused with Gordon MacGillivray's green mobile van. A judge has now granted an interim interdict preventing Mr MacGillivray from running a nearby firm from "wholly or predominantly green" premises. Lord Pentland said it was open for Mr MacGillivray to contest the decision. The Court of Session in Edinburgh heard that the shellfish business run by Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie had been mentioned by "a considerable number of contributors" to the Trip Advisor site as being a green shack or hut or something of that nature. An entry in the Lonely Planet guide had also described it as "the green shack on the quayside". The court heard that Mr MacGillivray had traded for some years, but from a white kiosk. Recently his business has been run from a new green-coloured catering outlet. Paul O'Brien, counsel for Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie, told the Court of Session in Edinburgh: "Ultimately what the pursuer is seeking is for the defender to repaint. "The pursuer is suffering a loss of trade from the confusion generated by the presence of the defender's other green outlet. "It is in a position on that pier where potential customers will reach it first. Although it is not strictly a hut, it certainly is a small portable retail outlet." The judge ruled that Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie had succeeded is showing that they had a case, at first view, based on passing off in the intellectual property action. Lord Pentland granted the partners in Girl Norma Shellfish, an interim interdict against Mr MacGillivray, of MacGillivray's Seafood. Under the terms of the order he is prevented from passing off any bar or restaurant on or within 250 metres of the railway pier in the town as being theirs. It particularly prohibits Mr MacGillivray from carrying on such a business from a kiosk, hut, shack or similar structure that is "wholly or predominantly green". The judge said a number of specific instances had been given in which confusion has arisen because of the presence of two green seafood facilities on the pier. Lord Pentland said a prima facie case was made out by the shellfish business that they have suffered and are likely to continue to suffer financial loss due to the confusion. The judge said he did not think it would be right to dismiss "any such diversion of trade" as minimal. </body>

      <body>Inverness Caledonian Thistle posted a modest gain of £22,000 on the financial year to 31 May; the club's first profit since 2007. The results are a marked improvement on last year's deficit of £379,000. Last season, the Highlanders enjoyed their highest ever placing in the top flight, finishing fourth, despite trimming the wage bill for players. And the club say they continue to operate without any long-term debt or overdraft facilities. There was no cash generated by player sales, with Owain Tudor Jones and Andrew Shinnie among those leaving the club under freedom of contract, but clinching fourth-place resulted in a healthy increase in prize money after a 10th-place finish in 2011/12. Revenue was also boosted by a run to the League Cup semi-finals. "At the start of this financial year, the board in conjunction with the management team had to make some serious cuts to the playing budget following consecutive years of losses which, though manageable, could not be sustained in the long term," said chairman Kenny Cameron. "It is testament to the shrewdness and undoubted skills in 'talent spotting' of Terry Butcher and Maurice Malpas, ably assisted by head scout Steve Marsella, that, having made the cuts in the playing budget, the team excelled under their leadership." Caley Thistle's turnover for this financial year was £3,721,192 compared to £3,443,053 the year before, while administrative expenses were down £111,000. "Our strategy and business model have served us well," added Cameron. "We have substantially reduced our cost base. We have excellent people and a robust strategy that will ensure we continue to improve as a club and a business and strive for the long-term sustainability of the company. "We have improved our balance sheet position from a £60,000 negative in 2012 to a healthy £238,000 positive position, a key health check in any business." The balance sheet money was raised by generating extra share capital. </body>

      <body>A Care Inspectorate order to close Clachnaharry House care home in Inverness could be reviewed. Earlier this month, the watchdog ordered operators RDS Healthcare to shut the home because of concerns about the quality of care provided. The company was given 14 days to ask the inspectorate to review its decision. A spokesman for the watchdog confirmed a request for a review had been received and would be considered. NHS Highland suspended its admissions to the home in November 2012. The Care Inspectorate then served the care home with an improvement notice after raising concerns about the state of flooring and bathrooms. It also highlighted issues over staffing levels and record keeping. RDS Healthcare has plans to close the home temporarily at the end of December to carry out refurbishment work. However, the Care Inspectorate wants more immediate action taken. </body>

      <body>The consortium of international companies that owns and manages Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) is changing its name. From next week Babcock Dounreay Partnership will be called Cavendish Dounreay Partnership. The consortium is overseeing DSRL's work decommissioning Dounreay, an experimental nuclear power complex on the north Caithness coast. The site's original buildings such as its dome are to be demolished by 2025. The rebranding follows the decision of Babcock International Group, which has a 50% stake in the parent body organisation, to call its civil nuclear business unit Cavendish Nuclear. The other partners in the consortium, CH2MHILL and URS, as well as the rest of Babcock International Group, are unaffected by the change. </body>

      <body>Fines are to be introduced next month for vehicles which are parked inappropriately or for too long at Borders General Hospital. From Monday, motorists will receive a "friendly warning". However, that regime will only last four weeks before penalties begin to be imposed. NHS Borders said it remained committed to providing free parking but that the present situation was actually putting people at risk. From 25 November, £90 fines will be issued to those who leave cars in "inappropriate" places - such as outside spaces, on kerbs, on chevrons or in ambulance bays - reduced to £40 if paid within 14 days. The car parks nearest the hospital will be designated for short stays with a four-hour limit for both patients and staff between 08:00 and 17:00. Monday sees the start of a four-week transitional period before the fines are brought into force. </body>

      <body>The chairman of a council social work committee has said the authority faces a "challenge" in finding the resources to meet demand for its services. Andy Ferguson was speaking after a report showed a rise in the deficit facing the Dumfries and Galloway Council department to £205,000. Savings of some £1.1m also need to be found by March next year. Mr Ferguson said he believed the fact that services were working well could create extra budget pressures. He said finances could always be put under strain by surges in demand. "We cannot give guarantees - we do not know what is going to come through the door," he said. "There was an increase in children, for example, who have been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum. "We are identifying earlier and dealing with earlier the problems that some children have." He said better awareness, improved working between agencies and early identification had to be a "positive thing". "It does create a challenge for the politicians in how we actually get the resources to meet that need," he added. </body>

      <body>Staff at Stirling Council have called off industrial action which was set to take place from Monday. The two-week bin collection strike was suspended after the council and unions agreed to re-enter discussions over terms and conditions. A meeting between the council and the GMB, Ucatt, Unison and Unite unions will be held on Monday. A joint statement said the action had been suspended to allow for negotiations. The dispute has centred on the council's plans for a 0.5% pay cut across all pay grades and an additional hour of work per week. A revised offer which included a guarantee to restore the pay cut, and implement a national 1% pay rise, at a future date was rejected by the unions earlier this month. The unions said the changes did not address the key issues of working more hours and changes to terms and conditions. The council has said the changes are necessary as it needs to make savings of £24m due to a real terms cut in the funding it receives from the Scottish government. </body>

      <body>The 60th anniversary of one of the most tragic days for the RNLI in Arbroath is to be marked this weekend. Six crewmen died when the Robert Lindsay lifeboat was struck by a huge wave close to the harbour on 27 October 1953. Only one man survived. They had been searching for a vessel in distress. Their lives will be commemorated by the local community and the current RNLI crew who will be laying a wreath at sea on Sunday. David Bruce, Harry Swankie, William Swankie, Thomas Adams, David Cargill and Charles Cargill all died in the tragedy. The only survivor was Archibald Smith, who was able to hold on to a rope thrown across the boat by watchers on land. A plaque with the names of the crew is displayed in the Arbroath lifeboat shed in remembrance of the disaster. Alex Smith, the lifeboat operations manager at Arbroath, said: "It is the darkest day in our history here at Arbroath lifeboat station and the sacrifice of those lost has been, and continues to be, an inspiration to generations of crewmen. "Unfortunately, it also serves as a stark reminder of the risks that volunteer lifeboat crews face to help others at sea." Church services will also be held in Arbroath on Sunday to mark the event. All-weather lifeboat RNLB Inchcape will be launched at 15:00 for the wreath-laying ceremony. </body>

      <body>Nicola White has been named as the winner of the 2013 Dundee International Book Prize. Her crime thriller novel, In the Rosary Garden, beat competition from more than 350 entries. The book is inspired by a notorious true case from the 1980s of infanticide in Ireland. The Irish debut novelist has been awarded a publishing deal and a cash prize of £10,000. Her entry was chosen from a final three by a judging panel comprising of Brian Cox, Lorraine Kelly, Norman Foster, Claire Alexander and AL Kennedy. The two runner up titles were Mango, written by Jeff Hayden, and What to do with Lobsters in a Place Like Klippisfontein, by Colette Victor. The ninth winner of the competition, which has been running since 2000, was described by judge AL Kennedy as "courageous and intelligent". Previous publications Although In The Rosary Garden is Nicola's first novel, her short stories have been published widely and broadcast on radio. Last year she was Leverhulme Writer in Residence at the University of Edinburgh and was the 2008 winner of the Scottish Book Trust New Writers Award. The author grew up in Dublin and New York and now lives on the Clyde coast. She previously worked as a contemporary art curator, in Glasgow, and produced arts programmes for BBC radio and television. The decision to award the prize to Ms White was praised by crime novelist Val McDermid who called the book "mesmerising". Ms White said: "I'm just very pleased that the book gets to be ushered into the world in the best way, with editorial care and a bit of fanfare - and the money is no small thing." </body>

      <body>Debate about pension provision in an independent Scotland still lacks clarity in key areas, according to a professional body. European status and what currency would be used were among the main issues at stake, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) suggested. The Scottish government published a paper last month on pensions, if independence is backed. It said the basic state pension would still be paid "on time and in full". The document added that from 2016 new pensioners would be given £160 a week - making them £1.10 better off than those in the rest of the UK. The people of Scotland will vote in the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September next year. They will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country." Martin Potter, leader of the Scottish board at IFoA, said: "Scotland becoming an independent country would have a significant impact on financial services, including pensions and insurance, the regulation of the sector and its future growth. "As an independent professional body with a Royal Charter, the IFoA has a public-interest duty to uphold. "In raising questions that it believes to be pertinent, the IFoA looks to serve the public interest by informing the debate on these important issues ahead of next September's referendum. "Whether a referendum results in an independent Scotland or not, it is right that discussion about how change could affect Scotland happens now. "Across the sector, we are still limited by the lack of clarity to date on the status of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU and the many financial implications of that uncertainty, all of which need to be considered." The paper looks at challenges facing financial services and at cross-border schemes, raising concern about the future of underfunded pension plans. In April, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said changes to pension rules with Scottish independence could force substantial costs on employers with unfunded schemes. European directives mean UK-wide schemes would be deemed "cross-border" and need to be fully funded, the body said. The reported stated: "This is as important a subject for rUK (the rest of the UK) as it is for Scotland. "Many employers based in rUK have Scottish employees. For those companies and their staff, a definitive view on this matter would be very welcome. As such, the matters highlighted within this section would apply to all post-independence cross-border schemes." </body>

      <title>Rent arrears up since benefit reform</title>
      <description>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study.</description>

      <body>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study. The Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR), has published research on the early impact of the measure, which has been dubbed the bedroom tax by critics. It said arrears increased by £789,000 in the period to the end of June 2013. It comes against a background of rising arrears in the past two years. SHR said the report, based on feedback from almost 85% of social landlords, gave the fullest available picture of the early effects of welfare reform on Scottish landlords' rent arrears. Iain Muirhead, the regulator's director of strategy and communications, said: "We want to get more information and see a fuller picture before we would draw any firm conclusions on what is happening and why. "Our research establishes a baseline and we will repeat it each quarter and report the findings." But the Early Impacts of Welfare Reform report revealed that the level of arrears had reduced during the period between March and June in each of the previous two years. In 2011 it fell by £3.5m and by £2.8m in 2012. The report said the total amount owed in rent at 30 June 2013 was £63,125,355, although this included amounts carried over from previous years. It said most landlords were facing the same problems in dealing with the effects of welfare reform. They identified increased workload and income reduction as their two biggest challenges. Support, advice and information to tenants featured prominently in the actions landlords were taking to address the early impact. David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the report provided concrete evidence of a worrying trend. "This heralds tough times ahead for Scottish social landlords - be they housing associations, co-operatives or local authorities - as they face the twin challenges of increasing service delivery costs and reducing income. "Both of these challenges arise directly from welfare reform." The benefit changes form part of a revamped system. Under the new housing rules, 14% will be deducted from housing benefit for one "spare" bedroom and a quarter for two or more. The government says the changes should ensure that people are in suitably sized accommodation and release larger accommodation for people who need it. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time. The franchise is due to start in February 2015 and is expected to run for a maximum of 11 years. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Since 2009, the line has been run by Directly Operated Railways, an arms-length company overseen by the Department for Transport. Figures in Friday's document suggest total journeys on the line have increased by a million to 19.1 million under public ownership while revenue has risen by 11% to £692m. In the year to October 2013, 89% of East Coast trains arrived at their final destination within 10 minutes of their advertised time, compared to a national average of 92%. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC the firm had done a "good job" but the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "There is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned nearly £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 393-mile London to Edinburgh route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. "We think it should be allowed to get on and act as a public sector comparator for the other rail franchises," shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh told the BBC News Channel. Asked why Labour had changed its policy since 2009, when it said public ownership was temporary, she argued the facts had changed. "We have been very surprised and happy with the directly operated railway...We think, at the very least, it should be able to bid for this franchise." The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. But the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks on behalf of commercial train operators and Network Rail, said the rail network had been transformed under such a public-private business model. "This partnership is a winning formula that is delivering for passengers, businesses and the taxpayer," said the group's director general Michael Roberts. Consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said it would be scrutinising the tendering process very carefully. "It has never been more important that companies are publicly held to account for their passenger satisfaction ratings - these must be built into the very heart of the contract," said its chief executive Anthony Smith. "However, it is good to see the franchise process moving ahead again and unlocking much-needed investment." </body>

      <title>Scottish Power raises prices by 8.6%</title>
      <description>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% on dual-fuel energy bills in the same week as being hit by a penalty for its sales tactics.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <body>Former director Dave King aims to help build consensus on the best way forward for Rangers. The South Africa-based businessman is in Glasgow for talks with both factions in the power struggle for boardroom control at Ibrox. "I'm here to see whether I am in a position to facilitate taking the club forward," said King. "To get rid of the disunity and lack of harmony both at board level and between the board and the fans." King, who invested £20m when Sir David Murray owned Rangers, has said he wants to lead the club's return to the top tier of Scottish football. On this visit, he met Sandy Easdale, one of three members of Rangers' football board. Sandy Easdale said: "I had a very pleasant meeting with Dave King at McGill's Buses in Inchinnan. "He's a very interesting man and I enjoyed his company. However our discussion was private and I will be saying nothing further." King will also hold talks with the Paul Murray-led group of shareholders, who are seeking to gain influence on the running of the League One club. "I am here for a series of meetings that are at my request," added King on his arrival at Glasgow Airport. "These meetings will remain confidential." King also spoke of his intention to explore the possibility of "assisting in a fund-raising exercise". He said: "We need a funding campaign to make sure that when the club does need money, that it is already in place with the right people at the right cost." </body>

      <body>Ricky Burns is "99%" certain to make a February return against the man who broke his jaw, according to the WBO world lightweight champion's manager. Alex Morrison says a deal is all but done for Mexico's Raymundo Beltran to return to Glasgow for a rematch. Their first meeting ended in a controversial draw last month, with the Beltran camp saying the decision "robbed" their man of the title. It emerged afterwards that Burns had broken his jaw during the fight. The injury was described at the time as "career threatening" by promoter Eddie Hearn. The Coatbridge fighter subsequently had steel plates inserted into his face to repair the damage. Burns returned to light training earlier this month and now Morrison says his fighter is keen to do the right thing. "Ricky feels it's the moral thing to do in giving Beltran another shot," Morrison told BBC Scotland. "He wants to put the record straight after fighting for 10 rounds with a broken jaw in that first fight. "We want it. Beltran wants it and the fans want it. The deal is done. We're 99% there with it and are just waiting for the final confirmation which will happen any day now. "We're looking at early February in Glasgow." </body>

      <body>Partick Thistle manager Alan Archibald expects to lose Gary Fraser to an extended ban following a "red mist" moment from the midfielder. The 19-year-old was sent off in a midweek Under-20s match, which incurs an automatic two-match suspension. But he has also been served with a notice of complaint by the Scottish FA after being cited for "punching a player on the opposing team". The charge adds: "thereafter kicking him repeatedly on the head and body". Fraser has made four first-team appearances since joining on loan from Bolton and his excessive misconduct case will be decided at a disciplinary hearing at Hampden on 14 November. Dunfermline's Chris Kane is Fraser's alleged victim and he was also sent off by referee Grant Irvine, along with Thistle's Dale Keenan. "I wasn't at the game which is a blow as I would have liked to have seen it myself," said Archibald. "I got the match official's report yesterday and it doesn't make good reading. "I spoke to Gary. He just said the red mist came down and he retaliated. He knows he let himself down. "He went in and apologised to the player and the referee but all we can do is wait for the hearing. "I think he will get a lengthy ban but some reports are saying a year out of football. "I don't know where that is coming from. I have seen a lot of people doing a lot worse than that and get a lot less so I think that is madness. "He is a young lad, nobody wants to see a young lad not playing football for a year." </body>

      <body>There were a few cheers, a few hoots on the horns of cars and tankers, but this victory was bittersweet. The 1,370 Ineos staff had been forced to swallow the changes to pay, pensions and conditions which they had fought so hard to resist. The reason for their change of heart was clear. Grangemouth was in danger of becoming another Ravenscraig. Not for two decades had Scotland faced such a serious threat to its industrial base. Why? Because this complex matters. It supplies 70% of the fuel to Scotland's filling stations and much to Northern Ireland and the North of England too. It provides power to a vital North Sea pipeline. And, according to the Scottish government, it contributes around £1bn per year to the economy, the equivalent of some 6,500 full time jobs. Ineos had repeatedly warned that the refinery would not be able to carry on without the petrochemicals plant. And so, when the workers faced the cameras with smiles, it was in the knowledge that, just the previous day, half the complex was closing and the other half was in peril. "We were staring into the abyss," said 53-year-old Grangemouth worker John Convery, who added: "I feel very, very pleased. For myself personally, my family and my colleagues. But there's a lot of people who were very, very worried." That view was shared by one of the younger workers here, Ilolo Adigwe. "Hearing that the plant was going to shut was really worrying for everybody," she said. "So now we've got good news, everyone is happy to go back to work." Eddie Heaney, 59, gave a broad grin as he described the decision as "absolutely fantastic". "It's a chance for a new beginning, because if the management and the union can develop trust then this plant's got a great future," he said. In Grangemouth town centre the mellow voice and gentle guitar of Stuart Miller echoed around the shopping arcade. "Let it shine on" the busker sang, and it seemed to suit the mood. Almost every business for miles around depends on the plant. They had looked over the cliff and were grateful to have been pulled back. "I'm delighted at the news today," said Mr Miller, who admitted he had been "gutted" the day before. "I don't think the unions have covered themselves in any glory here," he added. That is a view shared by plenty of people around the plant, particularly among the 2,000 contractors who have lost work as a result of the dispute. Gerry Finn, who runs a bakery in the town, said: "We do rely on Ineos workers and the contractors to come in. It's a big deal for me." He said he was delighted with the settlement. But some contractors may not get back into the complex as quickly as they would hope. The founder of Ineos, Jim Ratcliffe - who made a flying visit to his plant on Friday evening - has warned that it could take until Christmas to fully fire it up again. But it could have been so much worse. Grangemouth was in danger of becoming a byword for the biggest blow to British industry in decades. Instead the town survives and hopes now to thrive again. Just before lunchtime, the workers poured out of the plant, relief etched on their faces. </body>

      <description>Taking a trip on the road with most reports of supernatural activity</description>

      <body>It is reputedly the most haunted highway in Scotland. The A75 in Dumfriesshire is said to have had more reports of supernatural activity than any other road in the country. Now a Dumfries-based group of paranormal investigators has collated the stories for a ghostly Halloween road trip on Saturday night. The Kinmount straight on the road is the most notorious spot for sightings. John Hill, of Mostly Ghostly paranormal investigators, said: "So much has happened at this spot. "A quick search of the internet would bring up the A75 as the most haunted road in Scotland and some say Britain. "There are so many different things have happened on this road and been seen by so many different people as well." Mr Hill and Mostly Ghostly founder Kathleen Cronie have researched the road's supernatural history to compile the first ever ghost coach tour of the road. They have some spine-chilling accounts to relate. "There have been screaming hags, eyeless phantoms and a menagerie of unearthly creatures witnessed on this famous road," said Ms Cronie. She said one of the most infamous sightings was made by Derek and Norman Ferguson, in 1962. "They were driving along here and the whole incident began with a large hen flying towards the windscreen of their car," she said. "They then witnessed great cats and various other creatures as well as witnessing a phantom furniture van - which is a bit unusual to say the least." Bob Sturgeon lives beside the A75 and used to run a roadside snack van - at Carrutherstown, near to the sighting "hotspot". "There was very rarely a week went past without somebody telling me about some experience and usually along that Kinmount straight," he said. His business was a frequent early morning refuge for traumatised lorry drivers who had parked overnight in nearby lay-bys. "They weren't the kind of people who would talk to each other," he explained. "They were long-distance drivers - they were well separated - so it wasn't as if there was a group of them gathered in a pub and passed round stories. "Most of these things were all just individual experiences." A common sighting was groups of dejected bedraggled people pulling handcarts or carrying bundles like some medieval camp followers. One man was so shocked, he gave up lorry driving altogether and Mr Sturgeon never saw him again. "He had been parked on the Kinmount straight and he had woken up at the back of three in the morning and he saw this 'parade' of people," he said. "He said that it went on for ages and he had just frozen - he was in an awful state. "It doesn't matter if you blame it on imagination or fact or whatever, it certainly affected him badly." Documented reports of ghosts on this road go back at least 50 years. As well as seeing assorted animals, horsemen and carriages, some drivers have been convinced they have run over people - phantom figures of men, women, couples emerging from the dark. Saturday night's ghost tour is for Halloween but it is likely to be repeated several times a year, for those with the stomach to listen to the stories and the nerve to face the possibility of a spooky experience of their own. </body>

      <title>Electric dreams: Life off the Grid</title>
      <description>Family lives life off the Grid</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-24624883</url>

      <body>In the shadow of a power line undergoing a £600m revamp is a family of six with no connection to the National Grid. A BBC documentary recorded a year in their lives. For 19 years the Pococks have lived off the electricity grid, on a croft at Cougie in Glen Affric in the Highlands. They are fiercely proud of where they live and about being self sufficient. The family grows its own food - they have two dairy cows, pigs, sheep, geese, ducks and hens. Mum Sasha, 36, runs a pony trekking business while her 42-year-old husband, Iain, supplements the household income by gathering and selling scrap metal. The couple's four children - Sarah, Ryan, Ewan and Douglas - help with the running of the croft and pitch in looking after the livestock and the trekking business's 19 horses. The effort to heat and light the crofthouse, however, dominates family life. The croft is not connected to the National Grid and the family gets its electricity from a generator and a small wind turbine. But when diesel levels are low and the wind does not blow, the TV and domestic appliances are out of action and the children have to do their homework by candlelight and head torches. With a lack of power comes great responsibility. Iain carries out regular maintenance to the diesel generator and wind turbine, while the children spend a cold and wet Saturday gathering firewood. Tonnes of timber are needed to keep the house warm in winter. Iain's mother, Val, also lives on the croft. She and her family moved from Cardiff to Cougie in 1962 seeking an alternative to city life. Sixty percent of her pension goes on paying for fuel. The Pococks say they cannot get grants to install a larger turbine or solar panels because the funding requires surplus power to be exported to the Grid. Ironically, the croft is close to a massive multi-million pound electricity project. Energy giant SSE is upgrading the 137-mile (220km) Beauly to Denny transmission circuit. The 400,000-volt line will triple the capacity of the existing system, and eventually transmit vast amounts of energy from planned renewable power schemes in the Highlands to central Scotland. Six hundred new towers are being built - a reduction of 200 on the existing number. However, some towers are taller and reach heights of 65m (213ft). Opponents to the upgrade have complained that the new towers will spoil mountain landscapes. The project is expected to be completed in 2014 at an estimated cost of £600m. Sasha says the upgraded line is a blot on the landscape and, in return for having to live with it, her family should get some help getting mains electricity. "We live here in a croft at the end of the glen in the middle of nowhere, and we love it," she says. "We chose to live here. It's a great place to raise a family." But while she and her family thrive in the glen's wild, wide open spaces, Sasha is desperate for a reliable source of power. Seeing work being done to the Beauly-Denny line only fuels her quest for it. Tending to a ewe and her young lambs on a hillside overlooking the croft, Sasha's eldest child Sarah admits some people frown at her family's lifestyle. She said: "One of my friends goes to me: 'Oi, you don't look like a hillbilly, but you live like one'. And I go 'yeah, I suppose you could say that, but we're not quite though'." For Sarah there is a big distraction from the family's electric dreams. She has left school for university and swapped Glen Affric's quiet dark nights for the bright lights of Edinburgh. Power to the Pococks; A year in the life of a crofting family is a Timeline Films production. It will be shown on Thursday on BBC Two Scotland from 21:00. </body>

      <body>The BBC's Newsnight Scotland programme is appealing for members of the public to join an audience for its next debate on issues associated with the independence referendum. The programme makers want to hear what you think about Higher and Further Education in Scotland. They also want to know your opinions on the way universities and colleges operate, their funding, admissions policy and research resourcing. Do you think independence would be good or bad for post-school education in Scotland? Or does the status quo offer a weaker or stronger future for the tertiary education sector? If you would like to discuss these and other issues with an invited panel of guests, please fill in the application below. The special programme will be recorded on Monday, 28 October, at BBC Scotland's Glasgow headquarters. Participants will need to be available from 17:45 to 20:30. Guidelines require the BBC to reflect a broad range of views. To help us do this, we will ask all members of the audience whether they are associated with a political party, if they already have a view on the referendum and where in the British Isles they are from. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, next year when they will be asked the straight yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" </body>

      <body>We're looking for your digital photographs from around Scotland. You send them to us and we'll include a selection on the weekly picture gallery published every Friday on the BBC Scotland news website. They don't have to be related to a news story - they could be a local landmark, a gathering of friends - anything really that depicts life in Scotland. BBC Scotland weather presenters are also looking for your pictures of weather scenes from around Scotland to use on television. However, if you send in photographs of children, we must have written permission from a parent or guardian of every child featured (a grandparent, auntie or friend will not suffice). Email your pictures to newsonlinescotland@bbc.co.uk Please give us your name, where you live and brief details about the pictures. If you want to send your picture from your mobile phone, email them to the same address as above. You can send them from any network or phone. If you would like your image to be included in the weekly picture gallery, please make sure it has a minimum size of 976x549 pixels for landscape and 412x549 pixels for portrait. You can also tell us what you think of the week's pictures on the BBC Scotland News facebook page. If you submit an image, you do so in accordance with the BBC's terms and conditions. In contributing to BBC News you agree to grant us a royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to publish and otherwise use the material in any way that we want, and in any media worldwide.

      <body>The Scottish Sun says axed Grangemouth staff have been thrown a 24-hour lifeline after bosses agreed to review a decision to shut the plant. According to the Daily Record, the future of Scotland's biggest industrial site lies in the hands of just one man, Ineos founder Jim Ratcliffe. Billionaire Ratcliffe, says the Herald, has not commented on Unite's u-turn over the ultimatum that its 800 workers must accept a wage freeze and the end of their final salary pension scheme. The Scotsman reports that the Ineos chairman is expected to decide today whether to revive a rescue deal for the plant. In the Press and Journal, the last survivor to escape from the wreckage of a helicopter which plunged into the North Sea reveals he still has nightmares about the disaster. </body>
