      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; Â£210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>

      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>BT told to change 'misleading' TV ad</title>
      <description>A BT TV advert has been called "misleading" by the ASA over claims it made about what can interfere with wi-fi signals.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has told BT to change a TV advertisement, following complaints about claims it made about wi-fi interference. In the advert, BT said its new Home Hub could handle interference caused by gadgets that use the same radio spectrum as wi-fi. The ad showed gadgets such as mobile phones and radios, wrongly suggesting they could slow wi-fi speeds. BT said it would review its ad approval process in the wake of the ruling. The ASA said the advert was misleading because of the prominence it gave to devices, such as phones and radios, that did not interfere with wi-fi signals. In its judgement, the ASA acknowledged evidence cited by BT suggesting some non-wi-fi devices, such as baby monitors and video senders, could interfere with wi-fi but said these did not feature significantly enough in the advert. "We considered that the inclusion of images of mobile phones and radios implied that consumers who had those items in their homes may experience problems due to interference when we had not seen any evidence to that effect," it said. The ASA has told BT that the advert must not be broadcast in its current form. In an official statement , BT said the ASA had agreed that some household devices could interfere with wi-fi but conceded the watchdog's point that such devices had not featured enough in the advert. "We are reviewing our legal sign-off processes to ensure that creative visuals accurately reflect our substantiation in future TV ads," it added. </body>

      <title>New top-level web domains announced</title>
      <description>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced.</description>

      <body>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) is expected to roll out the new names within weeks. They are: Ø´Ø¨ÙØ©, the Arabic word for "web"; æ¸¸æ, the Chinese word for "game"; and the Russian words for "online" and "web site", Ð¾Ð½Ð»Ð°Ð¹Ð½ and ÑÐ°Ð¹Ñ. Icann hopes hundreds of new top-level domains will eventually be made. Until now, generic top-level domains (gTLDS) - as they are known - were limited to mostly familiar endings such as .com, .net and .biz. But Icann has decided to open this system up, inviting companies to submit applications for names they would like to register. Firms came forward to request almost 2,000 new names including the likes of .porn, .ninja, and .ferrari. The BBC expressed an interest in .bbc. Google made 101 requests, including .google and .youtube, and also had more unexpected ideas such as .and, .boo, .dad and .new. It will take some time for Icann to process all of those requests, particularly in cases where more than one firm wants to own the same gTLD - such as .music, requested by both Amazon and Google. The most popular domain name was .app - with 13 different companies interested in it. Wednesday's announcement marks the first set of domains in the new system to be approved. "You'll note that all four of these new strings are Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)," said Christine Willett, vice president of the gTLD program, in a blog post. "This will be the first time non-Latin characters can be used in a generic TLD." She added: "The move is an effort to create a more inclusive internet." The new domains will now "proceed to delegation", the final stage before being made live - expected to happen within the next couple of weeks. </body>

      <title>Teenagers' anti-sexting app launched</title>
      <description>A children's charity launches a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves.</description>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <title>Bletchley Park to offer web advice</title>
      <description>Britain's World War II codebreakers' centre in Buckinghamshire is to offer internet safety advice for children when it reopens.</description>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when it reopens next year. The Bletchley Park Trust is restoring the site near Milton Keynes and expects to get 250,000 visitors a year. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to reopen the site in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <title>Ebay aims for one-hour delivery</title>
      <description>Ebay announces it will acquire start-up Shutl as it aims to bring one-hour delivery to the UK.</description>

      <body>Ebay has announced it is to acquire start-up Shutl in a bid to bring one-hour delivery to the UK. The service will be offered when both seller and buyer are in the same area. The online auction site already has a similar service in San Francisco and New York, and hopes, with Shutl, to add more than 20 other US cities next year. The UK service will start in London. Speedy delivery is seen as a key growth area for retailers, with rivals such as Amazon also rolling out new services. Its AmazonFresh offering, which is so far only available in Los Angeles or Seattle, sources products from grocery shops, restaurants and other local businesses - essentially acting as a enhanced courier service. Other start-ups such as San Francisco-based Instacart promise the same, although its approach is not to have any direct tie-up with retailers. "Today, approximately 75% of what people buy is local, found within 15 miles from their home," said eBaymarketplaces president Devin Wenig in a statement announcing the Shutl acquisition. "Traditional retail isn't going away. But it is transforming, and that creates enormous opportunity within the $10 trillion total commerce market." No financial details of the deal were disclosed by either company. Shutl already operates in the UK, counting retailers such as Schuh, Warehouse and Argos among its clients. It allows customers to choose as-soon-as-possible delivery - its record is just under 14 minutes - or to select a one-hour window in which to receive the goods. Using rapid delivery comes at a cost - Shutl adds an extra Â£6.99 to some products if they are needed quickly. Founder and chief executive Tom Allason said that Shutl would continue to work with all its existing partners, but would expand to accommodate eBay's plans. "E-commerce is quick and convenient, two things that delivery is not," wrote Mr Allason. "Together with eBay, we believe that we can transform this market and fulfil our mission." </body>

      <title>Google Chrome adds parental controls</title>
      <description>Google's web browser, Chrome, introduces controls that allow parents to monitor their children's browsing history and block certain websites.</description>

      <body>Google has introduced controls to its Chrome web browser that allow parents to monitor and control the browsing behaviour of their children. The new feature, called "supervised users", allows "managers" to set up profiles of the people they want to monitor. Managers can view the supervised users' browsing history, block specific sites, and approve access requests. The feature is available on Windows, Mac and Linux operating systems. It is also available to Chromebook users. But Google says the default setting is to allow a newly created supervised user to view all websites - managers have to specify what sites they want to block. SafeSearch is activated automatically for supervised users, preventing most adult content from appearing in Google search results. The move comes after growing concerns over inappropriate content children can be exposed to online. Other browsers, including Microsoft's Internet Explorer, offer content controls that can be set by an administrator. Microsoft's Windows Phone operating system enables users to set up a "Kid's Corner" section on the phone that only allows access to specified games, music, videos and apps. Kids are unable to access disallowed websites. A recent survey found that many youngsters aged nine to 11 were engaging in risky behaviour online, such as sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, including the 18-rated Call of Duty series. ISC2, an organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety, also found that 43% of youngsters went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours online every time they did so. Another survey, by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, found that 69% of teachers and 40% of young people thought online safety should be taught in more schools and included in the national curriculum. </body>

      <title>Apple shows off thinner iPad Air</title>
      <description>Apple shows off a new thinner top-of-the range iPad, which it says is lighter than any other full-sized tablet on the market.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24629711</url>
      <date>1382470481</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70645000/png/_70645910_air.png</thumbnail>
      <body>Apple has unveiled a top-of-the-range tablet called the iPad Air that is 20% thinner than the previous version. The 9.7in (24.6cm) computer is 7.5mm (0.3in) thick and weighs 1lb (469g), which the firm claims is the lightest full-sized tablet on the market. It is powered by the same A7 chip found in the company's iPhone 5S. The launch comes at a time when some analysts have suggested that Google's Android is about to overtake Apple's iOS as the bestselling tablet platform. Apple also announced a new version of its iPad Mini. Its 7.9in (20cm) screen has been upgraded to feature 2048 by 1536 pixels - the same as the larger model. It is being branded as "retina" to highlight the increased resolution. Amazon and Google have already announced small tablets - the Kindle Fire HDX and Nexus 7 - with similar high definition displays. "We've got the retina upgrade to the smaller iPad that many thought should have been there in the first place," Tony Cripps, principal analyst at tech consultants Ovum, reflected after the announcement in San Francisco. "Market share slip is inevitable because so many rival devices are coming out, which is not necessarily a bad thing as the overall sector is growing. "Apple does now have a cheaper model thanks to it offering the original iPad Mini at a lower price - but the firm doesn't really want to go to the low-end because that's not where the greatest profit is extracted." Apple also announced that the latest version of its Mac operating system, Mavericks, would be offered at no cost to owners of computers already running any version of OS X released since 2009. It is the first time the company has not charged for a major Mac OS upgrade. By contrast the full version of Windows 8.1 is sold for about Â£100, although it is free to existing Windows 8 users. Linux-based Ubuntu has always been offered without charge. Chromebook computers also get free upgrades for Google's PC operating system. New laptops, productivity and leisure apps were also unveiled. However, Apple did not show off a new TV set-top box as some had speculated. The California-based firm's most recent financial release said that its iPad range accounted for $25.8bn (Â£17.6bn) worth of sales in the nine months leading up to July. That represented 19% of its revenue for the period. However, Apple acknowledged that the amount of money it was making from the product line was growing three times slower than the growth in unit sales since many customers were opting for its cheaper iPad Mini and iPad 2 models rather than its top-of-the -range "retina display" versions. It also faces the fact it is losing market share to rivals. Apple's iOS operating system accounted for 53.9% of all tablets shipped in 2012, according to Gartner. The tech research firm forecasts that Android will become the market leader with a 49.6% share, versus Apple's 48.6% this year, adding that it expects that gap to widen further in 2014. However, consultants at IHS iSuppli said those figures needed to be put in context thanks to Apple's success at making money by taking a cut of app sales. "It is in terms of revenue per active device where Apple's lead is strongest," said the firm's mobile media analyst Jack Kent. "An iOS device generates around three to four times as much app revenue through Apple's App Store as an Android device through Google Play. "Apple has so far offered a more compelling range of tablet-specific content, but Google is clearly looking to address this." He added that many Android tablets, including Amazon's Kindle and most products sold in China, did not have Google's store pre-installed. Apple's chief executive Tim Cook noted there were now 475,000 apps designed for iPads available through its online marketplace. But another market watcher suggested that Apple's priority remained securing a "premium" margin on the shop price of its hardware, and that add-on software sales were of secondary interest. "Some players, like Amazon, can afford to slash prices because they have a different business model based on content and commerce," said Thomas Husson, from the tech industry analysts Forrester. "While Apple has shared $13bn to developers since 2008, it has made less than $6bn out of apps. "It's a huge stat, but low in comparison with Apple's quarterly results." </body>

      <title>Mobile users win penalty-free switch</title>
      <description>Mobile, landline and broadband customers will be able to leave their contracts mid-term without paying a penalty if their provider puts up prices, the regulator confirms.</description>

      <body>Mobile phone customers will be able to leave their contracts mid-term without paying a penalty if their provider puts up prices, the regulator has confirmed. Ofcom said that customers must be given 30 days' notice of any price rise in their monthly subscription - even if it is within the level of inflation. A provider must then allow a customer to exit their contract without a penalty. Mid-term price rises are allowed, but must be made clear to consumers. There are no specific changes to the rules, but the way they were interpreted has differed among providers. The regulator decided to offer guidance to providers to make it clear exactly how they should behave, and encourage competition. This will take effect in three months' time and will apply to any new mobile, landline and broadband contracts, including some bundled contracts, entered into from that point in time. "Ofcom is today making clear that consumers entering into fixed-term telecoms contracts must get a fairer deal," said Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's consumer group director. "We think the sector rules were operating unfairly in the provider's favour, with consumers having little choice but to accept price increases or pay to exit their contract. "We are making it clear that any increase to the monthly subscription price should trigger a consumer's right to leave their contract - without penalty." The consumer group Which? has campaigned for clarity from the regulator. "Consumers told us price hikes on fixed contracts were unfair, and now people will be able to leave these contracts and switch to a cheaper provider without being hit by extortionate exit fees," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. Ernest Doku, of price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers shopping around for deals, said: "Hopefully it will make providers think twice about increasing prices - they won't want to lose customers two months into a 24-month contract. "But even if this move does not stop prices going up, at least consumers will be able to vote with their feet and say no to higher bills by moving to a new deal." </body>

      <description>Two Windows Phone phablets and a Windows RT tablet are among the final devices unveiled by Nokia ahead of the sale of its hardware unit to Microsoft.</description>

      <body>Nokia has unveiled its first phablets - extra-large phones - as well as its first tablet computer. The Windows Phone handsets introduce the ability to change which objects in a photo are in focus after it is taken. The Windows RT tablet has a 4G data chip, unlike Microsoft's recently unveiled Surface 2. Nokia World in Abu Dhabi is likely to be remembered as the Finnish firm's last major event before it completes the sale of its hardware unit. Microsoft agreed to buy the business for 5.4bn euros ($7.4bn; Â£4.6bn) in a deal which the companies have said should be finalised by early 2014. Nokia's former chief executive Stephen Elop, who resigned to become head of the company's devices and services division until his transfer to Microsoft, admitted to the BBC that choosing Windows Phone rather than Android as an operating system had presented the company with "a very difficult challenge." "It's been hard. It's a very difficult challenge; it's a very competitive environment, but we're pleased with the fact that we're building momentum," he said. One analyst said the sale should aid the US firm's efforts to promote its mobile platforms against the market leaders, Google Android and Apple iOS. "For the last two years Microsoft and Nokia's marketing efforts have jarred against each other at times - having one big effort should be better than two smaller ones," said Martin Garner, from the consultancy CCS Insight. "Microsoft can also spend a lot more marketing the devices than Nokia could. That does seem to be a key criteria - both Samsung and Apple's spends are very high indeed." Microsoft's share of the handset and tablet markets is growing but from a relatively low level, according to market research firm Gartner. Windows Phone took a 3.3% share of smartphone sales in the April-to-June quarter, said the firm, with Nokia proving the most popular brand. It also forecast that about 1.7% of all tablets shipped over 2013 as a whole would be powered by either Windows RT or the full Windows 8 operating system. Nokia showed off two phablets at the UAE launch. Both the Lumia 1520 and Lumia 1320 feature 6in (15.2cm) displays, allowing extra rows of apps to be displayed on their home screens than possible on smaller models. The firm said that the extra space would also make it easier to use the phones' touchscreen keyboards, suggesting this would appeal to business users who used productivity software. A new Beamer app will allow the phones to stream the contents of their screens onto to a web browser on a separate display. It works by sending data via Nokia's computer servers. Another new app - Refocus - lets owners determine which parts of a photograph are in focus and which are blurred after it is taken. The phones achieve this by taking a series of images in quick succession at different focus lengths rather than replicating the light field effect captured by a Lytro camera. Blackberry is among the other companies to have recently launched a phablet, but one expert said doubts about the Canadian firm's future meant that its existing users might be tempted to switch. "There's definitely a chance for Nokia to gain ground, of course everyone else is interested in that space too," said Mr Garner. "It's not a slam dunk, but Microsoft is as well placed as others - better in some respects." The Lumia 2520 becomes the only Windows RT tablet made by a manufacturer other than Microsoft. Dell, Asus, Lenovo, Acer and Samsung had all initially backed the platform only to later change tack. The operating system runs on an ARM-based chip allowing it to offer superior battery life to the full Windows 8 system running on tablets powered by x86 processors, but it does not support as many programs. Nokia's tablet is slightly more compact than Microsoft's version and also distinguishes itself by supporting an optional 4G Sim card. However, bearing in mind Microsoft has already taken a $900m writedown after weak sales of its original Surface RT tablet, one analyst questioned whether the firm would want to produce two competing models. "I don't think that having two devices in that space makes a lot of sense," said Carolina Milanesi, consumer devices analyst at Gartner. "I believe Microsoft may keep the Nokia model on as a cheaper consumer-targeted device focused on media consumption and gaming in order to capture more market share, and also keep on the more expensive Intel-based Surface Pro - but it will phase out the Surface 2 RT model." Nokia also added three models to its Asha range of low-end handsets targeted at emerging markets and shoppers on a budget. They run Nokia's proprietary Series 40 OS rather than Windows Phone. The most expensive of the devices, the Asha 530, now supports 3G data in addition to 2G, allowing faster internet access. "It's important for Nokia and Microsoft to connect the next billion people," said Mr Elop, suggesting that Microsoft would find Asha's popularity a convenient way to promote other services such as its Skydrive cloud storage product. But one market watcher questioned Asha's future. "There's still quite a lot of demand for Asha in developing markets where the phones offer brand-value against other low-cost mass-market handsets," said Chris Green from the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. "So, there's no sense to killing the business while it remains highly profitable. "But will it be a core focus? Absolutely not. It will be a distraction and Microsoft will be keen to migrate users to the Windows Phone platform." </body>

      <title>Critics dismiss new data legislation</title>
      <description>Major new European data-protection laws may have serious loopholes, say critics.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24622919</url>
      <date>1382453941</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70636000/gif/_70636140_deletekey.gif</thumbnail>
      <body>Critics have said new European data-protection laws have loopholes that could render the legislation useless. The rules are the first attempt to create strong data-protection laws for Europe's 500 million citizens. They include a clause to strengthen online privacy in the wake of whistleblower Edward Snowden's allegations about US spying. They also set out ways citizens can erase their personal data - the so-called right to be forgotten. Lawmakers have toughened the initial draft regulation, prepared by the European Commission, to make sure companies no longer share European citizens' data with authorities of another country, unless explicitly allowed by EU law or an international treaty. This is a direct response to allegations from former intelligence analyst Edward Snowden about the US National Security Agency (NSA) snooping on European citizens' data. Another clause seeks to limit user profiling, requiring companies to explain their use of personal data in detail to customers and to seek prior consent. To ensure that the regulation is properly applied, most businesses would have to designate or hire data-protection officers. After 18 months of fierce industry lobbying, the legislation was passed with a 49-3 committee vote, with one abstention. The European Parliament still needs to hold another vote and seek agreement with the EU's 28 member states though â which is likely to result in some changes. "Tonight's vote sends a clear signal - as of today, data protection is made in Europe," said EU justice commissioner Viviane Reding. But French consumer group La Quadrature du Net was disappointed with the draft law. "There are some big loopholes that could void the effectiveness of the whole legislation," said Jeremie Zimmermann, from the organisation. He said vague wording such as "legitimate interest" could allow businesses to "exonerate themselves from the legislation". "A business could say that it is a legitimate interest to collect data in order to provide a better service for consumers or to enable it to make money," he said. He was also surprised that the rules around data profiling were not tougher. "Machines that crunch data are used to make important decisions such as who can get a job, who can get a loan, who can get insurance," he said. "This legislation allows firms to continue to collect and process more data and profile individuals." Bridget Treacy, partner and head of UK privacy and cyber-security at law firm, Hunton and Williams thinks that companies will have to ring the changes in order to comply with the legislation. "It enhances consumer rights and means businesses are going to have to focus on making sure they know what data they've got and what they do with it," she said. "One of the requirements of the legislation is that companies only collect the minimum amount of data that they require for a specific purpose. Firms are going to have to be much clearer about what data they are collecting and why." "It means that they will not be able to hold on to data as a bit of a comfort blanket," she added. Companies that fail to comply with the new law could be subject to a fine of up to 5% of their annual turnover â which could be hundreds of millions of dollars, or even a few billion dollars for internet giants such as Google. Now begins a long process during which the approved legislation will be debated among between the European Commission, the European Parliament and the European Council. It is expected to be concluded in March. </body>

      <title>US agency 'hacked French diplomats'</title>
      <description>New revelations in Le Monde newspaper allege the US National Security Agency spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN.</description>

      <body>The US National Security Agency has spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN, according to the latest claims in Le Monde newspaper. NSA internal memos obtained by Le Monde detailed the use of a sophisticated surveillance programme, known as Genie. US spies allegedly hacked foreign networks, introducing the spyware into the software, routers and firewalls of millions of machines. It comes a day after claims the NSA tapped millions of phones in France. The details in the latest Le Monde article are based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, through Glen Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist, who is feeding the material from Brazil, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. It comes on the day the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in London meeting foreign counterparts to discuss Syria. The Le Monde report sets out details of Genie, an NSA surveillance programme in which spyware implants were introduced remotely to overseas computers, including foreign embassies. It claims bugs were introduced to the French Embassy in Washington (under a code name "Wabash") and to the computers of the French delegation at the UN, codenamed "Blackfoot". The article suggests that in 2011, the US allocated $652m (Â£402m) in funding for the programme, which was spent on "spy implants". Tens of millions of computers were reported to have been hacked that year. A document dated August 2010 suggests intelligence stolen from foreign embassy computers ensured the US knew ahead of time the positions of other Security Council members, before a UN vote for a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran. The US was worried the French were drifting to the Brazilian side - who were opposed to implementing sanctions - when in truth they were always aligned to the US position, says our correspondent. The intelligence agency quotes Susan Rice, then-US ambassador to the UN, who praises the work done by the NSA: "It helped me know... the truth, and reveal other [countries'] positions on sanctions, allowing us to keep one step ahead in the negotiations." On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. At a breakfast meeting with the US secretary of state on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius demanded a full explanation. Referring to a telephone call between the French and US presidents, Mr Fabius told reporters: "I said again to John Kerry what Francois Hollande told Barack Obama, that this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable." Asked if France was considering reprisals against the US, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem replied: "It is up to Foreign Minister Fabius to decide what line we take but I don't think there is any need for an escalation. "We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have." Both French officials made their comments before the latest revelations appeared in Le Monde. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges. </body>

      <title>Blackberry resumes BBM rollout</title>
      <description>Blackberry announces it is resuming the rollout of its BBM messaging app for Android and iPhone after September's botched launch.</description>

      <body>Blackberry has resumed a phased rollout of its BBM messaging app for Android and Apple devices after September's botched launch. The free app is now available for download on Google Play, the App Store and selected Samsung App Stores. But users had to register an email address after downloading the app then wait in line until they were told they could begin using it, Blackberry said. Last month Blackberry had to delay the launch after the software was leaked. The company said that "in just seven hours [following the leak], about one million Android users were using the unreleased version of BBM for Android". This had caused unspecified "issues" for the launch, it said. About six million people had signed up for information abut BBM at BBM.com, the company said. "To help manage this unprecedented pent-up demand for BBM, we are implementing a simple line-up system to ensure a smooth rollout," wrote company spokesman Andrew Bocking. Those who had already signed up for information about BBM were able to start using the app straight away, he said. Others would have to wait in line, but the company did not specify how long the wait might be. The botched launch was the latest in a run of bad news for the struggling Canadian firm, which is cutting 4,500 jobs, made a net loss of $965m (Â£600m) in the second quarter of 2013, and has agreed a $4.7bn sale to a consortium led by Fairfax Financial. Blackberry has failed to keep pace with Apple and devices running Google Android or Microsoft's Windows Phone operating systems. In September, there were reports that it was exiting the consumer market to concentrate on providing services to business customers - reports it has since played down. But the Blackberry Messenger product - known as BBM - has proved very popular, particularly with younger users. The software offers an alternative to SMS messages - which cost money on some subscription plans - as well as other voice and screen-sharing capabilities. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (Â£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>A senior White House official has been sacked after being unmasked as the man behind a widely read Twitter account that provided an abrasive commentary on his colleagues for more than two years. A government official said Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the National Security Council nuclear non-proliferation team. Mr Joseph posted under the now defunct Twitter name @NatSecWonk. He apologised for his "inappropriate and mean-spirited comments". In his tweets, Mr Joseph gave a lacerating commentary on anything from policy to personal appearance. "Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Weiner," he tweeted, referring to the scandal-hit former New York mayoral candidate and his wife, a former aide of Hillary Clinton. "Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein," he added, referring the US envoy to the UN and her husband, who is a former White House official. This month, Mr Joseph joined Republican attacks on Mrs Clinton for perceived failings of her handling of last year's attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. He tweeted that Mrs Clinton "had few policy goals and no wins" in the Middle East. He said Chelsea Clinton was "assuming all of her parents' vices" and targeted figures such as Republican commentator Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney's wife Ann for their looks and weight. Mr Joseph also turned his caustic commentary on Republicans. "So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family?" he tweeted last October. "What utter useless garbage." Mr Joseph's wife is reportedly a staff member for Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee. The Daily Beast website broke the news of his sacking, describing it as a shock and saying Mr Joseph was "well known among policy wonks". But it said that "inside the administration, there was little sympathy for the man who they feel had betrayed their confidence while taunting them all the while". The website Politico said White House officials had worked over months to discover the identity of Mr Joseph - a key member of the team negotiating over Iran's nuclear programme. It said his travel and shopping habits had been profiled by parsing over 2,000 tweets. Politico said his tweets had been "obsessively and angrily followed" by Washington officials, even though the messages had been "barely noticed" outside the capital. In an apology emailed to Politico, Mr Joseph said: "It has been a privilege to serve in this administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me. "What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologise to everyone I insulted." </body>

      <body>Facebook is allowing videos showing people being decapitated to be posted and shared on its site once again. The social network had introduced a temporary ban in May following complaints that the clips could cause long-term psychological damage. Facebook originally pulled decapitation videos after the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of its Safety Advisory Board - complained that they "crossed a line". The charity's leader Stephen Balkam told the BBC he was surprised and upset by the latest development. </body>

      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from Â£2.5m to Â£25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost Â£18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (Â£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [Â£2.5m-Â£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <title>Mac v PC - the battle resumes</title>
      <description>Apple and Microsoft renew their rivalry</description>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Saving digital art from early death</title>
      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes.  "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collectorâ¦ there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; Â£945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet accessâ¦ so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Union 'embraces' Ineos survival plan</title>
      <description>Union leaders voice optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant.</description>

      <body>Union leaders have voiced optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant. The Unite union said it had decided to "embrace" a survival plan put forward by owner Ineos, "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs when Ineos announced the closure on Wednesday. Workers had rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Speaking after the talks, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Before the meeting, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union Unite would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Unite remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that Ineos would reverse its decision. The company had previously said that while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael are expected to hold talks at Grangemouth on Thursday afternoon. Mr Swinney had earlier said that he hoped the talks between the management and union leaders would be "constructive and successful" He said: "I hope that at this very, very, very late stage in the process there is a willingness to listen to and to consider the proposals being put forward. "Everybody is agreed that this plant has a strong future with the necessary investment and that is why the Scottish government is willing to be a player in that." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest Â£300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that Â£300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <title>Primark extends Bangladesh payments</title>
      <description>Discount clothes chain Primark says it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh.</description>

      <body>Discount clothes chain Primark has said it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. Primark told the BBC it would continue to pay the wages of those affected for another three months. The collapse, which happened in April, killed more than 1,100 people. International firms have since faced criticism for lack of collective action to improve the working conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories. In addition to the death toll, more than 2,500 were injured in the disaster. Last month, the global trade union IndustriALL called a meeting of some of the world's largest retailers in Geneva to discuss a long-term compensation fund of $74.6m (Â£47.2m) for the workers injured in the disaster, and the families of those who died. However, only nine of the 23 brands being produced at the Rana Plaza factory were represented at the meeting. Key absentees included Wal-Mart and Benetton and the retailers failed to reach a deal on a compensation fund for victims. The garments manufacturing sector is a key driver of Bangladesh's economy. However, a series of incidents has raised concerns over the working conditions in some of the factories in the country. Last November, 112 workers were killed in a fire at another clothes factory in the same area, and nine died in a blaze earlier this month at a garment manufacturer, again near the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. In September, the BBC's Panorama programme reported that Bangladeshi garment workers had been locked in on 19-hour shifts. As a result, there have been calls to improve the conditions at the units, prompting some action from various stakeholders. But earlier this week, Bangladesh and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreed to launch a $24m initiative to improve the conditions of garment workers. In May, many international retailers agreed to a new code of practice regarding safety inspections for factories. At the time of the IndustriALL meeting, Primark said that it would continue to pay wages to those affected by the fire and building collapse for another three months, having paid for the previous three. The new announcement takes the total to nine months. In his first interview with the BBC, Paul Lister, head of corporate governance at Primark's parent company, Associated British Foods, said that "a lot has been done" since the fire to improve standards, and that the events of April were a "huge tragedy". "We looked on in horror. We knew our clothes were in the building, and we accepted responsibility," he said. When asked what he thought about other retailers not participating in compensation schemes, he said there was "still a long way to go" and that it was "time for others to step up". Mr Lister added that Primark would also welcome a rise in the minimum wage for garment workers. The minimum wage for a worker in such a factory is currently around 3,000 Bangladeshi taka a month (about Â£24; $40). When shown a Primark T-shirt costing just Â£2.50 and asked whether selling cheap clothes meant the people making them had to endure low pay and long hours, he said this was not the case, and that Primark's clothes were "ethically sourced". Mr Lister added that Primark and other low-price retailers often shared factory facilities and manufacturing bases with much more expensive brands. "We share 95% of our factories with other high street retailers. We share factories with Bond Street retailers. It's the same conditions, the same workforce, the same pay." "We know the factory where that T-shirt is made, we will have inspected that factory... we often sit outside factories to make sure the timesheets are correct." Mr Lister insisted that although a worker in a Bangladeshi factory would earn around 10p an hour, the garment industry had a positive impact on the country. "There are four million employed [in the textile industry], 80% of Bangladeshi exports are clothes. It is a way to alleviate poverty. It is a force for good." </body>

      <body>The owner of shoe maker Dr Martens has been bought by the investment firm Permira Funds for Â£300m. R Griggs Group, based in Wollaston, near Northampton, has been making boots since 1901, but became famous with its Dr Martens boot in the 1960s. It will add to Permira's portfolio of fashion businesses which includes Hugo Boss, New Look and Spain's Cortefiel. Griggs was the first firm to use an air-cushioned sole, developed by Munich based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck. The boot that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s. Dr Martens also credit Peter Townshend, guitarist and songwriter for the Who, as another early adopter. According to the company, Mr Townshend says that, while on tour, he would go to bed with two things: a cognac bottle and a Dr Martens boot. </body>

      <body>UK car production continued to strengthen last month, industry figures have shown, with output now having passed the one million mark this year. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said production rose to 140,888 in September, up 9.9% from a year ago. The figures means output for 2013 so far has now reached 1,125,433. In addition, car production for the 12 months to September hit 1.5 million, the highest rolling 12-month total since October 2008. The number of cars produced for export rose 9.3% from a year earlier, helped by high demand in China, Russia and the US for luxury British brands. Mike Hawes, chief executive at SMMT, said the sector was "one of the UK's biggest success stories in recent years". "This long-term financial commitment and robust demand for UK-built products show the global appetite for high-quality, desirable products borne of the UK's world-class design, RandD and engineering," he added. However, while car output rose, production of commercial vehicles (CV) - lorries, buses, trucks and vans - fell 27.6% from a year earlier to 6,963. "CV production remained subdued in September, with continuing uncertainty in the EU and restructuring of UK operations," said Mr Hawes. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; Â£210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <title>Clegg and PM at odds on green levies</title>
      <description>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not agree with the prime minister's bid to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills.</description>

      <body>The prime minister's announcement that he wanted to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills was unexpected, Nick Clegg has said. "It's not something that I fully agree with," the deputy prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Lib Dem leader confirmed that the government was to look into whether its environmental policies could be delivered more cost-effectively. They may be funded in future from taxes rather than green levies, he suggested. But he insisted that the coalition's environmental objectives "remain clear and stable". And Downing Street later said work was under way to examine how green levies "can be rolled back from the bills" and paid for by alternative funding. During his Today interview Mr Clegg said in the weeks ahead he and Mr Cameron "will stress-test all these different levies". "If we can deliver those objectives of keeping the lights on, insulating people's homes helping the fuel-poor, supporting the green economy for less, of course I don't want to see an extra penny go on people's bills that is absolutely necessary." But funding for "looking after the environment, securing thousands of jobs in the renewable green sector, and... giving deductions on people's fuel bills for two million of the poorest households in our country" should not end, he argued. This was not the biggest factor driving up energy bills, Mr Clegg added: "In fact, 60% of the increase in energy bills since 2010 have come from wholesale prices." There was, he said, a "big argument" on energy policy, especially since Labour's announcement that it plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if it wins the next general election. "You've got an argument from Ed Miliband, and it is a con, by the way: his freeze would see prices go up, jobs go down, investment go down. "And then you appear to have a new kind of theory emerging from the right of British politics, which says it is all the fault of us caring about the environment. "I don't accept either of those propositions." Mr Clegg also stressed that he was confident he and the prime minister could "resolve" their differences on the policy. On Wednesday at his weekly Commons question session, Mr Cameron told MPs: "We need to help people pay their bills and we need to help to get bills down. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The Liberal Democrats subsequently accused the PM of making a "panicky U-turn". A senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. The Labour leader said that Mr Cameron "was changing his policy every day of the week". "His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him," he added. In a speech later, Mr Miliband is expected to argue that the PM has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy. Mr Miliband will accuse the PM of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs, according to pre-released extracts of the speech. </body>

      <description>The pace of growth among eurozone businesses eased in October as the service sector slowed, a business survey indicates.</description>

      <body>The pace of growth among businesses in the eurozone eased in October as the service sector slowed, a survey has indicated. The preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from research firm Markit fell to 51.5 from 52.2 in September. However, a reading above 50 still implies expansion, and activity has now grown for four months in a row. Markit said expansion was "broad-based" across the eurozone, although growth slowed in both Germany and France. Germany - which has been the main economic powerhouse for the eurozone in recent years - saw growth slow to a three-month low. Markit also noted that the eurozone's jobs market remained weak. Employment fell for the 22nd month in a row, with the rate of job losses picking up from September. "The survey data have been running in positive territory for four consecutive months now and indicate that the eurozone economy expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.2% at the start of the fourth quarter, suggesting an ongoing, albeit sluggish, recovery," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Spain's economy - which was one of the hardest hit by the credit crunch and subsequent economic downturn - has shown signs this week that it is slowly starting to recover. Official figures show the country's unemployment rate - which is one of the highest in Europe - fell slightly in the third quarter of this year, to 26% from 26.3% in the previous quarter. On Wednesday, the Bank of Spain said the country's economy had emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years. The bank estimated that Spain's economy grew by 0.1% between July and September. The eurozone emerged from recession in the second quarter of this year when it grew by 0.3% following a record 18 months of economic contraction. However, earlier this month, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi said the recovery in the bloc remained "weak, fragile, uneven". He said further support for the banking sector could not be ruled out, and that the ECB was "ready to consider all available instruments" to maintain financial stability and ensure that recovery in the eurozone took hold. There has been speculation that the ECB might offer another round of cheap, long-term loans to banks to keep the cost of credit down. </body>

      <body>Department store group Debenhams has reported a small drop in full-year profits, and says shoppers' incomes are expected to remain under pressure. The retailer said profits fell 2.7% to Â£154m for the year to 31 August, with sales up 2.5% to Â£2.78bn. It said online sales, up by 46.2%, were "well ahead of the market". Online accounted for 13.2% of its total sales. Chief executive Michael Sharp said he was pleased with the results given the "very difficult conditions". He said he expected shoppers' incomes to stay under pressure, giving that price inflation growing ahead of wages. Mr Sharp added: "With this in mind, we remain cautious about the strength and pace of any consumer recovery in 2014 and expect the marketplace to remain highly competitive." Debenhams said it would open four more stores in the UK in 2014. </body>

      <body>(Open): Shares in WPP rose 2% after the advertising giant reported better-than-expected revenues for the third quarter. The firm said like-for-like revenues grew by 5%, up from growth of 2.4% in the previous quarter. On the wider market, the FTSE 100 index was up 23.50 points at 6,697.98. Mining shares were lifted by a survey of China's manufacturing sector which indicated that it grew at the fastest pace in seven months in October. "The number shows expansion in manufacturing which is likely to continue into Q4," said Cailey Barker, an analyst at Numis. "Strong PMI numbers coupled with the view that the Fed is unlikely to taper until Q1 should see mining companies have a strong run into the new year." Rolls-Royce shares rose 2.1% after the company said it had agreed a Â£22m contract to supply oil rig equipment to Samsung Heavy Industries. Sports Direct fell 5.2% after Goldman Sachs said it would sell up to 16 million shares in the firm acquired from its founder, Mike Ashley. On the currency markets, the pound rose 0.2% against the dollar to $1.6194 and fell 0.1% against the euro to 1.1727 euros. </body>

      <title>Bank of America liable in fraud trial</title>
      <description>Bank of America's Countrywide Financial unit has been found liable for defrauding two government-backed mortgage companies by a US jury.</description>

      <body>Bank of America's Countrywide Financial unit has been found liable for defrauding two US government-backed mortgage companies by a federal jury. Countrywide, which was acquired by Bank of America in 2008, was accused of selling thousands of defective loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The ruling is a major win for the US government, which launched the case in the wake of the financial crisis. The Justice Department is seeking as much as $848m (Â£523m) in penalties. The judge who presided over the trial said a civil penalty will be decided at a later date. A former Countrywide executive Rebecca Mairone was also found liable on a civil fraud charge. She was the only individual to be sued by the government in the case. The month-long trial focused on a Countrywide programme that was internally called "Hustle" or "high-speed swim lane" which allowed loans to be processed quickly without checking their quality. The wrongdoing, which mostly took place before Countrywide was acquired, was discovered after a whistleblower filed a lawsuit against the firm. Manhattan US Attorney Preet Bharara welcomed the ruling. "In a rush to feed at the trough of easy mortgage money on the eve of the financial crisis, Bank of America purchased Countrywide, thinking it had gobbled up a cash cow," he said in a statement. "That profit, however, was built on fraud, as the jury unanimously found. "In this case, Bank of America chose to defend Countrywide's conduct with all its might and money, claiming there was no case here. The jury disagreed," he said. Mr Bharara added that US authorities would "never hesitate to go to trial to expose fraudulent corporate conduct and to hold companies accountable, particularly when it has caused such harm to the public". The US economy witnessed a big boom in its housing market in the lead up to the 2007-08 global financial crisis. As house prices continued to rise, many banks looked to cash in on the boom by creating complex financial products that grouped together home loans. However, a collapse in the housing market saw the value of those investments plummet as the underlying mortgage holders became unable to repay their debts. This snowballed into something called the subprime crisis, which hurt investors globally and caused billions of dollars in losses. Since then, banks have been under pressure to resolve claims on potentially faulty mortgages. The US Department of Justice is investigating at least nine banks over their sales of mortgage-backed securities. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>
      <description>The Liberal Democrats accuse David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announces a review of green energy taxes, but the PM says the move will drive down bills.</description>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for Â£112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average Â£1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <body>Social networking site Pinterest has seen its value jump by more than 50% to $3.8bn (Â£2.3bn) following its latest round of fundraising. The three-year old company, which has yet to generate revenue, said it had raised $225m from a group of investors led by Fidelity Investments. Earlier this year it had raised $200m, valuing the firm at $2.5bn. Pinterest said it plans to use the new funds to further expand internationally and develop its mobile services. "We hope to be a service that everyone uses to inspire their future, whether that's dinner tomorrow night, a vacation next summer, or a dream house someday," Pinterest co-founder and chief executive Ben Silbermann said in a statement. "This new investment enables us to pursue that goal even more aggressively." The San Francisco-based company is also looking at ways of monetising its service. Earlier this month the firm started testing the use of 'promoted pins' as a possible form of advertising. Pinterest has secured its latest round of financing amid renewed demand for fast-growing interest companies. Micro-blogging site Twitter, for example, is looking to raise about $1bn through a share offering later this year. There is strong interest in Twitter, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent years. In the prospectus for its initial public offering, Twitter valued itself at nearly $13bn as of August. In July 2007, the firm was worth about $200,000. Social networking giant Facebook listed in New York last year after raising a record $16bn. The new valuation for Pinterest, which has 46m users, now makes it worth more than some publicly traded tech companies, such as mobile game developer Zynga. But for many analysts, the big question is how the free service can make money based on a business that lets people share images of objects or projects by "pinning" pictures online. </body>

      <body>GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has said its drug sales in China during the July-to-September quarter sank 61% after it was hit by a bribery scandal. Andrew Witty, chief executive at GSK, said it was too early to predict when the business might recover. But he added there was "absolutely no question" of the company pulling out of China. The pharmaceutical giant allegedly used travel companies to channel 3bn yuan (Â£300m) to bribe doctors and officials. GSK admitted some of its executives in China broke the law when Chinese authorities took four GSK employees into custody in connection with the allegations earlier this year. "We continue to co-operate with the authorities and we remain fully committed to supplying our products to patients in the country," the company said in a statement. "At this stage, it is still too early for us to quantify the longer-term impact of the investigation on our performance in China." The investigation into GSK, which is one of Beijing's largest into a foreign company, started in July and also includes other pharmaceutical companies. The drop in sales was bigger than many analysts predicted and hit the company's pre-tax profit - which fell 6% to Â£1.4bn. Mr Witty said the business had suffered most where there had been options from other drug companies. However, GSK predicted its sales growth for the year would be about 1%. The multinational company, which makes Panadol, Sensodyne and Aquafresh among other things, sees China as an important market for future growth. It has a research centre, 7,000 staff and five factories based in the country, although at the moment less than 4% of its sales are generated there. </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments over whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments over whether Detroit city should be granted protection from its creditors. In opening remarks, Bruce Bennett, the lead attorney for Detroit, said there was a "mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city". But representatives for the city's unions and pension funds disagree and say the city is solvent. With $18bn (Â£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. The case to determine whether or not Detroit can continue with its bankruptcy filing is expected to last anywhere from five to 10 days. In opening testimony, Jennifer Green, a lawyer for the Detroit pension fund boards, argued that the city and the state of Michigan had always planned to file for bankruptcy - despite earlier assurances in 2013 that newly appointed emergency manager Kevin Orr would be evaluating all options. As part of the bankruptcy hearing, the unions and pension funds are trying to prove that the city did not negotiate with them "in good faith". If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board. Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, "Down with Orr" and "Orr no more". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support. Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday. Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is "abhorrent" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh. However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour. City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <body>Mobile phone customers will be able to leave their contracts mid-term without paying a penalty if their provider puts up prices, the regulator has confirmed. Ofcom said that customers must be given 30 days' notice of any price rise in their monthly subscription - even if it is within the level of inflation. A provider must then allow a customer to exit their contract without a penalty. Mid-term price rises are allowed, but must be made clear to consumers. There are no specific changes to the rules, but the way they were interpreted has differed among providers. The regulator decided to offer guidance to providers to make it clear exactly how they should behave, and encourage competition. This will take effect in three months' time and will apply to any new mobile, landline and broadband contracts, including some bundled contracts, entered into from that point in time. "Ofcom is today making clear that consumers entering into fixed-term telecoms contracts must get a fairer deal," said Claudio Pollack, Ofcom's consumer group director. "We think the sector rules were operating unfairly in the provider's favour, with consumers having little choice but to accept price increases or pay to exit their contract. "We are making it clear that any increase to the monthly subscription price should trigger a consumer's right to leave their contract - without penalty." The consumer group Which? has campaigned for clarity from the regulator. "Consumers told us price hikes on fixed contracts were unfair, and now people will be able to leave these contracts and switch to a cheaper provider without being hit by extortionate exit fees," said Richard Lloyd, executive director at Which?. Ernest Doku, of price comparison website Uswitch, which could benefit from consumers shopping around for deals, said: "Hopefully it will make providers think twice about increasing prices - they won't want to lose customers two months into a 24-month contract. "But even if this move does not stop prices going up, at least consumers will be able to vote with their feet and say no to higher bills by moving to a new deal." </body>

      <body>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) is expected to roll out the new names within weeks. They are: Ø´Ø¨ÙØ©, the Arabic word for "web"; æ¸¸æ, the Chinese word for "game"; and the Russian words for "online" and "web site", Ð¾Ð½Ð»Ð°Ð¹Ð½ and ÑÐ°Ð¹Ñ. Icann hopes hundreds of new top-level domains will eventually be made. Until now, generic top-level domains (gTLDS) - as they are known - were limited to mostly familiar endings such as .com, .net and .biz. But Icann has decided to open this system up, inviting companies to submit applications for names they would like to register. Firms came forward to request almost 2,000 new names including the likes of .porn, .ninja, and .ferrari. The BBC expressed an interest in .bbc. Google made 101 requests, including .google and .youtube, and also had more unexpected ideas such as .and, .boo, .dad and .new. It will take some time for Icann to process all of those requests, particularly in cases where more than one firm wants to own the same gTLD - such as .music, requested by both Amazon and Google. The most popular domain name was .app - with 13 different companies interested in it. Wednesday's announcement marks the first set of domains in the new system to be approved. "You'll note that all four of these new strings are Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)," said Christine Willett, vice president of the gTLD program, in a blog post. "This will be the first time non-Latin characters can be used in a generic TLD." She added: "The move is an effort to create a more inclusive internet." The new domains will now "proceed to delegation", the final stage before being made live - expected to happen within the next couple of weeks. </body>

      <body>Boeing has announced plans to raise production of its 787 Dreamliner to 12 per month by 2016. That would be an increase from its target for the end of this year of 10 planes a month. The Dreamliner has experienced major problems since its introduction two years ago. It was grounded in January of this year for more than three months while investigators examined why batteries were catching fire. Boeing also reported an 11% rise in net earnings to $1.16 billion dollars for the three months to the end of September. That was better than analysts were expecting and Boeing shares rose more than 4%. The strong performance was partly due to its commercial aircraft division where sales rose 15%. Sales at its defence, space and security business rose just 3% and sales of military aircraft fell during the quarter. "Despite the uncertainty of the US defence market, overall our customer focused business strategies and disciplined execution on our programmes are producing the results we expect," said Boeing's chief executive, Jim McNerney. </body>

      <title>Rent arrears up since benefit reform</title>
      <description>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study.</description>

      <body>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study. The Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR), has published research on the early impact of the measure, which has been dubbed the bedroom tax by critics. It said arrears increased by Â£789,000 in the period to the end of June 2013. It comes against a background of rising arrears in the past two years. SHR said the report, based on feedback from almost 85% of social landlords, gave the fullest available picture of the early effects of welfare reform on Scottish landlords' rent arrears. Iain Muirhead, the regulator's director of strategy and communications, said: "We want to get more information and see a fuller picture before we would draw any firm conclusions on what is happening and why. "Our research establishes a baseline and we will repeat it each quarter and report the findings." But the Early Impacts of Welfare Reform report revealed that the level of arrears had reduced during the period between March and June in each of the previous two years. In 2011 it fell by Â£3.5m and by Â£2.8m in 2012. The report said the total amount owed in rent at 30 June 2013 was Â£63,125,355, although this included amounts carried over from previous years. It said most landlords were facing the same problems in dealing with the effects of welfare reform. They identified increased workload and income reduction as their two biggest challenges. Support, advice and information to tenants featured prominently in the actions landlords were taking to address the early impact. David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the report provided concrete evidence of a worrying trend. "This heralds tough times ahead for Scottish social landlords - be they housing associations, co-operatives or local authorities - as they face the twin challenges of increasing service delivery costs and reducing income. "Both of these challenges arise directly from welfare reform." The benefit changes form part of a revamped system. Under the new housing rules, 14% will be deducted from housing benefit for one "spare" bedroom and a quarter for two or more. The government says the changes should ensure that people are in suitably sized accommodation and release larger accommodation for people who need it. </body>

      <title>'Bags-for-life' could cost extra 5p</title>
      <description>The 5p levy on plastic carrier bags could be extended to so-called 'bags-for-life' raising their price to 15p.</description>

      <body>The 5p charge on single use carrier bags in Wales could be extended to heavy-duty so-called "bags-for-life". Welsh government ministers are considering removing the exemption on the heavier bags. The single-use bag charge was introduced two-years ago, cutting use of the bags in Wales by 90%. Ministers say there is a risk that the heavier bags are now being treated as "throw-away", even though retailers charge between 5p and 10p for them. In their proposals for the environment bill, the government says ministers should have powers to impose a minimum charge on bags-for-life if they believe the sale and disposal of them continues to rise. Recent data has shown the sale of bags-for-life by supermarkets in Wales has more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. In terms of weight, this corresponds to around 30% of the reduction in weight of the thin-gauge single-use bags. In their white paper on the bill, the government says: "An increase in demand for bags-for-life was expected in Wales following the introduction of the charge as consumers got used to reusing their bags and purchased enough bags-for-life for their shopping needs. "However, there is a potential risk that many consumers start treating a low-cost reusable plastic bag as a 'throw-away bag' and discard it prematurely. "This 'substitution effect' is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts if these types of bags are disposed of inappropriately; as such bags are typically made of heavier gauge materials and take longer to degrade." The government has also stated that it will not prevent retailers donating the 5p levy to any good cause, not just the environmental charities that were originally envisaged. It said: "From the information provided by the 246 retailers that have signed up to the code on the Welsh government website and from the retailers' records we have seen, many of the good causes that are currently benefitting from the net proceeds are, for example, cancer charities and children's hospices amongst others. "The Welsh government's stated policy aim in relation to the charge is that it would prefer that environmental good causes benefit from the charge. "However, the Welsh government does not wish to cut across the existing relationships that retailers have with other good causes that contribute to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of Wales." The proposals in the bill come ahead of a review of the current bag charging policy, which will take place next year. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that review will also examine the practices of some retailers. He said: "There is a policy review, which will be undertaken after November of next year, but, certainly, at this moment in time, there are no plans to change the levy. "It depends, of course, on what that review shows and on what we see as the practices of some supermarkets at the moment, which are charging just 1p more for bags for life, thus, avoiding, in some ways, the levy. "We will have to keep a close eye on that, of course." </body>

      <title>Benefit cap 'not achieving aims'</title>
      <description>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its objectives of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its aims of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) looked at the London borough of Haringey, one of four pilot areas. It said just 10% of 747 households affected were known to have found jobs and nearly 50% got extra funds from the council to make up for money lost. Work and Pensions minister Mike Penning said the report was "flawed". The cap, on the total amount of benefits that non-working people aged 16 to 64 can receive, is being rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales - starting in Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley. Couples and lone parents will now not receive more than Â£500 a week, while a Â£350 limit applies to single people. The CIH's research showed that: The researchers said there was evidence that the cap was changing attitudes to employment, but for many claimants there were significant barriers to finding work, such as a lack of job-seeking skills and affordable childcare. Nearly half of capped households claimed Discretionary Housing Payments from the council to help them pay their rent, which the CIH said "both shunts costs between national and local government budgets and masks the true impact of the cap until those discretionary payments run out". Chief executive of the CIH Grainia Long said: "The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving both of those aims in one of the worst affected areas. "There have been whispers that the government is considering lowering the cap or increasing the amount of hours people must work to avoid it. "Unless ministers commit to increasing support for people looking to get back into work and funding for childcare this would be very dangerous." Claire Kober, leader of Haringey Council, said: "Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure. "People still need a lot of support to get training or back into work and spiralling housing costs mean there is a long way to go before anyone could claim the benefit cap is working." However, Mr Penning criticised the report, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't understand why we are looking at something so early on in one very restricted London area, which just happens to be Labour-controlled, which is said not to be working." And the Department for Work and Pensions said the research did not take into account people who were helped to find a job before the cap came into force. "This research relies on early and limited data from a single council and completely ignores the fact Jobcentre Plus has helped 16,500 claimants nationally into work who were potentially affected by the benefit cap. "We do not recognise this report as providing a sound or reliable picture of the reform." The benefits cap applies to people receiving jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, child tax credits, housing benefits and other key support from the government. There is no cap on people who receive Disability Living Allowance or its successor, the Personal Independence Payment, as well some other benefits, such as industrial injuries benefit or a war widow or widower's pension. Haringey Council has said it was given Â£1.8m by the government in the first year to provide discretionary payments and ease cases of hardship. But it estimated that in this year alone it would have to add Â£2m of its own money to pay for the changes, which it said was not sustainable in the longer term. </body>

      <body>UK unemployment and economic output are improving at a faster pace than expected, according to Bank of England policymakers. Minutes from the Monetary Policy Committee's October meeting show that prospects for the rest of 2013 are better than was forecast in August. The minutes show that the MPC voted unanimously to keep interest rates on hold at 0.5%. The MPC noted that business and consumer confidence continued to grow. The UK unemployment rate is currently at 7.7%. In August, when the Bank unveiled its strategy of forward guidance, the rate stood at 7.8%. At that time the Bank predicted it would take three years for the rate to fall to 7%, the rate at which it will start to consider interest rate rises. The October minutes said: "It now therefore seemed probable that unemployment would be lower, and output growth faster, in the second half of 2013 than expected at the time of the August Inflation Report." However, policymakers were divided about how fast productivity would pick up, and by extension, how fast unemployment would fall as the economy recovers. "It was too soon to draw a firm conclusion from recent labour market outturns about the extent to which productivity would increase," the minutes said. MPC members also noted a strengthening in sterling, which would push down on inflation. The Bank's goal is to return consumer price inflation to 2%. Inflation has exceeded 2% since December 2009, and currently stands at 2.7%. </body>

      <title>Bank says Spain out of recession</title>
      <description>Spain's economy has emerged from recession, according to the country's central bank, after growing by 0.1% in the July-to-September quarter.</description>

      <body>Spain's economy has emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years, according to estimates from the Bank of Spain. Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.1% between July and September, the bank said. However, GDP was still 1.2% lower in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Spain's economy has been struggling ever since the credit crisis struck in 2008. The bank's figures are an estimate, and the country's National Statistics agency INE is due to release preliminary third quarter GDP data on 31 October. The Bank of Spain said the country's economy had been helped by stronger exports in the past quarter. "The slight recovery in activity in the third quarter after the fall a quarter earlier is due to... a more favourable contribution from the external sector," it said in its monthly bulletin. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit by the fallout from the credit crisis. The crisis burst the country's housing bubble, and its banks needed government bailouts to survive after being left holding hundreds of billions of euros in bad debts. Its unemployment rate of more than 26% is one of the highest in Europe. Government austerity measures aimed at cutting Spain's large deficit prompted huge protests across the country last year. However, the government recently claimed that the end of the recession was near, saying reforms and austerity measures were paying off. Ignacio del Torre, economist at financial advisory firm Arcano, said: "After recently implemented reforms, Spain has become an export powerhouse. "It will fully leave the recession behind in 2014 with private investment and consumption growth turning positive after three years of decline and credit levels stabilising," he added. </body>

      <title>Australia to raise debt limit by 60%</title>
      <description>The Australian government says it plans to raise the country's debt limit by two-thirds to forestall any concerns it could face a fiscal crisis.</description>

      <body>The Australian government has said it plans to raise the country's debt limit by two-thirds to allay concerns it could face a future fiscal crisis. The newly-elected conservative government is looking to raise the borrowing limit to A$500bn ($486bn; Â£300bn). Australia is forecast to reach its current A$300bn ceiling in December. Treasurer Joe Hockey said that he wanted to avoid a crisis similar to the recent US fiscal emergency. "The debt limit needs to be set so as to provide sufficient headroom to ensure there is stability and certainty for the financial markets about the government's capacity to finance its operations for the foreseeable future," Mr Hockey said. "We need not look any further than the recent events in the United States to realise how imperative for stability and certainty is for confidence." Earlier this month, the US government was partially shutdown for 16 days after the Democrats and Republicans were unable to reach an agreement over the country's budget and raising the debt ceiling. The situation was resolved last week after Congress hammered together a last-minute deal to temporarily raise the debt limit until the end of the first week of February 2014. However, financial markets were rattled by the US political deadlock, which brought the country closer to the possibility of defaulting on its debts. There was little reaction in the Australian financial markets to Tuesday's announcement. Australian government debt is popular among many investors because of its top AAA credit rating. That means it is regarded as the safest kind of investment by the ratings agencies who look at the risks associated with government borrowing, as well as for companies. At the same time, Australia's total debt, expressed as a percentage of its total economic output (GDP), is relatively low compared to other developed nations. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Australia's debt is expected to be around 30% of its GDP this year, compared to 92% for the UK and nearly 106% for the US. Mr Hockey said that the government was keen to keep its debt levels in check. "We are not going to allow ourselves to get into the position that the United States is in where there's tremendous uncertainty about the capacity of a country to live within its means," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott is set to hold his first parliament sittings in late October, which will give the government up to six weeks to pass the legislation required to raise the debt limit. The government is also set to face an audit commissioned by the Treasury, which is aimed at streamlining government services and reducing wasteful spending. </body>

      <title>The tech boss who says it is all about the staff</title>
      <description>A profile of Robert Stanzione, the boss of technology firm Arris, which has expanded greatly under his stewardship.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517646</url>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (Â£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $1.3bn (Â£805m) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>Big retailers are rethinking the way they sell clothing and going for a high fashion rather than a low price approach.</description>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; Â£29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

A statement from the Dairy Council said that the decision had been taken following a "strategic review" of its activities in Northern Ireland. The Dairy Council began sponsoring the tournament in 1983. "This was not an easy decision for us but no sponsorship is permanent," said Dairy Council chief Mike Johnston. The competition's traditional base over the last 30 years has been Coleraine with games also taking place in Portrush, Portstewart, Ballymoney and Limavady. In more recent years, the finals night has taken place at the Ballymena Showgrounds while there have also been games in places such as Cloughmills and Broughshane. Despite Monday's announcement, tournament chairman Victor Leonard told BBC Sport that planning is already well underway for the 2014 competition and that it would "definitely go ahead" next summer. "The future of the Milk Cup is very secure," added the tournament chairman. "2014 will be a very strong event. We are at an advanced stage with teams and actually looking to enhance the event. "The partnership with the Dairy Council has been a very exciting and very beneficial one but we already have some things going on in the background, preparing for this day." However, there is no doubt that the loss of the main sponsor has to be regarded as a blow for the youth tournament. "The Milk Cup has been a hugely important and successful sponsorship for the Dairy Council since we became involved 30 years ago but the market has evolved," added the Dairy Council chief executive, Mr Johnston. "But we need to ensure that our activities meet the needs of the Northern Ireland dairy industry. "We are delighted that over the past three decades we have played our part in making the Milk Cup one of the top events of its kind in the world. "One of the things that attracted us to the event in the early 1980s was the opportunity it provided for local lads to have the experience of playing against teams from other countries and cultures. "At a time when Northern Ireland was in the grip of a dark period in its history and amidst negative publicity in international media, it will always be a testament to the tournament that teams from all over the world were prepared to come to Northern Ireland." Future stars who have played in the tournament include David Beckham, Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Wayne Rooney, Neil Lennon, Joe Cole and Keith Gillespie. </body>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <title>I'll step aside - Kilmarnock chairman</title>
      <description>Michael Johnston says he is willing to step down as chairman of Kilmarnock if the right investors can be found.</description>

      <body>Kilmarnock chairman Michael Johnston says he would step aside from his position if the right investors can be attracted to Rugby Park. Johnston has been under pressure from fans groups to leave the club and was the subject of more protests during Saturday's 2-0 win over Ross County. But he insisted to BBC Scotland that he is open to change. "I'm looking for more local business people to work in partnership for the benefit of the club," said Johnston. "Billy Bowie is the first person since the Moffat family to table an offer of finance." Johnston, who inherited the Scottish Premiership club from the Moffats, revealed that Ayrshire businessman Bowie had invested Â£200,000 in Kilmarnock, with a further Â£1.1m promised. The chairman believes he has more to achieve before leaving Kilmarnock and intends reducing debts of around Â£9m. However, he admitted that, if new investors offer the right money, he would consider his position. Johnston has held talks with the Kilmarnock Futures Consortium and the group is understood to be set to present its takeover plan to the Kilmarnock chairman shortly. Bowie is also believed to be open to working with the consortium headed up by Alan McLeish from the club's kit sponsor, QTS. The 2-0 victory over County was Kilmarnock's first of the season and the first for Allan Johnston, who was appointed manager in the summer. Supporters held up red cards in the 18th and 69th minutes, symbolic of when the club was founded in 1869, in protest at the chairman's running of the club. </body>

      <body>Union leaders are meeting Ineos management later and have said they will offer concessions to try to save the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth in Scotland. The company said on Wednesday it would have to close the plant after workers there rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. John Hofmeister, a former president of Shell Oil and the author of Why We Hate the Oil Companies, told the Today programme's Sarah Montague the news of Grangemouth's closure did not come as a surprised. "By using Brent crude oil, the price of that crude coming into the plant for either chemicals or refining purposes - it is the most expensive crude that's out there, so Grangemouth faces a disadvantage in terms of crude oil relative to other refineries because of the higher price," he explained.

      <description>Straw houses and other secrets of cutting energy bills</description>

      <body>What do an Australian accountant living in south-west London, a 65-year-old sheep farmer in Wales, and council tenants in a rural Lincolnshire district have in common? The answer is a passion for energy efficiency that means that they will not be hit as hard as most by the latest round of gas and electricity price rises. They have built or live in properties where the insulation drastically reduces the need for heat. "You have to plug the gaps, otherwise it is like pouring water into a leaky bucket," says Peter Urquhart, the Aussie who has created an eco home in North Cheam. His project is no grand design, but a two-bedroom, timber-framed bungalow which his neighbours refer to as "the shed". Close to completion in a suburban estate opposite a primary school, only the modern chimneys protruding from the slanting low-rise roof give any clue that this property is different. But inside, skylights mean the rooms are filled with natural light and there is a ventilation system which allows the stale air going out to heat the fresh air coming in. Solar panels lay flat against the roof, creating energy for the underfloor heating. "It is unusual, but it is a home at the end of the day," says 36-year-old Mr Urquhart. The project, he says, took a lot more time, energy and money than he expected. Yet, for him, the reward is displaying an example of what can be done. It is not, he admits, a template for every home in the UK. After all, not everyone has the opportunity to build from scratch, or has the finance to spend upfront. Yet, the Energy Saving Trust says there are small changes that people can make to their homes to make them more energy efficient, and cut bills. They include the use of energy saving lightbulbs, turning off unnecessary lights, setting the washing machine to 30C, or wrapping hot water tanks in decent insulation. Mr Urquhart's motivation was his concern for the environment - a view shared by his wife Lucy. The result is a property which, he estimates, has only a third of the energy needs of an equivalent Victorian home - and 40% of them are provided by the solar panels. The arrival of three-month-old daughter Molly means they have changed their plans to move in, so now they want to sell before embarking on a similar eco home project elsewhere. He is not the only one looking to mirror the design of an energy efficient property. Sheep farmer Anthony Porter has planning permission to build three cottages on his land in the historic county of Radnorshire in Wales. He built the first after reading about American settlers who, despite a shortage of timber, built homes that lasted for more than 100 years. Their, and his, choice of building material was bales of straw. With the price-lifting, profit-making energy industry being portrayed as the big bad wolf, the house made of straw may have worked after all. Lanterns, wind-up torches, a shower warmed by propane gas, and a wood-burning stove nullify the need for mains gas or electricity. The two-bedroom holiday cottage, nestled in idyllic countryside, was built during eight months of huff and puff by Mr Porter and a builder through the winter of 2012. Now it is hired by holiday-makers looking for a break from the gadgets and gizmos of modern life. Mr Porter says it is more fire resistant than a timber-framed house, and carries no greater insurance premium than a standard cottage. The walls are plastered with lime mortar and the roof space is insulated with sheep's wool, meaning the whole building, excluding the land and his own labour, cost Mr Porter Â£31,700. "It was quite a leap of faith," he admits. It was even more of a gamble for the councillors of North Kesteven in Lincolnshire to spend taxpayers' money on building the first straw bale social housing in the country in 2010. But, after looking at the figures, they were convinced it would pay off. The three-bedroom family homes each had a building budget of Â£110,000, which the council says is Â£20,000 less than a brick-built home of the same size. They also feature sheep's wool insulation, solar panels and triple glazing, resulting in an average saving of 44% in running costs, the council estimates. Critics of straw bale homes say that the thickness of the walls means there is less space in the house than with more standard walls. The need to keep them free of leaks and moisture is also vital. More significantly, most homeowners and tenants do not have the opportunity to bypass big energy bills in the same way, especially if they are living in draughty, Victorian homes. While these projects provide an advert for insulation, very few people have signed up to the Green Deal - a scheme in England, Wales and Scotland through which householders can borrow money to install double-glazing, loft insulation, and more efficient boilers. Enthusiasts of self-built homes argue that building a home from scratch means a range of energy efficient installations would be easier to include than in older homes. Self-build is a sector being encouraged by the government with tax breaks, despite the fact that those who want to build their own homes often complain of a shortage of land, planning difficulties, and a lack of mortgage products to finance the project. "With the lack of new homes being built at the moment, you would have thought more lenders would be offering self-build mortgages. Many of the banks and building societies quietly pulled out of the market citing a lack of demand for their mortgages," says Aaron Strutt, of mortgage brokers Trinity Financial. And there is an added irony. The energy companies are suggesting that government-imposed "green" levies are getting more expensive and are pushing up bills for consumers. There is little doubt that before a solution is reached, and before eco homes become less of a novelty, household energy costs will keep on rising. </body>

      <title>Could Concorde ever fly again?</title>
      <description>Could Concorde ever fly again?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24629451</url>
      <date>1382569862</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70641000/jpg/_70641820_183694639(1).jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired, with British Airways and Airbus both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns seven Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for Â£20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering Â£1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for Â£1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about Â£30m a year. That is Â£500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <body>The latest in a series of US sporting exports goes under the spotlight in the UK this weekend, looking to build a fan base and television audience away from its spiritual home. But this is not the latest NFL game at Wembley, rather it is the equally bone-jarring mixed martial arts event in Manchester staged by the UFC, the leading promoter in a sport known in street vernacular as "cage fighting". Casino owner Lorenzo Fertitta and his brother Frank bought the UFC - the letters stand for Ultimate Fighting Championship - for $2m (Â£1.24m) back in 2001. Since then its value has soared and it now generates $500m a year in revenues. From being a sport with a limited TV audience, it is now shown in close to 150 countries, in 28 languages, and broadcast to one billion homes. But why did the brothers decide to buy into a sport that was on the ropes at the time? "It was a combination of business sense and love of sport. I thought it had good business potential," says Lorenzo, 44. He said that coming from Las Vegas, he had seen many great boxing bouts in a city dubbed Fight Town - from Muhammad Ali and Larry Holmes, to the golden era of the late 1970s and early 1980s featuring Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler, Thomas Hearns and Roberto Duran, and then into the Mike Tyson era. "But when I looked at boxing, I felt it was a broken business in many ways, with a short-term vision from a business perspective," Mr Fertitta says. It is a business that has been around for 100 years, makes millions in revenues, but has no real brand value, he adds. "Then we came across the UFC and felt there was value in the brand." He said that the UFC brand had transcended the sport it promotes - mixed martial arts - and that "by establishing regulations, and improving health and safety, we could really build something". "Combat sports are one of the few that can be transferred across a global stage," he adds. "Sometimes sports - cricket for example - just don't travel well. We take two world class athletes, and let them use the martial arts they want." After their purchase, the Fertittas regulated the sport, looked after the fighters, introduced marketing and sold TV rights. In the ring they eliminated the fouls that had caused US senator John McCain to once call it "human cockfighting" - including eye-gouging, groin attacks, and head-butting. "We took a step back, we knew we were dealing with a sport that had a controversial background," says Mr Fertitta. "We crafted rules and regulations. We looked at Olympic Games combat sports, and took the rules and regulations from Olympic boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling, taekwondo, and judo. "That is our sport, a combination of those four. The Olympics defined our health and safety rules." He says that based on revenues and profitability, the UFC brand is now in the top echelon of global sports franchises, alongside the likes of Manchester United, the Dallas Cowboys and New York Yankees. Current big name sponsors include Gillette, Ford, PandG, and Disney. The UFC's core base of fans are males aged 18 to 34, but in some markets, notably Brazil, there is a strong female interest. He says the sport - helped by a strong social-media presence - is creating fans in a different demographic from boxing, which he says is increasingly seen as "your father's sport". UFC mixed martial arts has a healthy pay-TV audience in the US and Canada, and a growing viewership in Brazil, where many of the top fighters are from. In North America the UFC is now looking at establishing its own viewing channels. Whereas previous strategy has very much been aimed at the US, their global ambitions are now turned to Asia and Europe, with BT Sport signed up for regular TV programming in the UK. "Local programming in prime time - that will broaden audience access, and help us break through to our British fan base," says Mr Fertitta. To grow the sport, the UFC a year ago hired Gary Cook - the former chief executive of Manchester City football club - with responsibility for the Europe, the Middle East and Africa region, and whose brief includes getting more coverage on to primetime slots. He is also in the process of organising a series of European fights in major cities such as London, Berlin, Stockholm and Istanbul. Next year, a successful American gym business is also being exported to Europe, where people can practise different martial arts under one roof. There will be a tie-in UFC fitness DVD, and there are also high hopes for an EA computer game coming out early next year. Back in the US, there are a couple of flies in the ointment - the refusal of New York state to sanction the sport, and allegations by some fighters that they are not fairly paid. Mr Fertitta puts the New York impasse down to a dispute about union representation in his Las Vegas group Station Casinos spilling over into the New York legislative process. On fighter pay, he says: "You get paid for performance. You don't hear the guys who are successful complaining. We also have a vibrant 'middle class' of fighters - guys who will never be world champion, but still make a good living." Two of the top fighters competing in Manchester on Saturday, will be in the bout between American Mark Munoz and Brazilian Lyoto Machida, with the latter replacing injured UK fighter Michael Bisping. Mr Fertitta does not believe the British fighter's withdrawal will hit attendances at the Phones 4U Arena event. But he adds: "We don't just want to be another American sport that rolls in and rolls out again, we want to create a truly European sport, with homegrown talent for a homegrown audience." </body>

      <title>Ethiopia's leather industry booming</title>
      <description>Ethiopia's hide industry bids to grow with UK help</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24610075</url>
      <date>1382570080</date>

      <body>Amid the rhythmic clicking of rows and rows of sewing machines, hundreds of workers are busy creating a range of leather gloves, bags and jackets. "I can tell when employees' skills have improved by the noises of the machines speeding up," says Tsedenia Mekbib, a general manager. We are at a busy factory on the outskirts of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It is one of three such facilities in the city owned by UK leather goods company Pittards, which has a long history of operating in the country. While an increasing number of Western firms of all sizes are now looking at doing business in Africa, Pittards has had a 90-year head start. The company, which is based in Yeovil, Somerset, in the south-west of England, has been trading in Ethiopia since the 1920s. And it is all down to a celebrated type of sheep - the Ethiopian hair sheep. This breed, which does not grow a thick coat of wool, also has much thinner skin than its European brethren, making it ideal for delicate leather apparel such as ladies' gloves. Pittards now has ambitious plans to grow its Ethiopian operations, which help contribute towards the firm's Â£39m ($60m) annual revenues. At present its Addis Ababa-based factories and tannery to the south of the city employ about 1,200 locals, a number expected to grow to about 5,000 within five years. A fourth factory has already been built, and is waiting to be occupied. On the current production floors, an element of handwork is also included in the manufacturing process, which each month produces 100,000 work gloves and 5,000 dress gloves. Pittards' Ethiopian factories also produce two million sq feet (186,000 sq m) of quality leather for export to be made into garments ranging from specialist golf gloves to couture handbags. "Ethiopia will grow in importance to Pittards and the global leather industry [in general]," says the company's chief executive Reg Hankey. Ethiopia's attractions for Pittards, and other Western firms, include the country's large pool of relatively low-cost labour. It also has duty-free status for most manufactured products for export to Europe, the US and other countries. Despite Ethiopia having the largest flock of hair sheep in the world - more than 26 million - it is not the largest supplier of skins. Its flock's reproductive rate of about 37% trails New Zealand's 180% and means Ethiopia has only some 9.5 million sheepskins available annually compared with New Zealand's total of about 30 million. Better animal husbandry should increase Ethiopia's supply. Pittards is already involved in environmental programmes to improve the quality of local skins through improved husbandry and treatment against parasites. Another benefit could be improved meat yields, a not insignificant detail while Ethiopia remains a developing country. Regarding the wider issues of doing business in Ethiopia, Mr Hankey says the country faces the same challenges as other developing nations, encompassing difficulties related to bureaucracy, customs and banking. Yet, he adds, while more has to be done, the situation is greatly improved. "Ethiopia has come a very long way over the last 23 years since I first visited, and the last decade in particular has witnessed massive positive changes," Mr Hankey says. "Ethiopia has worked very hard to establish itself as a preferred country for economic development within Africa." Ethiopia's government now wants to grow its leather industry's annual exports to $500m by the completion of its five-year growth and transformation plan at the end of 2015. Leather exports stood at $123m last year. Within Pittards, the British management is happy to be playing a part in Ethiopia reaching its ambitious goal. "We have put down roots," Mr Hankey says. "This changes relationships and thinking - we see things from the inside and the outside, giving us a unique position for further development." Busy at work in the Pittards factory is 20-year-old Embret Beshada. Her job is to sew two glove-shaped panels together while incorporating material to create a thumb casing. She says she found the work easy when she started just over a year ago, despite having to learn many new skills, and was producing gloves within two months. "Being able to support myself excites me the most," she says. Sitting at sewing machines nearby are some of her friends. About 80% of the factory workforce is female, while at the tannery about 80% of the workforce is male. "We are seeing people get more jobs, and people's lifestyles changing, which gives us hope for the future," Ms Beshada adds. </body>

      <title>Why Grangemouth matters</title>
      <description>Why the Grangemouth plant matters to the UK</description>

      <body>Ineos says the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth is to close while the oil refinery will remain open. Around 800 jobs will be affected by the closure. In total Grangemouth employs 1,370 staff and a dispute between union members and staff remains unresolved. The loss of the petrochemicals plant is a major blow and now the focus will be on the refinery which is a key part of the Scottish and UK economy. The Grangemouth refinery supplies 70% of the fuel used at Scotland's filling stations and it also supplies fuel to Northern Ireland and the North of England. Contingency plans are being made to replace petrol and diesel supplies if the refinery closes and experts say that fuel could be sourced from elsewhere. "With petrol and diesel supplies, unless there is panic buying, there should not be a problem as there are plenty of imports," says Alexander Kemp, Professor of Petroleum Economics, at the University of Aberdeen. The number of refineries in the UK has been falling for decades and at the moment there are seven. Coryton in Essex was the most recent to close after its owner Petroplus, filed for bankruptcy in 2012. But analysts say there is still overcapacity in Western Europe and the situation has been made worse recently by cheap fuel imports from the United States. US refineries pay around $15 a barrel less than UK refineries for crude oil, which has helped US firms to export cheap fuel to the UK. But Professor Kemp says there is a longer term issue of energy security for the UK as "we can't always rely on cheap imports of fuel". At the moment the UK imports 47% of the diesel and 50% of the aviation fuel it needs. But for petrol there is currently a 20% oversupply, according to figures from the research group, IHS Purvin and Getz. Its research shows that if two refineries were to close down, the UK would rely on imports for more than 70% of its diesel and jet fuel and more than 20% of its petrol. Grangemouth is an important employer and the 800 jobs lost by the closure of the petrochemicals plant are a big loss. Along with the refinery, Grangemouth employs another 2,000 contractors and the refinery's owner, Ineos, estimates that 10,000 jobs indirectly rely on the site. Due to the refinery and the associated chemicals business, the Falkirk area employs more people in manufacturing than the rest of Scotland combined. "It's actually a fundamental part of the infrastructure of the chemical, petrochemical and plastics industries of the UK and it would be madness to have it shut down," said the local Labour MP, Michael Connarty. But Ineos says the business is losing Â£10m a month and needs an investment of Â£300m. The Forties pipeline delivers a third of the UK's oil output. The steam and power which runs the pipeline and BP's Kinneil terminal comes from Grangemouth. At the moment the supply of steam and power has not been interrupted and Ineos and union workers have been keen to maintain supplies. But if Grangemouth's refinery is forced to close then it is not clear what happens next. A strike at Grangemouth in 2008 shut the Kinneil terminal and that forced 70 North Sea oil platforms to shut down or reduce production. PetroChina owns half the refinery which is operated by Ineos. It can process 210,000 barrels of crude daily. Ineos also owns the petrochemical plant which is due to close. </body>

      <title>'American nightmare' in Detroit</title>
      <description>What happens if Detroit cuts payments to pensioners?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/24633916</url>
      <date>1382542053</date>

      <body>Three months ago, Detroit became the largest city to file for bankruptcy in US history. The trial to determine whether a city of Detroit's size can stop paying its bills will have huge potential repercussions for cities and states across the country. Perhaps no-one is awaiting the trial's outcome as much as Erma and Gordon MacDonald, who have been married for 63 years. "I'm smarter than her," jokes Mr MacDonald, 87. "Only a stupid person would agree to marry me." A jester at heart, Mr MacDonald says people always ask him why he laughs so much. Mrs MacDonald, 82, has an easy answer: "It's so we don't cry." In their tiny one-bedroom flat decorated with photos of their children and grandchildren, the MacDonalds grow silent. They contemplate a future in which the pension that Mr MacDonald earned over 39 years with the Detroit Police disappears - a potential casualty of Detroit's bankruptcy filing. "I don't know what else to say - we're up in the air," Mr MacDonald says. He worries more about his wife, who is in poor health, than about himself. "I take 15 prescriptions," says Mrs MacDonald, "and I kind of jokingly said if they take [my healthcare] away, which pills do I stop without dying?" While it might seem unfathomable that the MacDonalds could face such a choice, the reality is that if Detroit's bankruptcy filing is allowed to proceed, the city will face extremely difficult decisions. Kevin Orr, the emergency manager brought in to run the city by the state of Michigan, argues there is no way forward for Detroit other than through the fresh financial start that bankruptcy brings. The city is anywhere from $18bn (Â£11bn) to $20bn in debt - with $9bn a result of ballooning pension and healthcare costs. It has already cut basic services to the bone, pushing more residents to flee. The city's population now stands at 700,000, down from two million at Detroit's peak. Wait times for emergency calls now top one hour, and less than a third of the streetlights function. More than 80,000 properties have been abandoned. Nature, it seems, moves faster than federal court. Despite all the hardship, those representing the city's pension schemes say a bankruptcy filing would allow the city to renege on promises made long ago. They dispute Mr Orr's calculations, and say it's unfair that the 23,500 retirees who spent their lives working to keep Detroit safe and clean could be left with nothing. "They're taking away the American dream and turning it into the American nightmare," says Donald Hall, who spent 29 years as a detention centre officer and now depends on the $850 he receives from the city every month. There's no question that Detroit is unique among US cities, to fly so high and fall so far, to build landmarks like the majestic Michigan Central Station that less than a hundred years later have the aura of Roman ruins. So then what impact, if any, could a successful bankruptcy filing have on other cities? "On the one hand, Detroit is in an unusual position because it has had massive depopulation coupled with a collapse of the industrial sector," says University of Michigan law professor John Pottow, an expert in bankruptcy law. "On the other hand, Detroit was not alone in making legal commitments to people which it had no funding for." According to a study by economists at Northwestern University, cities and counties across the US have a total of $574bn in unfunded pension obligations. Already, cities such as Providence, Rhode Island, and San Diego, California, have shown signs they are crumbling under the weight of the financial promises made to retirees. "If Detroit is able to file for bankruptcy, then every other big city is going to be watching this," says Prof Pottow. James Canty is a lifelong Detroit resident and manager of the city's parking department. I followed him on his daily rounds as he tried to rid the city of some of the thousands of abandoned cars that line its streets. The job was once done by the police. Now, Mr Canty's team has taken on the role of enforcer in an attempt to free up overworked officers. In neighbourhoods where it's hard to tell which, if any, of the houses are occupied, Mr Canty points to a white Chevrolet sedan with shattered windows here, a pick-up truck missing a wheel there. Frequently, as soon as a tow truck arrives to remove the offending vehicle, the vehicle's owner suddenly appears, as if by magic. The excuses are often similar - what looks like a derelict car is in fact in the process of being mended. It's not hard to see Detroit's financial position in the same way as these dented and decrepit cars - they may or may not be broken, depending on who is looking at them. Is it better to clear the way for something new - or to be forced to fix what only appears beyond repair? </body>

      <description>The Chinese boss who had a novel approach to quality control</description>

      <body>I will never forget my first encounter with the Chinese business leader Zhang Ruimin almost 10 years ago. There, in a glass case in the boardroom of his company Haier was a sledgehammer, not something you normally encounter in corporate surroundings. But Mr Zhang is no ordinary chief executive, as I was reminded in another meeting a month or two ago in his now rather more elaborate headquarters in the Chinese port city of Qingdao. The sledgehammer has been removed to the new corporate museum, something that Chinese businesses are very keen on. But though the story has been frequently told, it is still a good way to explain the remarkable company Zhang Ruimin has created over the past 28 years. The Qingdao Refrigerator Plant was close to failure when Mr Zhang was sent in at the end of 1984. Production at the time was at a low ebb, and there was no money to pay the staff. Mr Zhang borrowed some cash from a countryside workers' co-operative, and set about seeing what could be done about the disastrous state of the company his municipal employers had sent him into. Early notices (now on display in the company museum) banned urination and defecation in the factory. Pretty soon Mr Zhang was confronted with complaints from fridge buyers. In response, he gathered the workers in a yard outside the plant, and in front of them 76 substandard fridges were smashed to pieces. A quality quest to revive the plant started from that symbolic sledgehammer attack. And it worked. Qingdao has historic links with Germany; the city's Tsingtao beer - originally brewed by German expats - is now sold all over the world. So echoing its German partner Leibherr, the fridge business adopted a new name - Haier. Then began a remarkable expansion which has turned it into one of the few current Chinese global brands. With 80,000 employees across the globe, it is now one of the biggest manufacturers of white goods in the world. And when you listen to Zhang Ruimin talking about what he has done, you begin to realise that this is not just a dramatic story about a sledgehammer approach to corporate quality. Using a canny blend of Western management thinking and ancient Eastern ideas, Mr Zhang has created a management philosophy which is deep-seated and far-seeing. At first sight, it might seem to be management jargon plus Confucius, Taoism and Sun Tzu's Art of War all jumbled up. But Mr Zhang has developed some potent insights of his own into how a company might evolve in the face of huge new global challenges. And he is still developing them. "I believe in getting the best of both worlds, both from Chinese culture and from the West," says Mr Zhang. "The good thing about Chinese culture is that it treats something as a whole system, the forest not just the trees. You can see this in the difference of approach of traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine. "Western medicine treats symptoms; traditional Chinese medicine treats the whole body, holistically. Western culture wants everything quantified... so we have also adopted some Western management concepts." "Last week, I was talking to a marketing guru in the US and he told me, 'Good companies meet demands, great companies create demands.' We want to be a great company." Zhang Ruimin set out for me the evolution of his management ideas. "In the 1980s we mostly learned from Japanese companies," he says. "In the 1990s, we learned from American companies: General Electric's Six Sigma insistence on quality, for example. "But now we have incorporated many of those best practices into building our own innovative business model. It's called the win-win model, aligning employee goals with user needs." So (for example) Haier is trying to use the internet to put customers in touch with the people who make the goods, and workers in touch with the product-people who design them. But doing this is hard work. "We're still in a trial and error period and we're still exploring new models," says Mr Zhang. "In the past we had examples to follow but now we are in uncharted territory." Zhang Ruimin calls this "management without leaders". Workers are supposed to be led by the consumers of the things they make. He adds: "The most difficult thing is that in the past the employees would listen to their bosses, but now they don't have any bosses they have to listen to the users." To make this practical, Haier has broken down its 80,000 workforce into hundreds of internal micro companies, each with a profit and loss account even when they are only supplying internal corporate customers. Employees with a good idea are encouraged to find a team to develop it and get it made. Another striking Haier innovation is "catfish management". In fact it's an acknowledgement that there are still leaders even in a so-called leaderless organisation. They may be a bit paranoid, though. It's explained like this: in the sea, a lone catfish creates a commotion when it swims near a school of other fish. Live salmon are transported to market with a catfish in the tank, to keep them active and lively. Haier gives each of its many division bosses a "catfish" shadow manager, who is poised to take over if the man or woman in charge falters. Three months of missed targets, and the catfish deposes the leaders he or she has been shadowing. Sounds ruthless, but the manager (of air conditioners) who I heard from thought it reasonable and even stimulating. Not sure whether Mr Zhang has a catfish, though. When Zhang Ruimin was busy creating waves at Haier in the 1980s and '90s, the great Chinese industrial revolution was changing the whole global landscape. The country was becoming the industrial production house for the world. But most new Chinese companies were making things ordered, devised and designed by Western companies. They made what other people wanted from them. Haier wanted to export its own goods itself... quite a different philosophy, though fridges and washing machines were not exactly state of the art technology. Something else stands out about Haier's export strategy: the company started off in the developed, tough Western markets - Germany, the USA. Mr Zhang says: "Most Chinese companies would choose the other way, the easy markets first and then the more difficult ones later. Many of them started with Africa and South East Asia because those markets had lower expectations of quality. "But we decided to enter the German market first, and people thought we were crazy. "But we tried an experiment. We said, 'Let's put German products and Haier products together and take out the brand and let people see which one is the worst... we hoped it wasn't us.' "We wanted to set the standards high and thus force us to solve all the problems and to meet those high standards. "The Chinese people say, 'If you want to play chess, you need to play it with the master,' because that's the only way you learn." </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24553630</url>
      <date>1382482853</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70648000/jpg/_70648920_70627703.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from Â£2.5m to Â£25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost Â£18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (Â£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [Â£2.5m-Â£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <body>Silk production helped drive global trade, industrial development and social change. But it also shaped one British town that has been home to its production for four centuries. I moved to Macclesfield in Cheshire just over 10 years ago, and it did not take long before the seemingly endless references to silk had me grinding my teeth. From chip shops (the Silktown Fryer) to dentists (Silk Dental Care), the football team (the Silkmen) to the radio station (Silk 106.9), there seemed to be a tedious obligation to be branded with the word. Some businesses got oh-so-clever, with one restaurant changing the I to a Y to make Sylk in order to stand out from the crowd. Genius. Soon, though, the irritation was replaced by curiosity and then fascination as it became increasingly clear just what a profound effect the silk industry had in shaping the town. Many of the old weavers' cottages are still standing, as are a number of the 70-plus mills that once dominated the landscape. I walk my children to school down Lyon Street, named to mark the connection to France's greatest silk centre, while other streets bear the names of the major mill owners whose influence, benign or otherwise, shaped every aspect of the lives of the thousands of people they employed. Silk brought with it regular work, for women especially, and its presence in Macclesfield also heralded the birth of its social infrastructure, as cotton and wool did in other industrial towns. As Prof Jeremy Black from the University of Essex said: "One of the interesting aspects of industrial society, particularly in the north of England, is the development of what we call social capital. The factories and the workforces and the owners are not simply involved in a work relationship, they're also trying to create a new environment - for example, the growth of churches and the growth in particular in education. "By the end of the 19th Century you have great civic foundations with lots of local philanthropy, mostly from the new industrial orders. So what one has is a more purposed social capital, desired and designed to try and improve the nature of society. Whether you were on the left or the right, it ceased to be appropriate to say, 'I want things to be as they were 100 years ago.'" Things really begin to get interesting when you pull back the lens and see just how influential silk has been across the world. Since a Chinese empress supposedly dropped a cocoon into her hot tea and started to tease out the single thread of silk that came loose, the smoothest of luxury materials has provided a status symbol for the rich and powerful. It has also helped play midwife to the anarchist movement in its earliest days, and pushed forward technological change - from the development of arguably the world's first computer, in the shape of the Jacquard loom and the investigation into Mendelian genetics at the beginning of the 20th Century to the creation of state-of-the-art medical implants at the beginning of this one. Silk also provides economists with the earliest model of a globalised industry, according to Debin Ma of the London School of Economics. "There were other materials like coffee and ceramics but these came later. Silk was global early on for simple reasons, especially silk thread, because it's easily packed and bundled, and has extremely high value. In old times when transportation costs were very high and travel very dangerous, if you managed to bring a little bit of silk with you it's very profitable," he said. And these high profits made competition fierce, with the big silk-producing nations often dependent on political disquiet elsewhere for their own well-being. Although silk had been processed in the UK for centuries, it was only once the French revolutionaries banned silk in France that British centres like Macclesfield really had the opportunity to flourish. That is really when the town established itself as the nation's silk powerhouse, with most of the population making their living on the back of it. When Napoleon came to power, however, he rejected the revolutionary puritanism and became a powerful patron of French silk. The resulting downturn in Macclesfield led people there to take their knowledge and skills across the Atlantic and found the American industry in Paterson, New Jersey. The powerful expansion of silk across the globe has been in retreat for some time. Attempts at local production of the raw material, spearheaded by leaders such as James I in England, Henry IV in France and President John Quincy Adams in America, all ultimately failed. Nowadays, most production of the silk itself takes place once again in India and China, though many people there are heading to the cities and turning their backs on the hard labour involved in raising silkworms and harvesting their silk. There are still plenty of people prepared to spend Â£200 for a scarf or Â£90 for a tie made from pure silk, and the luxury end of the market remains resilient. Back in Macclesfield, two companies continue to produce thousands of metres of finished silk products every year, and the connection with the industry that has been here for four centuries and counting helps lend the town a coherence - and for its residents, a meaningful sense of identity. So anyone thinking of opening a bar or a bookies with the word silk in its name - go ahead. I'll be among the first through the doors. Just as long as you don't try to get too fancy and use the letter Y instead of an I. There's nothing smooth about that. Silk will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 23 October at 11.00 BST or listen again on iPlayer. </body>

      <title>UK QE has failed, says QE inventor</title>
      <description>Where did the phrase 'quantitative easing' come from?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24614016</url>
      <date>1382397176</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70618000/jpg/_70618621_qethinkstock.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>When the UK embarked on quantitative easing (QE) in March 2009, in the aftermath of the Lehman Brothers collapse, the Bank of England was expected to administer a monetary stimulus equal to Â£50bn, writes Liam Halligan. Over the past four years, such "extraordinary measures" have extended somewhat more, with the Bank's bond-buying programme now amounting to Â£375bn - almost eight times the original estimate. Since the financial crisis began, the Bank of England's balance sheet has expanded four-fold. But where did the phrase "quantitative easing" come from? Arguably among the most controversial economic policies of recent years, QE is surely the most unpronounceable. Not many Western analysts are aware that this tongue-challenging name originated in Japan, the modern-day spiritual home of money-printing. Even fewer know that the man who coined the phrase comes from Germany - which, of all the big Western economies, has probably the most deep-seated aversion to printing money. In the mid-1990s, Prof Richard Werner, a German academic fluent in Japanese, was working as an economist in Tokyo. Japan's real estate bubble had burst and property and share prices were tumbling. The country was locked in a debate about the use of unconventional monetary policy to support asset prices and boost broader commercial activity. Prof Werner submitted an article to Nikkei, a leading business newspaper, advocating a new type of radical monetary measure. Rather than attempting to shift interest rates, he argued that the country's central bank, the Bank of Japan should instead intervene directly to influence the size of the money supply by taking steps to encourage commercial banks to extend more credit. "I was promoting a policy that involved more credit creation, rather than changing the price of money," says Prof Werner. "So when I wrote my article, and after the newspaper's editors insisted on a phrase readers would understand, I added the Japanese adjective for quantity to the standard expression for monetary stimulation. 'Quantitative easing' was the literal translation back into English of these two Japanese words." Prof Werner's article was widely noticed. Several years later, in fact, the Bank of Japan decided to implement extreme monetary measures and adopted the Japanese name the German economist had coined. "In 2001, the Japanese central bank said, 'Now we're actually doing this'," he recalls. "To communicate this to global markets, they had to give the policy a name in English. I suppose the translators had a bad day, or were under time pressure. Normally, you'd try to come up with something slightly more fluent than 'quantitative easing', but they did only a literal translation." While the Bank of Japan adopted the precise name of Prof Werner's policy, it was somewhat less accurate when interpreting his actual proposal. Incredibly, the Japanese version of QE that was eventually implemented was a policy Prof Werner had specifically ruled-out. Prof Werner's argument was that, because more than 95% of the money supply in a modern economy is derived not from cash or reserves, but from private bank lending, it is essential to get banks to lend. So he urged the Japanese government to enter into private long-term agreements to borrow from commercial banks, instead of issuing government debt. The Bank of Japan's version of QE, in contrast, involved creating money out of nothing at the central bank. "That's absolutely not what my policy was about," says Prof Werner. "In my original article, I specifically argued against either lowering interest rates or expanding central bank reserves. That was my whole point - traditional solutions weren't going to work. Actually, it was a bit upsetting." Then, in an additional twist, the Bank of England also later adopted Prof Werner's QE label - but, again, to describe a policy with which he didn't agree. "It was one thing when the Bank of Japan did it, because that was over in Japan and was some time ago," he says. "But once the Bank of England also started using the phrase, I thought 'Hang on - I've got to speak up and make clear that the original definition is quite different.'" The Bank of England's interpretation of QE also involves the creation of central bank credits, as in Japan. But in the UK these have been used to buy government bonds from commercial banks rather than from the government directly. Prof Werner says this is "a little better" than Japanese QE, as it "at least in theory increases commercial banks' reserves". He maintains, though, that the "best way to boost the economy is to increase bank credit", and that can only be guaranteed by governments borrowing from banks directly. "That creates new credit," says Prof Werner. "The money supply then expands, transactions increase, there's more demand, more employment, more tax revenues and suddenly you have a virtuous circle." In both Japan and the UK, QE isn't working, he says, because it doesn't focus on "the most important part of the money supply", which is bank lending. "UK QE has singularly failed, as bank credit is still shrinking." When faced with the claim used by some British banks that the demand for credit is low, Prof Werner is dismissive. "I'm quite used to this argument, because banks in Japan used it for 20 years," he says. "The banks, of course, have become very risk-averse, as they have many non-performing assets." Prof Werner is also critical of the UK's concentrated banking structure - which he argues has made the economy more vulnerable. "British banking is dominated by a small number of big banks - with just five banks controlling 90% of deposits," he says. "Big banks want to lend to big firms and do big deals that give big bonuses. Small firms are too much hassle, and the banks are absolutely not interested - even though small firms need the credit and account for 70% of UK employment. So these small firms are credit-rationed and that's a problem." "In Germany, 70% of deposits are held by 2,000 banks," says Prof Werner. "These local German banks lend a lot more to small- and medium-sized firms, and when the credit crunch happened most of them were fine." When it comes to QE, although his policy recommendations have been misinterpreted in Japan, the UK and elsewhere, Prof Werner maintains his natural sense of humour about giving the world a phrase that's so challenging to say. "It's become a household name anyway and I should get some kind of fee, some royalties, for that," he says with a smile. </body>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people plan to attend a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed Â£180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <title>'Bags-for-life' could cost extra 5p</title>
      <description>The 5p levy on plastic carrier bags could be extended to so-called 'bags-for-life' raising their price to 15p.</description>

      <body>The 5p charge on single use carrier bags in Wales could be extended to heavy-duty so-called "bags-for-life". Welsh government ministers are considering removing the exemption on the heavier bags. The single-use bag charge was introduced two-years ago, cutting use of the bags in Wales by 90%. Ministers say there is a risk that the heavier bags are now being treated as "throw-away", even though retailers charge between 5p and 10p for them. In their proposals for the environment bill, the government says ministers should have powers to impose a minimum charge on bags-for-life if they believe the sale and disposal of them continues to rise. Recent data has shown the sale of bags-for-life by supermarkets in Wales has more than doubled between 2010 and 2012. In terms of weight, this corresponds to around 30% of the reduction in weight of the thin-gauge single-use bags. In their white paper on the bill, the government says: "An increase in demand for bags-for-life was expected in Wales following the introduction of the charge as consumers got used to reusing their bags and purchased enough bags-for-life for their shopping needs. "However, there is a potential risk that many consumers start treating a low-cost reusable plastic bag as a 'throw-away bag' and discard it prematurely. "This 'substitution effect' is likely to have significant adverse environmental impacts if these types of bags are disposed of inappropriately; as such bags are typically made of heavier gauge materials and take longer to degrade." The government has also stated that it will not prevent retailers donating the 5p levy to any good cause, not just the environmental charities that were originally envisaged. It said: "From the information provided by the 246 retailers that have signed up to the code on the Welsh government website and from the retailers' records we have seen, many of the good causes that are currently benefitting from the net proceeds are, for example, cancer charities and children's hospices amongst others. "The Welsh government's stated policy aim in relation to the charge is that it would prefer that environmental good causes benefit from the charge. "However, the Welsh government does not wish to cut across the existing relationships that retailers have with other good causes that contribute to the economic, social and environmental wellbeing of Wales." The proposals in the bill come ahead of a review of the current bag charging policy, which will take place next year. First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that review will also examine the practices of some retailers. He said: "There is a policy review, which will be undertaken after November of next year, but, certainly, at this moment in time, there are no plans to change the levy. "It depends, of course, on what that review shows and on what we see as the practices of some supermarkets at the moment, which are charging just 1p more for bags for life, thus, avoiding, in some ways, the levy. "We will have to keep a close eye on that, of course." </body>

      <title>WRU to make central contracts offer</title>
      <description>The WRU offers to employ Welsh regions' star players amid financial uncertainty caused by a row over European rugby's future.</description>

      <body>The Welsh Rugby Union has offered to help the four regions keep their leading Welsh players in Wales. The WRU would employ all of the regions' leading Wales players whose deals expire in 2014. Wales captain Sam Warburton is among those out of contract next summer. "It is important that any player considering his future right now fully understands the level of support the WRU is prepared to offer," said WRU chief executive Roger Lewis. The governing body said regions had expressed concerns about their ability to conclude their own negotiations with leading players amid uncertainty over the future of the principal European club competition, the Heineken Cup. The WRU adds that once the negotiations regarding the European tournament are concluded the agreed player contracts would revert to the regions. Its offer came as a European Rugby Cup Limited (ERC) meeting for stakeholders was taking place in Dublin on Wednesday, a meeting representatives of the English and French clubs said they would boycott. BBC Wales Sport understands that Stuart Gallacher, the chief executive of Regional Rugby Wales, the umbrella organisation for the Welsh regions, did not attend the meeting either. Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons have publicly backed Anglo-French plans for a new European competition. They claim the revamped tournament offers "significant advantages", but the WRU opposes the new European competition. Players' agent Tim Lopez, who represents Wales and Lions full-back Leigh Halfpenny, has already warned that some players are waiting to see what happens before deciding their futures. Halfpenny and Cardiff Blues and international team-mate Warburton are out of contract at the end of the season. Scarlets captain Jonathan Davies plus Ospreys trio Alun Wyn Jones, Adam Jones and Ian Evans are also out of contract in the summer. Lock Evans has stated he would consider leaving the region if they were not competing in the Heineken Cup. A number of leading players have left Wales in recent seasons to join richer French and English clubs and the WRU wants to ensure more do not follow. "I want to make it clear to our players that we have full confidence in the future of the elite game in Wales," WRU chief Lewis added. "It would be inappropriate to go into details about any negotiations or discussions which rightly have to be concluded in private. "But I respect the concerns of the players at a time when our talks on Europe are continuing. "Our squad is about to embark on a demanding autumn series of international games and it is vitally important all of their minds are completely focused on the task in hand. "I shared this proposal with the regional chairmen on Monday of this week and look forward to what I expect would be a positive response." </body>

      <title>GPs 'over-prescribe' antibiotics</title>
      <description>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many drugs being prescribed, a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University finds.</description>

      <body>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University. Research showed that for patients with an acute cough the drugs made little difference to their recovery time. Experts have voiced concern that over-prescribing antibiotics helps bacteria become increasingly resistant, making the drugs ineffective. The study involved more than 3,400 people across 13 countries. Since their arrival in the 1940s, antibiotics have been on the frontline of medicine's battle against disease. But experts are warning they are becoming increasingly ineffective at a rate that is alarming and irreversible because bacteria is becoming resistant to them. Researchers at Cardiff and at Antwerp University in Belgium said an acute cough was one of the most common reasons for consulting and for prescribing antibiotics in primary care. Patients taking part in the study were asked if they expected, hoped for or asked for antibiotics when consulting their doctor for acute cough. Researchers found that the recovery time taken for patients remained largely the same, whether or not they expected, hoped for, asked for and/or received a prescription. The study revealed that patient satisfaction with the consultation remained high, whether or not patients actually received antibiotics from their doctor. However, those who had hoped for antibiotic treatment, but did not receive it, were less satisfied. Dr Nick Francis from the Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is also a GP in Ebbw Vale, said GPs prized their relationships with their patients, and may prescribe antibiotics because they feared "bad press" if patients did not get well. "But we are saying you can maintain that relationship by equipping patients with good information about what they should be watching out for," added Dr Francis, who has been a GP for nearly 20 years. "It's a safer approach and they can come back to the doctors once they know what to look out for." Dr Francis said there were also fears that over-prescribing antibiotics could result in bacteria becoming more resistant to them. He added: "The study provides clear evidence that patient views are not associated with illness severity and is therefore unlikely to represent a rational reason for prescribing antibiotics. "Moreover, clinicians are not good at correctly assessing patient views on use of antibiotics. "We believe it is likely that satisfaction could have been increased through enhanced communication, as has been found in previous studies." Last year, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales said increasing resistance to antibiotics could lead to more illness and deaths. Dr Howe said clinicians and patients must accept they could only be used when they had most benefit. </body>

      <title>Conflicting claims over Welsh HS2 cash</title>
      <description>Conflicting claims from Welsh and UK governments about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project.</description>

      <body>The Welsh and UK governments have given conflicting claims about whether Wales has received extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail project. Finance Minister Jane Hutt has told AMs there was a Â£35m budget increase coming in 2015-16 as a result of Â£832m UK expenditure on HS2. But the UK Treasury has denied this, saying HS2 spending is not being passed on. Clarification is being called for amid claims Ms Hutt she may have misled AMs. The issue of whether Wales should receive additional funding from the HS2 rail project has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. It would have meant around Â£35m extra for Wales in 2015-16 and set a precedent for potentially billions more over the lifetime of the project. But the Treasury said the Welsh government's claim was mistaken - and HS2 was excluded from what is known as "Barnett consequentials". Under that process, if extra money is spent on projects in England in services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, Wales receives a slice of extra money too. That process would normally include transport spending - but not in the case of HS2, according to Treasury officials. A UK Treasury spokesperson said: "At the spending round, Wales received Barnett consequentials in the normal way; this excluded funding for HS2. "The government is clear HS2 will be a vital part of our national infrastructure, boosting regional growth across the country and providing vital capacity the UK needs to compete in the global race. "As with any government spending Barnett consequentials will be considered at the next spending review." Plaid Cymru MP Jonathan Edwards said the issue potentially raised questions about the finance minister's competence. The MP for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr said: "For them [Welsh government] to claim that Wales has had a fair share...and for that to be incorrect would be an absolute crisis of confidence I believe in the finance minister." "I've made many comments on the floor of the [House of] Commons that the Treasury is running rings around the Welsh government and if I was Carwyn Jones I'd certainly be asking questions about whether that minister is competent to hold that post," he told BBC Radio Wales. A spokesperson for the Welsh Liberal Democrats said: "It is crucial that the finance minister clarifies this issue as soon as possible because if what the Treasury says is true, the finance minister has misled the finance committee. "Assembly members expect the information provided to them by the Welsh Government to be accurate and correct." Figures obtained by the BBC under a Freedom of Information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose Â£70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <body>A jury in the trial of a former Denbigh mayor accused of causing explosions in the town will return to court later to continue considering its verdict. John Larsen, 46, said he played no part in the explosions in the Lenten Pool area between January and April. He told Caernarfon Crown Court he made fireworks and denied getting a "thrill" from his alleged actions. Mr Larsen denies causing an explosion, possessing explosives and three arson attacks on cars. At the start of his trial, the jury was told that in February this year a series of small explosions occurred in Denbigh which damaged a number of cars. It led to a "main explosion" on 24 March when a device, akin to a bomb, was placed under a Land Rover Discovery in the town. The explosion damaged the vehicle, along with one parked beside it, while ball-bearings and shrapnel from the device were thrown "far and in all directions", the court heard. "Windows were smashed. These events brought fear to the local community," said prosecuting barrister Wyn Lloyd Jones. The prosecution said it believed Mr Larsen was behind the explosions as they stopped after he was arrested on 19 April. The former mayor denies three arson charges, one of causing an explosion and two of possessing explosives - one with intent to endanger life. Mr Larsen said he made "fireworks, not bombs". </body>

      <body>The proposed merger of two Denbighshire Catholic schools could be put on hold as councillors consider a new option. It had been proposed that St Brigid's in Denbigh and Blessed Edward Jones in Rhyl should close, to be replaced by a new multi-faith school on two sites. Instead, Denbighshire councillors will be asked to consider working with the Anglican and Catholic diocese to create a single site on an undecided location. The council's cabinet will vote on the proposal at a meeting next week. More than 1,300 people responded to a consultation, which showed very little support for the original proposals. A new, single site would mean the closure of both existing faith schools, possibly by 2018. Anna Gresty, of St Brigid's Action Group, said: "Having read the council's summary of responses to this consultation, we weren't surprised at the overwhelming response against the proposals to merge St Brigid's School and Blessed Edward Jones as one school 12 miles apart." Tony Hannigan, chair of governors at St Brigid's School, said: "St Brigid's School is very pleased to have been told in a meeting with Denbighshire County Council officers, that they have listened to our concerns and will recommend councillors drop plans for a 'one school on two sites' model involving St Brigid's and Blessed Edward Jones in 2014." However, he said there was concern that plans to build a new school, adding that it would "represent much greater value for money for the taxpayer to use the existing sites and build on their successes". Earlier this year, pupils at St Brigid's made on online film to campaign to keep the school as it is. </body>

      <body>French travellers have left a hospital car park they have occupied since Saturday, blocking spaces reserved for medical staff. The travellers were warned to move from the Royal Gwent in Newport by Tuesday or face legal action. However, some of the 13 caravans remained - and it was only at about 16:00 BST on Wednesday that a procession of vehicles began leaving. One traveller told BBC Wales they had been waiting for a car to be fixed. The travellers, who said they were en route to a funeral, arrived at the 300-space car park on Saturday, taking up 65 spaces. Surgeons, doctors and nurses were turned away from the car park on Monday, but a hospital spokesman said patient services had not been disrupted. After the 16:00 BST deadline passed on Tuesday, Aneurin Bevan University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said it was passing the matter to their legal department. However, hospital security staff remained in place at the car park monitoring the situation until the vehicles began to leave on Wednesday afternoon. A hospital spokesman overseeing the travellers as they left said: "It is good news that the situation has been dealt with peaceably." One of the travellers, Ringo Gogan, earlier told the BBC the convoy stopped in the hospital car park on Saturday because of a problem with a vehicle and were waiting for it to be repaired before leaving for France. </body>

      <description>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm are suspended after complaints about a patchy service.</description>

      <body>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm have been suspended. It follows complaints from ResQNet customers that they had been left with a patchy and inconsistent service. The Cross Hands company has received almost Â£900,000 in public cash from a government scheme to provide high-speed internet access in so-call 'not-spots'. ResQNet vowed to upgrade its network by the end of October. Grants for other broadband providers are not affected. The firm received funding as part of the Wales Broadband Support Scheme, which makes Â£1,000 grants available to households unable to access broadband connections. The money is typically paid directly to suppliers, so residents do not have to pay up front for equipment and connection costs. Customers from various parts of Carmarthenshire have told BBC Wales they were promised broadband connection speeds of around 5Mbps by ResQNet, but say they have faced a disrupted and a patchy service in recent months. John Sydney, from Taliaris near Llandeilo, said he had now cancelled his subscription to ResQNet because of his frustration with the service. He said he was pleased with the internet speed initially being provided by ResQNet, but then the broadband connection deteriorated around six months ago. "We've had very, very slow speeds and a lot of disconnections," he said. "It's on and off all the time. All of a sudden you couldn't do things online... it was quite frustrating." He said the Welsh government "should be checking on the supplier... to make sure he's fulfilling his part of the contract". Another customer, Roger Thomas, from Cwmdu near Llandeilo, has gone back to using an old, and slower service, because he said ResQNet was too unreliable. "Â£24 pounds a months is a lot of money for a service that doesn't work," he said. BBC Wales has been made aware of more problems with services in the village of Llanedi, between Cross Hands and Pontarddulais. ResQNet's own website indicates a series of technical problems and upgrades to the service, while a Facebook page has been set up by frustrated ResQNet customers. The company declined to be interviewed by BBC Wales, but in a statement said work would soon be completed to increase network capacity and upgrades to the wireless network. ResQNet director Clive Downey said that the internet usage they were experiencing was "was way beyond what we expected". In its statement, the company added: "We appreciate there have been service issues on parts of our network due to the increased need for bandwidth combined with the success of the service. "The planned increase in the capacity of the network has been delayed but its implementation by the end of October will help alleviate the current issues for the customers affected. ResQNet said it was a "small, innovative business" that over the last two-and-a-half years had provided broadband services where other "major players have failed". "We are committed to continue this trend and overcome the obstacles that will come along from time to time by continued investment and innovation and provide broadband users in west Wales with real choices," it added. "We are also more aware of its limitations and our business strategy will now reflect this new found knowledge whilst being very aware of the importance this service is to the areas concerned. The company said customers affected by the current issues would be compensated under the terms of their contract, and some had already been paid. The Welsh government said it was "unacceptable" that customers had been let down, after it had paid Â£892,000 in grants to residents and businesses who had identified ResQNet as their broadband service provider. A Welsh government spokesperson said it was working with ResQNet to ensure it fulfilled contractual obligations, adding that there was a "mechanism to recover funding under certain circumstances". </body>

      <body>Around 5,500 rare Arctic charr fish have been released into a Snowdonia lake to help restore their numbers. The Arctic charr population at Llyn Padarn, Llanberis, has been dropping over a number of years with some blaming poor water quality. It is the fourth year that juvenile charr have been released into the lake. In previous years the fish have also been restocked at Llyn Crafnant, near Trefriw, Conwy, developed as a back-up source of charr for Llyn Padarn. However, new stock will not be introduced into Crafnant this year as Natural Resources Wales (NRW) officers are monitoring populations in the lake to see if previous restocking efforts have been successful. "We're committed to ensuring the future of the iconic Arctic charr population in Llyn Padarn and we've put great effort into restocking thousands of fish over the years," said NRW spokesman Tim Jones. "At the same time, we're continuing to work with Dwr Cymru Welsh Water and others to find ways to improve water quality in the lake and create a better habitat for the charr to survive." A breeding programme has been set up at NRW's Mawddach hatchery in a bid to protect the rare fish, which can only be found in a few cold, deep lakes in north Wales. In July a report confirmed that nutrients from sewage effluent had damaged the water quality at Llyn Padarn following an incident in 2009. NRW said the nutrients also caused a toxic algal bloom which closed the lake for weeks at a time. Stricter limits have since been imposed on a local sewage works. </body>

      <body>A man has been arrested on suspicion of indecent assault at children's homes in north Wales. The 66-year-old is being questioned in connection with offences against three boys, between 1975 and 1977, when they were aged between 10 and 14. The man was arrested in St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, as part of Operation Pallial, the investigation into allegations of historical sexual abuse in the north Wales care system. He is the 13th person to be arrested. A 53-year-old man arrested by police on Wednesday, 16 October has been released on bail. The man, from Connah's Quay, was questioned about three alleged sexual offences in the 1980s involving a boy aged between 12 and 14. The National Crime Agency launched Operation Pallial last November to look at allegations relating to 18 care homes between 1963 and 1992. One person has so far been charged with a large number of serious sexual offences. </body>

      <body>People moving into Wales should be more tolerant of the wishes of local people who support wind turbines, an AM says. Dafydd Elis-Thomas, the chair of the assembly's environment committee, was commenting on bitter rows about wind energy plans on the Llyn peninsula. As part of a BBC Wales Taro 9 investigation he says some incomers should "learn to work with" locals. But opponents of turbines say they would be as destructive as the flooding of valleys to create reservoirs. The programme being shown on S4C examines wind turbine developments and proposals on the Llyn Peninsula. Lord Elis-Thomas, who represents Dwyfor Meirionnydd, believes more green energy should be produced, and people moving to Wales should not object so strongly. He told the programme: "I've noticed that there are a number of people who have moved into Wales who vocally oppose stopping Wales developing natural resources and I think this is something very serious. "Because if people move to an area to live, they must learn to work with the people in that area and the economy of this area is vitally important to us all." While some claim wind turbines benefit local communities, the programme also hears from opponents like Sian Parri of the Friends of Llyn Society. She likens wind turbines to the flooding of the Tryweryn valley in the 1960s to provide water to Liverpool. "They say that this is our Tryweryn, and there is no sadder sight in my mind in the history of Wales than that small group of people running down that hill after Celyn Valley had been drowned," she said. "And it will be very sad to come to the Llyn in a few years time with the place destroyed and the views ruined." Others say the divisive issue has far-reaching consequences for a usually tight-knit community. "It's already split long-standing friendships and family ties," said Steve Dorling from Llanaelhaearn. "I can't imagine this proposal is any different to others on the peninsula. "It's very sad when kids that went to school together and are now in their forties and fifties no longer speak and that's the case." Taro 9 can be seen on S4C on Tuesday 22 October 2013 at 21:30 BST </body>

      <title>Ofcom upholds McAlpine complaints</title>
      <description>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom finds both Newsnight and This Morning in breach of its rules, after Lord McAlpine was wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations.</description>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom has upheld complaints against episodes of Newsnight and This Morning which led to Lord McAlpine being wrongly implicated in child sex abuse allegations. Newsnight broadcast allegations against an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years". Lord McAlpine was not named, but was the subject of internet speculation. Days later the prime minister was handed a list of alleged abusers, which named the peer, on ITV's This Morning. The investigation on BBC Two's Newsnight, broadcast on 2 November 2012, looked into allegations of sexual abuse at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wales in the 1970s and 1980s. On the day of the broadcast it had been widely discussed on the internet, with Lord McAlpine's name linked to it. It later became widespread speculation he was the subject of the allegations. Ofcom ruled broadcasting the allegations in this context had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. During a live broadcast of This Morning on 8 November 2012, presenter Phillip Schofield produced a list of people linked to allegations of child abuse, which he said he had put together by searching on the internet. He handed the list - which included Lord McAlpine's name - to Prime Minister David Cameron, asking whether there should be an overarching inquiry into the recent scandal. The list was briefly and inadvertently broadcast by ITV. ITV accepted this was "an uncharacteristic lapse in editorial judgement on the part of the programme's editorial team". Ofcom ruled both programmes had breached the broadcasting code and had treated Lord McAlpine unfairly, causing him distress and embarrassment. Both the BBC and ITV subsequently apologised to Lord McAlpine and paid substantial libel damages. At the time the Tory peer had said it was "terrifying" to find himself "a figure of public hatred". ITV also fell foul of rules relating to providing adequate protection for members of the public from the inclusion of harmful material. A week after the Newsnight investigation was broadcast, Lord McAlpine issued a statement denying his involvement with the claims made by Steve Messham during an interview in the report. Later that day Mr Messham issued a statement saying "the individual concerned" was not the man who had abused him and apologised to Lord McAlpine and his family. That evening, Newsnight broadcast an unreserved apology, accepting the original allegations should never have been made. Ofcom criticised programme makers for not contacting Lord McAlpine prior to the broadcast, when he would have been able to inform them he had never been to the children's home in question. Lord McAlpine also took legal action against some of those who had contributed to the internet speculation. In May this year, the High Court ruled a tweet published by Sally Bercow two days after the Newsnight programme was libellous. The wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow apologised to the peer and said she had accepted a settlement, but the amount of damages was not disclosed. </body>

      <body>The future of a Denbighshire town's community building remains undecided with campaigners vowing to fight plans that would see it demolished. Corwen Pavilion closed in March 2010 because of health and safety issues. Repairs were estimated at Â£1.3m and Denbighshire council planned to demolish it and pass the land to a community group to build a new venue. But the demolition was delayed by a court injunction and the council will now discuss the issue next month. Campaigners from Save the Pavilion say the building has played an important part in Welsh culture throughout the 20th Century. It has hosted several concerts and Welsh cultural festivals. The issue has now been placed back on the council agenda after being held up by legal discussions and other issues. Builder Esmor Davies, a member of the Save the Pavilion group, said: "Nine or 10 months has gone and nothing has been done about it. "It's appalling," he said, adding that the delay would only worsen the condition of the building. Demolition was due in April 2011 but it was delayed by a court injunction to give the campaign group time to come up with a viable financial plan for the building. A court hearing was then due to be held in December 2011 but delayed due to a lack of consent from the Charity Commission. The commission has confirmed it has consulted with Denbighshire council regarding demolition. The council in its role of trustee is now due to discuss the issue again at a cabinet meeting at the end of November. It will then be up to the courts early next year to make a decision. A spokesperson for Denbighshire council said if the court was to side with county officials then demolition could take place as soon as possible. Councillor Huw Jones said the issue should have been sorted some time ago. "It's a dangerous building," he said. "It needs to be resolved as soon as possible." He said Denbighshire council was committed to help provide a new building and that the authority "would not walk away". </body>

      <body>Two masked men who terrified a family in their own home during an early morning burglary have been jailed. Mold Crown Court heard they punched one woman in the face, threatened her and two others at knifepoint, and tried to stab a man with a screwdriver. Heroin addicts Colin Maher 31, and Michael Rhodes, 33, from Rhyl, admitted aggravated burglary at the house in Kinmel Bay. Jailing them for eight years, a judge said it was "the stuff of nightmares". "It understandably had a profound effect on the victims," Judge Rhys Rowlands added. "This was truly a terrifying ordeal at the hands of the two of you." Prosecutor David Mainstone told the court how 20-year-old Chantelle Palmer was staying the night with her parents and a 17-year-old girl was also present. In the early hours of 14 May, Miss Palmer was woken by a bang to find two men in the room - one had a hood covering most of his face and the other had a scarf covering his lower face. Both were wearing gloves, and one stood over her bed three feet away. The intruder looked at her and told her to give him money but she said she did not have any. He then held an eight-inch knife to her throat and again demanded money. Mr Mainstone said the burglar punched her, but she bravely hit him back and there was a struggle. While that was going on, a young woman aged 17 in the same bedroom was woken up to find a knife being held to her throat by the other man. "The knife was thrust at her five times before he punched out at her but she pulled her head away and they didn't connect," Mr Mainstone explained. She heard the first knifeman say that "his boys are outside". Miss Palmer's parents heard a commotion and entered the room. Her mother Ananka Palmer saw a man holding a knife at her daughter and then she "felt an arm and something cold across her neck". "She realised a knife was being held across her throat," said Mr Mainstone. "She pushed the man away with both hands, hard, she saw his face was covered and was terrified. She ran out of the room and was shaking." Her husband Carl Palmer grabbed hold of one of the knifemen and they struggled with each other. The intruder then lunged at Mr Palmer with a screwdriver in a stabbing motion but the householder was able to grab the attacker's throat to prevent him being stabbed, the court heard. It was at that stage that Miss Palmer took the screwdriver away from the attacker and her father was able to pull him out of the house. The burglars then fled in a stolen car. The defendants had been drinking before the burglary, their barristers said. Maher received an additional 18 months in jail for possessing heroin with intent to supply. </body>

      <body>A registered sex offender faces jail after admitting making and possessing indecent images of children. Stephen Meredith, 60, of Four Crosses, Powys, admitted four charges at Welshpool Magistrates' Court. The court heard Meredith underwent a routine check by officers at his home, when he warned them about the contents of his computer. Magistrates told Meredith he faced jail and bailed him conditionally until 14 November for sentencing. Meredith appeared before magistrates on Tuesday and admitted three charges in relation to making indecent images of children. He also admitted possessing indecent images of children. Helen Tench, prosecuting, said that as a registered sex offender, police officers were making a routine check at Meredith's home on 2 May. When they entered the home, he told them he had "something on my computer that's not good", the court heard. Ms Tench said: "Officers sent the computer off for examination and under interview the defendant said he was 'weak-willed' and had nothing else in his life." She said that he had also made obscene internet searches. Ceri Edwards, defending, said Meredith had admitted the charges at the earliest opportunity. </body>

      <body>First Minister Carwyn Jones has backed a health board's plan to postpone some non-urgent surgery at mid and west Wales hospitals this winter. Hywel Dda Health Board said on Monday that certain orthopaedic schedules would be cancelled for a period of time while it dealt with increased pressure. The hospitals affected are in Carmarthen, Haverfordwest, Llanelli and Aberystwyth. Conservatives said the move would have a "massive impact" on patients. The health board said it would review its plans "towards the end of the winter surge". QandA: Hywel Dda Health Board on halting operations The health service union Unison has criticised the move and said that for patients it would result in longer delays and cause "further distress and possibly further complications to their condition". Mr Jones faced close questioning from each of the three other party leaders at First Minister's Question Time on Tuesday at the Senedd. Mr Jones told Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood: "Hywel Dda is doing exactly what her party has called for - that is planning for winter pressures. "It is wholly wrong to say the health board is cancelling all non-urgent elective orthopaedic surgery. "Those who've been scheduled to have orthopaedic surgery will receive it, all cancer, urgent trauma and day surgery work will continue." But in response Ms Wood said Hywel Dda had a waiting time of 15 months for orthopaedic surgery and she urged the first minister "take responsibility" for NHS delays. "Are you aware of the level of outrage amongst clinicians at Hywel Dda, who've been told that they're having a third of their work taken away from them this winter?" she said. Mr Jones told Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams he was informed about the health board's plans the day before it announced them. Ms Williams replied: "It seems that you're not very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter, your government isn't very clear about the LHBs plans for this winter and the public and the clinicians, it seems, are not very clear either." Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said it showed "the government is detached from the reality of what many patients and clinicians are experiencing within the Welsh NHS". Mr Davies questioned whether Welsh ministers were "in the loop" as operations that would have otherwise been scheduled were now being cancelled, decisions that would have a "massive impact on the patient experience and also the ability of that health board to retain its key clinicians". He accused the first minister of being "flippant" in the face of such serious proposals and warned of the dangers of a "crisis situation" developing over the next five months. Mr Jones said Mr Davies was "either setting out to be disingenuous" or wasn't listening to his replies and insisted that what the Conservative leader was suggesting would actually cause a crisis situation. Meanwhile other health boards in Wales have outlined their strategies for coping with winter pressures to BBC Wales. Three boards - Cardiff and Vale, Abertawe Bro Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan - said they would open extra beds, with Aneurin Bevan also promising extra staff. The Cwm Taf and Betsi Cadwaladr boards said they would work with the ambulance service and local councils to minimise the impact on hospitals. Betsi Cadwaladr officials added that the three main hospitals serving north Wales would concentrate on emergencies while non-urgent surgery would be handled by other units. </body>

      <title>Work to prevent village flooding</title>
      <description>Urgent work is carried out to unblock a stream in a small village on Gower to prevent it being cut off by flood water.</description>

      <body>Urgent work has been carried out to unblock a river in a small village on Gower to prevent it being cut off by rising water. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) removed sand from a channel in Oxwich to restore the flow of water. It comes as 13 flood alerts were issued for rivers across south, west and mid Wales following heavy rain. But NRW has reduced these alerts to six and said the weather is expected to improve over the next 24 hours. A team of engineers has been in Oxwich with a digger to remove the sand, which blew in from the beach and is blocking the flow of water from a channel running through wetlands into the sea. NRW said the stream was backing up and threatening to cut off the village. Nick Edwards, senior reserves manager at NRW, said: "The water that flows down from the marsh has been blocked by the large amount of sand that's been deposited by the high tides recently. "If we didn't do this then in 72 hours, I imagine, the road will be flooded." There were reports of surface water flooding in Dunvant, Swansea, and in Pembroke overnight. The Met Office has issued a yellow warning of further heavy rain for south and west Wales on Tuesday. The B4296 at Dunvant Square near Brynaeron in Swansea was affected by surface water, although Mid and West Wales Fire Service said they had not received any calls from the area. Further west, staff at the Field Studies Centre in Orielton, south of Pembroke, reported seeing flooding near their base, including damage to some cars. A BBC weather presenter said more rainfall through the morning could lead to some localised flooding across south Wales, although the rain was expected to turn to showers in the afternoon. She added there was unlikely to be widespread flooding but surface water flooding could be a problem. Looking ahead, there were concerns that further heavy rainfall on Thursday could raise the risk again, with an early warning in place for south and west Wales. </body>

      <body>An 81-year-old church minister has been arrested in south west Wales over an allegation of historical child abuse. Gwyn Ieuan Morgan from Johnstown, Carmarthen, has been suspended from duties at his two chapels pending the outcome of a police investigation but told BBC Wales he was innocent. Dr Geraint Tudur, general secretary of the Union of Welsh Independents, said members were "naturally traumatised". Dyfed-Powys Police said the minister has been bailed as inquiries continue. Mr Morgan has served Bryn Iwan Chapel, near Cynwyl Elfed, and Moreia Chapel in Blaenwaun, north of St Clears, since 1972. Dr Tudur said: "As a charity which offers our members legal and pastoral support, we advised the churches involved to suspend their minister at once, pending the outcome of the investigation. "This advice was immediately acted upon by church trustees. "The church members are naturally traumatised by this development and the union is giving them continuing pastoral support." A statement from the group added: "The union has no power to enforce CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] checks and registration, although it regularly and strongly urges local churches to ensure that the procedure is followed." Dyfed Powys Police confirmed that "an 81-year-old man was arrested in connection with an historic allegation of sexual activity with a minor". "He remains on bail while inquiries continue," the force added. </body>

      <body>Swansea City will once again be without defender Ashley Williams for Thursday's Europa League game against Kuban Krasnodar. Williams has missed Swansea's last five games and has been unable to train because of an ankle injury. The Wales captain is also doubtful for Sunday's home Premier League game against West Ham. "He's still in some pain when he does certain movements," manager Michael Laudrup said. "I already said a couple of weeks ago [that] we are not going to rush it." In Williams's absence Jordi Amat set to continue alongside fellow Spaniard Chico Flores at the heart of the Swans' defence. Laudrup has been impressed with 21-year-old Amat's performances whilst deputising for Williams. "Jordi has confirmed what I already knew and what I expected from him," Laudrup added. "I'm pleased with what I've seen." Left-back Ben Davies will miss the Group A game against the Russian side after being ruled out for up to four weeks with an ankle injury. Winger Pablo Hernandez could return after recovering from a hamstring injury while Jonjo Shelvey and Jose Canas could be recalled in central midfield. </body>

      <body>A grandmother has spoken for the first time about her horrific experience of being dragged under a van during a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Matthew Tvrdon's eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killed Karina Menzies and injured 17 as he used his van as a "weapon" targeting women and children. A year on from the incident, Jill White told BBC Radio Wales she had undergone 13 operations and was in a wheelchair. She had been at a petrol station when Tvrdon randomly attacked. Tvrdon admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained indefinitely under the Mental Health Act in June this year. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. On 19 October 2012, Ms White had been shopping with her mother, her grand-daughter and daughter, and was filling her car with fuel at the Asda supermarket petrol station in Leckwith when Tvrdon pulled up next to her. He left his van and randomly started hitting the side of her vehicle with a steering lock, which led to Ms White's mother suffering a heart attack in the car. "Apparently, I came round the front of the car to look at the damage," she said. "I must have said to him 'What do you think you're doing' and he put his foot down and drove straight at me. "I went backwards... he knocked me straight unconscious. He drove over my body. "My daughter was screaming and running after him. He stopped because people were beeping their horns and trying to stop him from getting out of the garage. He reversed back, my body dropped, and then he drove back over me again." She described how she was still under the van and being dragged out to the main junction as her daughter chased after the van screaming 'my mother's under the van'. "He stopped at the junction and my body dropped and my daughter thought I was dead. She was on top of me seeing if I was alive, screaming. "He came back at the two of us and drove over the both of us, then dragged the both of our bodies a further 50 yards, I think it was." Ms White and her daughter were the last people to be injured during the day's events before police were able to stop and arrest Tvrdon at nearby Llandough. She said her life would never be the same again. Last Saturday a service took place at the Church of the Resurrection in Ely to mark the first anniversary of Karina Menzies's death and the series of hit-and-runs. Ms Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. A memorial party was held last Friday evening by Ms Menzies's sister Samantha who is now bringing up the girls. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <body>Singer Cerys Matthews has staged a concert celebrating Wales' musical heritage to open the Womex world music showcase and trade fair in Cardiff. Some 2,500 delegates are due to attend the event, which runs until Sunday. Treorchy Male Choir, Ballet Cymru and children from Cardiff Bay were among those performing at the Wales Millennium Centre on Wednesday. Matthews, artistic director of the opening concert, said she hoped it would offer "a bit of madness". "The one thing that I love about music is that it's spontaneous," she told BBC Wales. "It's from the heart and it's by people for people - no marketing men, no politics, great sounds and a lot of passion from all the performers and hopefully a lot of enthusiasm from the audience as well." Womex will include performances from around 50 leading musical acts from around the world at the Wales Millennium Centre, along with business meetings, seminars, and a trade fair at the Motorpoint Arena in the city. However a group of Syrian performers - Ensemble Al-Kindi - have had to pull out of a concert on Thursday after being refused entry to the UK. First Minister Carwyn Jones, who officially opened the event, said: "We're delighted that the best from world music has come to Wales this week. "However, Womex also offers a window to the world to hear the very best of Welsh music." Cerdd Cymru Music Wales, which won the bid for Womex to come to Wales, estimated the economic impact of the conference to be around Â£3m. The event has been held at various locations across Europe since 1994, and was last held in Thessaloniki in Greece in 2012. </body>

      <title>Firms still failing over 'swaps'</title>
      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people plan to attend a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed Â£180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <description>Waiting times for cancer treatment improve but health boards are still failing to meet the target for treating the most urgent cases.</description>

      <body>Waiting times for cancer treatment in Wales have improved according to the latest figures. However, all Welsh health boards are still failing to meet the Welsh government's target for treating the most urgent cases. Figures for August show that 88.6% of urgent cancer patients had started definitive treatment within 62 days of diagnosis - up from 84.5% in July. The target is for 95% of patients to see a specialist in that time scale. Conservative Shadow Health Minister Darren Millar said: "Any improvement is a step in the right direction but it is clear that more progress is urgently required. "This is a critically-important target that hasn't been met in five years." Figures for August released by the Welsh government on Wednesday also show 98.5% of patients started treatment within 31 days through the non-urgent route, compared to 98.2% the previous month. There was a small improvement in waiting times for other cancer cases. But none of the six health boards that provide cancer care met the Welsh government's target of providing definitive treatment for the most urgent cancer cases within 62 days. This target has not been met on an all-Wales basis for several years. Kirsty Williams, Welsh Liberal Democrat leader, said: "Being diagnosed with cancer is a terrifying experience. "It is appalling that people are being forced to wait over two months until the start of their treatment." Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones said despite some signs of improvement, waiting times for people with cancer remained "unacceptable". "A Plaid Cymru government would provide all cancer patients with a specialist cancer nurse to guide them through treatment and rehabilitation," she said. A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We welcome the improvement in the number of patients being seen within the target time of 31 days and the continued achievement of this waiting times target. "The 62 day performance continues to improve. There are challenges which LHBs [local health boards] continue to address so that this target can be achieved at a sustainable level. These figures show a move in the right direction." </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <body>Michael Laudrup says Swansea City cannot be complacent against Kuban Krasnodar in the Europa League. Swansea lead Group A with two wins out of two and host winless Russian side Krasnodar on Thursday. A third win would put the Swans on the verge of sealing a place in the last 32, but Laudrup says his side will have to be at their best. "You play in Europe and if you're not 100% you can lose. It's so easy," Laudrup said. Wins over Valencia and St Gallen have put Swansea in a strong position while Krasnodar have not won in their last nine games in all competitions. But despite their opponents' recent struggles, Swans boss Laudrup says Krasnodar cannot not be taken lightly. "If you're not playing your best or nearly your best it's difficult against anyone," said Laudrup. "This team is not a bad team. They have some good players." Laudrup, who had a spell in Russia as Spartak Moscow coach, says victory at the Liberty Stadium would be another step towards qualifying for the last 32. The Welsh side face Krasnodar in the return match on 7 November before games against St Gallen away and Valencia at home in December. "We're at home, we'll be favourites and we're top of the group and want to win for a lot of reasons," Laudrup added. "The first is that getting to nine points will give us one foot, maybe one and a half feet, in the knock-out stage. "After this game we have two difficult away games. "We go to Russia with all the travelling and the time difference, and then Switzerland where there will be cold weather. "We also have Valencia at home so this is a key game for us. "I think 10 points should be enough to get us through, but we might need 11." </body>

      <body>Head coach Iestyn Harris says Wales will have to be at their best to beat Italy in their opening game of the Rugby League World Cup. Wales face Italy at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. England suffered a shock 15-14 defeat by Italy last Saturday and Harris said the result was a warning to Wales. "We knew about the quality of the Italians and we knew they would be a formidable task in our first game," he said. "I think the result they had against England confirmed that. "Italy are a very, very good team and they've got a lot of experience in there [and] they've got a lot of NRL experience in there. "They are an extremely difficult team to play against and anything outside our best won't be good enough to win that game." England face Australia in Saturday's opening game of the tournament in Cardiff followed by Wales' clash with Italy. Saturday's Group C/D match against Italy will be Wales' third game at the Millennium Stadium, where they the lost to New Zealand in the 2000 World Cup and a fell to defeat against the same opponents two years later. Harris is relishing a return to the Cardiff venue and says a successful World Cup campaign could help the game's popularity in Wales. "To have a game at the Millennium Stadium for a Wales rugby league national side is certainly important to us," Harris said. "I'm sure the players who take the field will be immensely proud of the fact that we're at the Millennium Stadium. "If we hit the ground running and get some momentum behind us then all of a sudden the Welsh public will start to get behind us. "That could kick off the sport [and] ultimately we've got that responsibility." </body>

      <title>Crystal Palace plan Pulis approach</title>
      <description>Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish wants to talk to former Stoke boss Tony Pulis after the departure of Ian Holloway.</description>

      <body>Crystal Palace will approach former Stoke City boss Tony Pulis as they seek Ian Holloway's successor as manager, according to chairman Steve Parish. Holloway, 50, left the Eagles by mutual consent on Wednesday, with the club 19th in the Premier League table. Pulis, 55, established Stoke in the top flight before leaving in May - and Parish wants to appoint a manager with experience at that level. "He's never been relegated and he's out of work. We'll look," he said. Pulis was appointed Stoke boss for a second time in 2006 and two years later guided them into the top flight after a 23-year absence. Despite not finishing lower than 14th in five seasons in the Premier League, the Welshman left by mutual consent in the summer after being told the club felt the time was right for him to leave. Stoke's direct and physical style of football often drew criticism from other supporters and managers, but Parish said the Eagles, who play Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday, would approach Pulis about the vacancy at Selhurst Park. "I'm sure we'll try and contact him and if he's interested we'll have a chat with him and see where we go," he told talkSPORT.Â  "But I don't want to put pressure on anybody. We've started making a list, we'll throw everybody into that and see who we want to see." If Pulis does take charge at Palace, he will replace a man the south London club did not want to lose. "I was more than happy to get relegated and come back up with Ian," Parish said. "The word 'sacked' has never been mentioned among the directors. "I've spent three days trying to get Ian in the frame of mind that he can do it against Arsenal. "You'd love to have someone in place next week but I haven't got a list. I wanted Ian to wake up and say 'sorry about the blip' and stay." Holloway guided Palace to the Premier League via the play-offs last season after joining in November, and signed 16 players in the summer. But the only points his squad were able to gain in eight league matches this term came in the 3-1 victory against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 31 August. "All I can do is be as honest as I can and wish everyone at the club well," the former Blackpool manager said. "I need a little bit of time to chill out with the family, but I will look out for Palace's scores." </body>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said billions were being spent administering the scheme. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (Irsas) which are commonly known as swaps. Jacqui Bartels used to run a hotel near Kidwelly, Carmarthenshire, with her husband Adrian. When Barclays suggested she take out an interest rate swap agreement along with her loan she agreed, despite claiming she did not know what the process meant. As interest rates dropped, the charges increased and were soon eating into their cash flow. Like many businesses Mrs Bartels could not buy her way out of the swaps agreement - she would have to pay hundreds of thousands of pounds in exit fees. The hotel went into liquidation. The couple and their three teenage children had to move in with her mother in her two-bedroom bungalow nearby, and have been sleeping on airbeds in the lounge for the last three years. Barclays said: "Barclays has worked closely with the Bartels providing a range of financial support try to help their company through challenging market conditions for hoteliers. "It is in Barclays' interests as well as our customers to complete the review as soon as possible, so we are progressing with it as fast as we can. Where we have made mistakes, we will put them right." Firms still failing over 'swaps' </body>

      <title>Ten of the best: Welsh music history</title>
      <description>What makes Wales' folk music tradition so different</description>

      <body>This week musicians and music industry leaders from across the globe are in Cardiff as WOMEX, the world's leading World Music Expo arrives in Britain. Each evening Cardiff Bay will become the venue for a world music Showcase Festival featuring a tapas of world music from around the world. Folk music played a large part in this year's opening ceremony featuring Cerys Matthews and other leading Welsh musicians taking the audience on a journey of Welsh music and culture spanning 30,000 years. We asked ten of the leading exponents of Wales' folk music to share songs that best represent what makes each tradition so unique. The earliest surviving manuscript of harp music in Europe - the manuscript of Robert ap Huw, comes from Wales. "The tablature of the Ap Huw manuscripts provide a vital insight into early, traditional music and his music is still celebrated and performed widely" said internationally renowned harpist, Catrin Finch. "Caniad Y Gwyn Bibydd" (The Song of the White Piper) demonstrates his music's amazing ability to sound contemporary, even though it was written nearly five centuries ago." This unique tradition of singing or chanting poetry to harp accompaniment is a direct descendent of the form used by early bards to intone poetry in praise of their kings and princes. Gwenan Gibard, a musician and leading exponent of the tradition chose the track Bum Yn Caru Cainc Y Datgeiniad by one of the old style singers, Einion Edwards, from Meirionydd - a stronghold of the tradition for centuries. Considered by many to be Wales's national instrument, the triple harp was brought to Britain from continental Europe in around 1630. It became popular with harpists in London, many of whom were Welsh and brought it to Wales where it became popular amongst the Gipsy community. "The 'shimmering' voice of the Triple Harp's three rows of strings is truly as timeless and unique as the Welsh language itself" said Robin Huw Bowen, a full-time professional Welsh harpist specializing solely in the Welsh Triple Harp. The track Pwt Ar Y Bys (Fingering Vamp) shows off the harp's capability and the Welsh tradition to great effect. In many parts of Wales Christmas Day meant attending an early plygain service between 3-6am at the parish church. Singer Arfon Gwilym was brought up in the tradition and explains more: "The plygain tradition survives mainly in Montgomeryshire and takes place in churches and chapels over a six week period during Christmas and the new year." "After a short service, the plygain is declared open and anyone in the audience can take part, as individuals or as small parties, the most common party being three people, singing in close harmony. The singing is always unaccompanied and in the past was dominated by men who sang in a simple folk style that was unique." Listen to Ar Gyfer Heddiw'r Bore by Triawd Fronheulog. Welsh ballads are still widely performed in their traditional forms but new generations of musicians are revisiting them and performing the songs in more contemporary styles, ensuring they remain relevant. In recent years, folk singer SiÃ¢n James has been at the forefront of this movement: "A ballad which caught my imagination from a very young age was the very beautiful Yr Eneth gadd ei gwrthod (The rejected maiden) - a 19th Century ballad from the Cynwyd area near Bala, which tells the story of a young girl who, finding herself pregnant out of wedlock, is thrown out of her family home by her father, ostracised by her community and left destitute." "It ends with the girl drowning herself. She is found with a water-sodden note in her hand, asking to be buried without a headstone, so her existence would be forgotten." Due to the work of enlightened individuals such as Lady Llanover in the 18th Century, a good many of Wales' traditional dance reels (folk dance and accompanying dance tune type) have survived. Stephen Rees is one of Wales's leading folk musicians and musicologists: "This recording of Pibddawns y Sipsi performed by Nansi Richards, the original 'Queen of the Welsh Harp' conveys the 'hwyl' or spirit of our traditional dance music." During the Industrial Revolution, migrant workers from across the world flocked to Wales' coalfields, slate quarries and docks. The impact on small, Welsh speaking communities was immense and this period ignited a tradition of mixed language songs known as Macaronic. Cerys Matthews is a huge fan and chose CÃ¢n Merthyr as one of her favourites. Initially, Macaronic songs were thought to be an oral tradition but handwritten records do exist in the National Library of Wales archives dated 1909. Its words are said to have been sold on the pamphlet of a ballad-singer at Merthyr Tydfil around the mid-19th Century. The 1960s and 1970s saw a surge in Welsh language activism. While the rest of the western world was engaged in the hippy movement and the 'summer of love', Wales was rediscovering its folk music and traditions, fuelled by a surge in the popularity of Celtic music. "We formed Ar Log in 1976, with the dream of being able to earn a living solely by playing traditional Welsh music" said Dafydd Roberts, one of the founding members of Ar Log. "By the early eighties Ar Log was travelling Europe and North and South America for around nine months of the year with a wealth of traditional Welsh folk music at our disposal, from haunting love songs and harp airs, to melodic dance tunes, and rousing sea shanties." This medley of traditional folk songs comes from Ar Log's own repertoire: Twll yn y to / Cymro o Ble / Pedwar Post y Gwely Dafydd Iwan is a singer-composer and political activist and campaigned during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s for official status for the Welsh language with Cymdeithas Yr Iaith, the Welsh Language Movement. "Songs have been a natural medium for expressing strong emotions and political protest for centuries, and here in Wales there is a long tradition of ballads with a strong social and political theme," he said. Peintio'r Byd Yn Wyrdd (Painting the world green) grew out of the road-signs campaign for the Welsh language. More and more young musicians are turning to the folk tradition for inspiration and helping to drive creative experimentation and collaborations. Welsh poet and singer-songwriter Gwyneth Glyn has recently been working on such a project with musicians from India and singer Tauseef Akhrar from Mumbai and incorporates Indian violin, tabla and Welsh harp. Another recent project entitled Mamiaith (Mother Tongue), saw Welsh folk group 9Bach collaborate with Australian group Black Arm Band to explore the poignant theme of lost language. Gwyneth chose the track Cariad Mam (Mother's Love) from that album. Today, musical tradition in Wales is thriving as younger musicians turn to folk music for inspiration but continue to develop it further with rich musical collaborations around the world. WOMEX - The World's Music Comes To Wales is broadcast on BBC Two Wales, Sunday 27 October at 22:00 BST. </body>

      <title>Wales pool pulled as Paralympic base</title>
      <description>National Pool no longer base for elite Paralympic swimmers</description>

      <body>The Wales National Pool will no longer be the base for elite Paralympic swimmers, the sport's governing body has announced. British Swimming will relocate athletes to Manchester in a move to centralise training after what was seen as a poor performance at London 2012. The Swansea pool board has asked the Welsh and UK governments, along with UK Sport, to get the decision reversed. Its chair Anne Ellis has called it a "significant blow". The Swansea pool has produced medal winning swimmers such as Ellie Simmonds and Dave Roberts. The Manchester pool will be known as the National Performance Centre and the body's new head coach, Rob Greenwood, took up his role on Monday. British Swimming said the move north will give athletes greater levels of support. National performance director Chris Furber said: "A review took place to ensure that we were providing athletes with the best support and services within their daily training environments. "The decision was made, as we move forwards towards Rio [2016 Games], we would have one national performance centre where we will have the very best support and services that athletes require. "We will continue to work with Swim Wales regarding the support that athletes receive in Wales and how we can also support their talent programmes." The South Wales Evening Post newspaper quoted a letter from the Wales National Pool's chairwoman Anne Ellis to politicians. It read: "The decision to stop using the excellent pool facilities in Swansea as a base for elite Paralympics swimming is a significant blow to disability sport provision in Wales." She added this was "particularly disappointing not only because of the exceptional track record developed by Swansea, but also it now means that all elite Paralympic swimmers from Wales will have to travel to Manchester if they want to be in the GB National Squad. "This also means the pool loses out on income from elite training and the coaching excellence developed in the field of Paralympics swimming is under threat." British Swimming's budget was cut after the London Olympics. A spokesperson for Sport Wales said: "Our central focus continues to be that talented Welsh swimmers are able to reach their potential and have access to high level coaching and support. We will be discussing how Swim Wales and British Swimming can achieve this with the help of our investment and resources." Swim Wales said it was "extremely disappointed" with the decision. "Of course we understand that difficult decisions have to be made on how to use limited funding, but the results achieved from Swansea consistently over a number of years speak for themselves, including performances at London 2012 and the recent IPC World Championships. "There is still a key role for Swansea and Swim Wales to play in the disability swimming performance pathway. Discussions are ongoing on how the centre at Swansea fits into these plans leading to the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games." </body>

      <description>Plans for a Â£50m luxury tourist development discarded</description>

      <body>A Chinese company's plans for a Â£50m luxury tourist village in Carmarthenshire have been shelved. Maxhard Ltd wanted to build a 100-bed hotel and 80 holiday homes with a swimming pool on a 22-acre (9 hectares) site near Llandeilo aimed at "a select international clientele". It expected to attract 20,000 visitors a year, but was criticised for its "inappropriate" design. A smaller scheme is being considered but no decision has been made. The developers said they intended to submit revised plans in June of this year, but the scheme's architect Julian Castle told BBC Wales they are no further forward and no revised plans had been submitted. He added the project could "possibly" go ahead or it "possibly won't". "There hasn't been much encouragement from the Welsh government, although there has been a lot of local interest," he told BBC Wales. "At present the plan is on hold and due to the financial climate it's difficult to say whether or not it will be completed." The Llandeilo plan, which included 10 shops and a car park, aimed to create up to 70 full-time jobs. Maxhard, which has offices in London and China, said it would have been a "luxurious development for a select international clientele looking to enjoy a tranquil Welsh retreat". It would have been on the doorstep of Pantglas Hall, where a separate resort offers timeshare log cabins, a restaurant and leisure facilities. Managers of the neighbouring Pantglas Owners' Club had concerns about the scale of the tourist village. Eifion Bowen, head of planning at Carmarthenshire council, said there had been discussions to amend the design. "While the application has been withdrawn, the authority is available at any time to discuss a revised application," he said. A Welsh government spokesperson added: "We had been in discussions with the developer and were awaiting full details of their scheme, which would be subject to usual planning consents." </body>

      <description>Union leaders voice optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant.</description>

      <body>Union leaders have voiced optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant. The Unite union said it had decided to "embrace" a survival plan put forward by owner Ineos, "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs when Ineos announced the closure on Wednesday. Workers had rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Speaking after the talks, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Before the meeting, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union Unite would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Unite remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that Ineos would reverse its decision. The company had previously said that while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael are expected to hold talks at Grangemouth on Thursday afternoon. Mr Swinney had earlier said that he hoped the talks between the management and union leaders would be "constructive and successful" He said: "I hope that at this very, very, very late stage in the process there is a willingness to listen to and to consider the proposals being put forward. "Everybody is agreed that this plant has a strong future with the necessary investment and that is why the Scottish government is willing to be a player in that." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest Â£300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that Â£300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <body>The prime minister's announcement that he wanted to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills was unexpected, Nick Clegg has said. "It's not something that I fully agree with," the deputy prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Lib Dem leader confirmed that the government was to look into whether its environmental policies could be delivered more cost-effectively. They may be funded in future from taxes rather than green levies, he suggested. But he insisted that the coalition's environmental objectives "remain clear and stable". And Downing Street later said work was under way to examine how green levies "can be rolled back from the bills" and paid for by alternative funding. During his Today interview Mr Clegg said in the weeks ahead he and Mr Cameron "will stress-test all these different levies". "If we can deliver those objectives of keeping the lights on, insulating people's homes helping the fuel-poor, supporting the green economy for less, of course I don't want to see an extra penny go on people's bills that is absolutely necessary." But funding for "looking after the environment, securing thousands of jobs in the renewable green sector, and... giving deductions on people's fuel bills for two million of the poorest households in our country" should not end, he argued. This was not the biggest factor driving up energy bills, Mr Clegg added: "In fact, 60% of the increase in energy bills since 2010 have come from wholesale prices." There was, he said, a "big argument" on energy policy, especially since Labour's announcement that it plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if it wins the next general election. "You've got an argument from Ed Miliband, and it is a con, by the way: his freeze would see prices go up, jobs go down, investment go down. "And then you appear to have a new kind of theory emerging from the right of British politics, which says it is all the fault of us caring about the environment. "I don't accept either of those propositions." Mr Clegg also stressed that he was confident he and the prime minister could "resolve" their differences on the policy. On Wednesday at his weekly Commons question session, Mr Cameron told MPs: "We need to help people pay their bills and we need to help to get bills down. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The Liberal Democrats subsequently accused the PM of making a "panicky U-turn". A senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. The Labour leader said that Mr Cameron "was changing his policy every day of the week". "His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him," he added. In a speech later, Mr Miliband is expected to argue that the PM has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy. Mr Miliband will accuse the PM of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs, according to pre-released extracts of the speech. </body>

      <title>Clegg promises 'champion' heads</title>
      <description>Nick Clegg promises to set up a "champions league" of head teachers to be brought in to sort out failing schools in England.</description>

      <body>Nick Clegg has promised to set up a "champions league" of head teachers to be brought in to sort out failing schools in England. In a speech, the deputy prime minister said experienced staff could join a "pool of top talent" which would be "ready to move" at short notice. He also said free schools and academies must only employ professionally qualified teachers. Labour said voters could not trust what Mr Clegg said on this subject. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that unqualified teachers currently working in schools would not be sacked under his proposals, but would instead be given the opportunity to "seek qualifications while you are teaching". He said the rules would not apply to private schools, which also employ teachers without professional qualifications, because "you pay your fees and you take your choice", but children using taxpayer-funded schools had a right to expect basic standards. Before the coalition relaxed the rules, state-funded schools could only employ teachers on a permanent basis if they had completed teacher training, regardless of their other qualifications or experience. The number of unqualified teachers in free schools and academies has gone up from 2,200 in 2010 to 5,300 last year, according to Education Department figures, although the overall number of unqualified teachers in the state sector as a whole has fallen. In his speech, Mr Clegg announced that, from September next year, the government would create a "programme to get outstanding leaders into the schools that need them the most". The team would be made up of head teachers and deputy heads, with recruitment beginning soon, he said. Parts of the Liberal Democrat leader's speech had been heavily trailed in the media for several days, particularly his expression of differences with the Conservatives over free schools, which are state-funded but autonomous. He acknowledged "differences of opinion, some strongly held", stating that his party wants all schools to follow the national curriculum, guarantee food standards and employ only qualified teachers. He said this "view has sparked quite a bit of excitement this week - and criticism", but added that he wants parents to make their educational choices "safe in the knowledge that there are certain safeguards". Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position on free schools, saying that, as recently as last week, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Clegg said: "I am totally unapologetic that the Liberal Democrats have our own ideas." Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Nick Clegg will be judged on what he does, not what he says. "Whatever he says about free schools today, the truth is this divisive policy is his - enacted by his Tory-led government because of his help and support." </body>

      <body>The heads of GCHQ, the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service are to testify in public at a parliamentary committee for the first time. The Intelligence and Security Committee has said it will hear from GCHQ's Sir Iain Lobban, MI5's Andrew Parker and MI6's Sir John Sawers on 7 November. MPs and peers would seek to "give an insight into the world of intelligence, and the work the Agencies do on behalf of the UK", the committee added. The hearing will be broadcast, it said. The evidence session is expected to last for about an hour and a half. In a statement on its website, the committee said: "It represents a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies. "The committee will question the agency heads on the work of the agencies, their current priorities and the threats to the UK. "Among other things it will cover the terrorist threat, regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber security and espionage. "However, since this is a public session, it will not cover details of intelligence capabilities or techniques, ongoing operations or sub judice matters [i.e. those currently being considered in the courts]. "The committee questions the agencies about these details in their closed sessions." The committee would broadcast its proceedings with a delay so that it retained the power to pause transmission of proceedings "if anything is mentioned which might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies", it added. Only parliamentary pass holders and "a small number of print journalists" would be able to take up the "limited number of seats available in the meeting room itself", the committee said. Members of the committee include former cabinet secretary Lord Butler of Brockwell, Labour's former communities secretary Hazel Blears, and ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell. The committee is chaired by Conservative MP and former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind. </body>

      <title>Police watchdog expansion 'on track'</title>
      <description>Police in England and Wales will be overseen by a newly-empowered watchdog and will have to adhere to a code of ethics, says Home Secretary Theresa May.</description>

      <body>A newly-empowered police watchdog will begin investigating complaints against the police next year, Home Secretary Theresa May has said. The expansion of the Independent Police Complaints Commission is "on track", she told the College of Policing. It came after a report by MPs said the IPCC was "overwhelmed, woefully under-equipped and failing to get to the truth of allegations". Mrs May also announced the creation of the first-ever police code of ethics. The plans follow concern over force standards in wake of the phone-hacking scandal, the handling of the Hillsborough disaster, and the sacking of several senior officers. Mrs May said in a speech at the College of Policing that it was "astonishing" the police have never had a code of ethics. She said the college's new code of ethics would be like a "Hippocratic Oath of policing" - setting down standards which all officers will be expected to follow. The college said the code would apply to more than 220,000 police officers and staff across England and Wales. Chief Constable Alex Marshall, Chief Executive of the College of Policing, said: "The code of ethics is a first for policing in England and Wales. "It is a national document reflecting the core principles and standards of behaviour that every member of the police service should strive to maintain. "We do not want this to be 'just another document' for officers and staff to read. "It must be one that is used to help people make professional decisions - to do the right thing in the right way. "It encourages officers and staff to report improper conduct and never ignore unprofessional behaviour by a colleague." The IPCC's expansion will allow it to take on all serious and sensitive allegations made against officers. In February, Mrs May said it would create a stronger and more consistent system of vetting. Mrs May said that some forces, as well as police and crime commissioners, had attempted to resist the transfer of resources required for the IPCC to take on a bigger role. "I want to say to them very clearly that the events of last year prove overwhelmingly the case for a beefed-up IPCC and that is what I'm determined to deliver. "The expansion of the IPCC is on track and the IPCC will begin to take on additional cases from next year," she said. New powers were given to the IPCC before it investigated allegations that police officers were involved in a cover-up of failings following the 96 deaths at the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy. The home secretary said further powers could be given to the commission if required in the future. One in four officers faced complaints between 2011 and 2012. </body>

      <title>Cameron has lost control - Miliband</title>
      <description>David Cameron has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Tories and Lib Dems on energy policy, Labour leader Ed Miliband is to say.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy, Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to say. The Tory prime minister has promised to review green taxes in an effort to cut gas and electricity bills. But the Lib Dems said the announcement represented a "panicky U-turn". In a speech, Mr Miliband will accuse the PM of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs. But Downing Street said the prime minister's green taxes review would help consumers. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks. Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs for 20 months if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, his Conservative predecessor as prime minister, Sir John Major, called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. In a speech in London later, Mr Miliband is expected to say: "Yesterday was the day David Cameron lost control of his government. In weakness and panic, he made up a policy on energy which means business as usual for the energy companies and which is already falling apart. "There is no solution to the cost of living crisis which tiptoes around taking on the energy companies and reforming a broken market. "But this prime minister is too weak to stand up for the consumer and he always takes the side of the big six companies." Mr Miliband will say 27 million households and 2.4 million families would benefit from Labour's promised price freeze. He will add: "Sir John Major recognises that the job of government is to reform markets when they are failing and to protect people. This prime minister does not." But Mr Cameron argues that a price freeze would not work. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, he accused his rival of "acting like a con man". He said gas and electricity bills were at "unacceptable levels" and green taxes were contributing Â£112 a year to the average annual dual fuel bill. But Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary." Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey is due to set out details of the competition review next week. But his party, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, wants to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior Lib Dem source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average Â£1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion, at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Angela Knight, chief executive of the power industry group Energy UK, told BBC Breakfast it was not aware in advance that Mr Cameron was going to announce a review of green taxes. She said: "Statements are made by politicians in the House of Commons and that's absolutely fine but I think it is very much in the interests of everyone that we can get into the details and decide exactly how we are going to proceed with some of these additional costs." While it was not yet clear what exactly the government was going to look at cutting, she said "there are some costs which if they are relieved off the bill then yes it will make a very decent and good difference to households and it will do it quickly". </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for Â£112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average Â£1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>No apology from 'plebgate' officers</title>
      <description>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip.</description>

      <body>Three police officers involved in a dispute with Andrew Mitchell about the "plebgate" affair say they do not owe an apology to the former chief whip. They told MPs that they stood by their "accurate" account of a meeting with Mr Mitchell in October 2012. Mr Mitchell, who resigned over the row, has challenged the officers' claim that he was not open about the incident. But Chris Jones, from West Midlands Police, said he was "not convinced we have done anything wrong". No action was taken against Sgt Jones, Insp Ken MacKaill, of West Mercia Police, and Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police, following an internal review by the forces concerned into their conduct. But the head of West Mercia Police told the Commons Home Affairs Committee the handling of the affair had been "clumsy" and the report and its recommendations should be independently reviewed. However, the chief constables of Warwickshire and the West Midlands said they did not feel the same because they believed the original decisions had been properly reached. Sgt Jones, Insp MacKaill and Det Sgt Hinton's meeting with Mr Mitchell took place weeks after an altercation at the gates of Downing Street where the Tory MP was accused of swearing at police and calling them "plebs" - allegations that he has always denied. In a briefing after the meeting, the officers - all members of the Police Federation - told journalists that Mr Mitchell had refused to elaborate on what he did or did not say during the original incident. Mr Mitchell insists a transcript of the meeting, which he secretly recorded, shows that he apologised for swearing and expressly denied that he had used the word "pleb". Asked by Labour MP Keith Vaz whether he owed an apology to Mr Mitchell, Mr MacKaill said no and insisted he stood by "what I believe was an accurate account of the meeting". He said he believed he had been right to call for Mr Mitchell to resign - believing at the time that his alleged behaviour in Downing Street represented a "casual dismissal of police integrity". Although serious questions have since been raised about the credibility of police reports about Mr Mitchell's conduct, Mr MacKaill said he had "no way of knowing that at the time". Mr Hinton said the three had shown "poor judgement" in speaking to the media immediately after the meeting without time for reflection about what had been discussed. He said he was prepared to apologise to colleagues, the public and "anyone else involved" if the three "may have said things which could be interpreted as being misleading". But he added: "We certainly did not intend to do that and we certainly did not lie intentionally." And he said he believed there was "no conspiracy to unseat" Mr Mitchell. But Conservative MP Michael Ellis, a member of the committee, accused the officers of "disgraceful conduct", saying they had "spun a yarn to the press to get someone out of high office". Mr Vaz said their answers had been "most unsatisfactory" and he would be calling their media adviser, John Gaunt, to answer questions about his role in the affair. Earlier, Chief Inspector Jerry Reakes-Williams, who led an inquiry into the October 2012 meeting and whether the officers had tried to discredit Mr Mitchell, said he believed the trio should face disciplinary action. Mr Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, said the officers' comments to the media "may have had the impact of misleading the public about what happened" as they had given the impression that Mr Mitchell had not sought to explain what happened outside Downing Street. However, he said he did not believe there had been "a deliberate intention to mislead" as there was "some room for doubt and interpretation" about whether Mr Mitchell had given an "absolutely full account" of what took place. He said he believed the officers should face misconduct charges but not the more serious charge of gross misconduct which, if proven, would result in potential dismissal. West Mercia Police ultimately concluded that there was no case to answer for misconduct or gross misconduct, a decision which the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it disagreed with. But Chief Constable David Shaw, head of West Mercia Police, said he now believed the report should be independently reviewed, suggesting the whole episode had been "unedifying" and had damaged public confidence in the police. He also said he had written to Mr Mitchell to offer him a "profound and unreserved" apology for what had happened. Also giving evidence to MPs, the deputy chair of the IPCC Deborah Glass said the transcript and recording of the meeting indicated Mr Mitchell had "answered the questions he was asked". The police investigation had been "thorough and sound" but she believed its conclusions were wrong. "The evidence and conclusions were so at odds that I thought I had to put that on the public record," she said. At the time of the October 2012 meeting, the Police Federation, which represents rank-and-file officers, was involved in a dispute with the government over changes to police pay and employment conditions. Mr Mitchell's friends have accused them of pursuing a political agenda and called for root-and-branch changes to guarantee police accountability. Eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested and bailed over the original altercation at the security gates to Downing Street amid claims that details of the incident were falsified. The Crown Prosecution Service is currently considering charges. </body>

      <title>PM to review fixed odds machines</title>
      <description>David Cameron promises to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from High Street betting shops.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has promised to take a "proper look" at whether high stakes roulette machines should be banned from betting shops. He was responding to a question from Labour MP Tom Watson, who said the "addictive" machines had transformed the "local bookies" into "High Street digital casinos". He called on the government to follow Ireland's example by banning them. Mr Cameron said it was "worth having a proper look at this issue". Fixed Odds Betting Terminals, which allow punters to gamble up to Â£100 every 20 seconds, have fuelled a boom in betting shops on Britain's High Streets. Takings from the machines now account for nearly half of the big bookmakers' annual profits, despite being limited to four terminals per shop. Critics say the machines are highly addictive and lead to crime and poverty but the gambling industry says there is no hard evidence of this and have promised a new code of conduct to allow players to limit their own stakes. Fixed Odds Betting Terminals had been included in a three-yearly review of the last Labour government's 2005 Gambling Act, which also covered fruit machines in pub and cafes, as well as high stakes machines in casinos. But Culture Secretary Maria Miller last month ruled out calls to dramatically reduce the stakes and prizes on the machines, keeping the maximum stake at Â£100 and the maximum payout at Â£500. A separate investigation, by the Responsible Gambling Trust, is being carried out into the potential harm caused by Fixed Odds Betting Terminals and whether they are as addictive as campaigners claim. The DCMS has promised to review the outcome of the Responsible Gambling Trust probe in September, when it could take action to reduce stakes and prizes without passing primary legislation. David Cameron appeared to suggest, at Prime Minister's Questions, that the government could go further than that. He said he had been lobbied by MPs on all sides and said "I do think it is worth having a proper look at this issue, to see what we can do to make sure that, yes, we have bookmakers that are not over-regulated. "But, on the other hand, a fair approach and a decent approach that prevents problem gambling." But Adrian Parkinson, of the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, said he did not hold out much hope of the government taking action before the next election in 2015. "It was a pretty vague answer... but at least it's on his agenda. "Somebody needs to make a decision about what to do. These machines have been around for 10 or 11 years now." The Lib Dems backed calls to give local councils the power to limit the number of betting shops in their area, in a party conference vote last month. The Fixed Odds Betting Terminals issue has also been taken up by a number of MPs concerned about the proliferation of bookmakers in their constituencies, particularly in poorer areas. Tom Watson, who recently stood down as Labour's general election campaign chief, said in a blog for the Huffington Post last week that "these pernicious machines are destroying the lives of the poorest in society". </body>

      <title>Parking ticket 'grace' period urged</title>
      <description>Councils in England should give drivers five minutes grace after their parking tickets run out before fining them, a committee of MPs says.</description>

      <body>Drivers should be given "five minutes grace" after their parking tickets expire before facing fines, MPs on the Commons transport committee say. It also said councils in England should publish annual parking-charge accounts if they want to prove they are not being used as a "cash cow" The Transport Committee warned it was "neither acceptable nor legal" to use fines to increase revenue. Councils made a surplus of hundreds of millions of pounds each year, it added. The MPs urged ministers to freeze charges, currently capped at Â£130 in London and Â£70 outside. Councils said money raised went back into services. Committee chairman, Labour MP Louise Ellman, said: "There is a deep-rooted public perception that parking enforcement is used as a cash cow, so it's essential that local authorities apply stringent transparency." The report said the Local Government Association had calculated a surplus from on- and off-street parking of Â£411m in 2011/12, while the RAC Foundation put the figure at Â£565m. The maximum fixed penalty for speeding is Â£60, unless the case is referred to court. Mrs Ellman argued the charging system was perverse, saying: "Annual parking accounts would allow the public to see how much local revenue is derived from the enforcement of fines, and what proportion of this come from on- or off-street parking charges. "It's right that parking charges be determined locally, but hard to justify fines that substantially exceed penalties for more serious offences like speeding. "Central government should freeze the maximum penalty charge and develop differential fines for less serious parking violations. " Mrs Ellman also said the Department for Transport's rules for councils should include a five-minute "grace-and-favour" period after tickets expire before imposing a fine. A government spokesman said: "We welcome this report, which strengthens the case for changes to be made to parking rules. "The law is clear. Parking is not a tax or cash cow for local councils. This government is reining in over-zealous parking enforcement and unfair parking practices, with the levels of parking penalty charges being kept under review." But Peter Box, chairman of the Local Government Association's economy and transport board, said: "As this report recognises, parking controls are not being used by councils to raise revenue. They are essential for keeping motorists and pedestrians safe, traffic flowing and ensure people can park near their homes and local shops." He added: "Councils always look to be open and transparent with residents on their parking policies. "Any income they make from charges and fines is spent on running parking services, fixing potholes and providing subsidised travel to children and the elderly." Last month, the government said it was considering banning fixed cameras and so-called "spy cars" used by councils to catch people parking illegally. Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, welcomed the idea of getting councils to publish figures, saying it would "illuminate what many drivers regard as the murky world of parking policy". "Parking charges are not inherently wrong but they need to be fair, and where penalties are levied they should be proportionate to the 'crime' committed. "Local authorities are struggling with huge financial pressures but so are drivers. It is unacceptable that car users should be singled out as an easy way of shoring up shrinking budgets." </body>

      <title>Benefit cap 'not achieving aims'</title>
      <description>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its objectives of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests.</description>

      <body>The government's benefit cap will struggle to meet its aims of encouraging people into work and saving taxpayers' money, a report suggests. The Chartered Institute of Housing (CIH) looked at the London borough of Haringey, one of four pilot areas. It said just 10% of 747 households affected were known to have found jobs and nearly 50% got extra funds from the council to make up for money lost. Work and Pensions minister Mike Penning said the report was "flawed". The cap, on the total amount of benefits that non-working people aged 16 to 64 can receive, is being rolled out across England, Scotland and Wales - starting in Haringey, Enfield, Croydon and Bromley. Couples and lone parents will now not receive more than Â£500 a week, while a Â£350 limit applies to single people. The CIH's research showed that: The researchers said there was evidence that the cap was changing attitudes to employment, but for many claimants there were significant barriers to finding work, such as a lack of job-seeking skills and affordable childcare. Nearly half of capped households claimed Discretionary Housing Payments from the council to help them pay their rent, which the CIH said "both shunts costs between national and local government budgets and masks the true impact of the cap until those discretionary payments run out". Chief executive of the CIH Grainia Long said: "The government said the benefit cap would save money and encourage people into work, but this report shows it is far from achieving both of those aims in one of the worst affected areas. "There have been whispers that the government is considering lowering the cap or increasing the amount of hours people must work to avoid it. "Unless ministers commit to increasing support for people looking to get back into work and funding for childcare this would be very dangerous." Claire Kober, leader of Haringey Council, said: "Only a few households have been able to get back into work and, while the government may be making some savings, the real costs are just being passed to local councils already under enormous financial pressure. "People still need a lot of support to get training or back into work and spiralling housing costs mean there is a long way to go before anyone could claim the benefit cap is working." However, Mr Penning criticised the report, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I don't understand why we are looking at something so early on in one very restricted London area, which just happens to be Labour-controlled, which is said not to be working." And the Department for Work and Pensions said the research did not take into account people who were helped to find a job before the cap came into force. "This research relies on early and limited data from a single council and completely ignores the fact Jobcentre Plus has helped 16,500 claimants nationally into work who were potentially affected by the benefit cap. "We do not recognise this report as providing a sound or reliable picture of the reform." The benefits cap applies to people receiving jobseeker's allowance, child benefit, child tax credits, housing benefits and other key support from the government. There is no cap on people who receive Disability Living Allowance or its successor, the Personal Independence Payment, as well some other benefits, such as industrial injuries benefit or a war widow or widower's pension. Haringey Council has said it was given Â£1.8m by the government in the first year to provide discretionary payments and ease cases of hardship. But it estimated that in this year alone it would have to add Â£2m of its own money to pay for the changes, which it said was not sustainable in the longer term. </body>

      <title>Whiplash targeted in car costs drive</title>
      <description>A package of measures aimed at bringing down the cost of motoring, including a clampdown on whiplash-related insurance claims, is announced by ministers.</description>

      <body>A package of measures aimed at bringing down motoring costs, including insurance premiums, has been announced by the government. Ministers have pledged to crack down on the "compensation culture" on claims for whiplash injuries. And there are plans to pilot fuel price comparison signs on major roads and freeze the cost of the MoT test. The statutory maximum price of the MoT test for a car will be pegged at Â£54.85 until 2015. The inflated cost of fuel on major roads is among the most common complaints among drivers. In some areas petrol and diesel can cost 10p per litre more at motorway service stations. The government wants to install a series of price comparison signs which will show the cost of fuel at all petrol stations along any given route. Ministers are also promising to save motorists money by tackling what they call the compensation culture. Independent medical panels will be set up to identify exaggerated or fraudulent claims for whiplash. Currently insurers can make an offer to claimants without a medical report. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: "We are turning the tide on the compensation culture and helping hard-working people by tackling high insurance premiums and other motoring costs. "It's not right that people who cheat the insurance system get away with it while forcing up the price for everyone else - so we are now going after whiplash fraudsters and will keep on driving premiums down." Mr Grayling later told BBC Radio 5 live he wanted any cost reductions from clamping down on whiplash payouts to be used to lower drivers' premiums, rather than boost companies' profits. Labour MP Louise Ellman, who chairs the Commons Transport Select Committee, said she welcomed the package of measures announced, particularly when it came to whiplash claims. "The Transport Select Committee has looked at this over a long time and very recently we recommended that insurance companies shouldn't pay out for whiplash claims without a medical report and that those medical reports should come from independent medical practitioners," she said. "So I'm very pleased that the government have now accepted one of our key recommendations." GP Dr Rosemary Leonard told BBC Breakfast that the UK has a rate of whiplash that is "way higher" than the rest of Europe and "it is thought an awful lot of them are bogus". "If you had a genuinely nasty shunt in your car and you went to your doctor and you said 'Well my neck's aching a bit,' and the doctor just said 'Well actually I don't believe you,' you would quite rightly be very annoyed. "So as GPs we're in this position where we have to go along with what the patient says, because if we don't and it's a genuine case we could be sued." Roads minister Robert Goodwill said: "The costs of owning and running a car are felt by millions of households and businesses across the nation. The government is determined to help keep those costs down." Statistics from the AA show that motor insurance premiums are falling at the fastest rate since 1994 - 12.3% for an average comprehensive policy in the year to October. James Dalton, Association of British Insurers head of motor and liability, said: "We have long called for more robust medical assessment of whiplash claimants. "Setting up independent panels of accredited experts will help the UK shake off its reputation as the whiplash capital of Europe." The moves have been welcomed by the Institute of Advanced Motorists, and motoring organisations the RAC and the AA. </body>

      <title>Major calls for energy windfall tax</title>
      <description>Former prime minister Sir John Major calls for a windfall tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms.</description>

      <body>Former prime minister Sir John Major has called for an emergency tax on the profits of the UK's top energy firms. The ex-Conservative leader said recent price rises of more than 10% were "unacceptable" and action was needed. The government could claw back the cost of extra winter fuel payments through a one-off tax, he suggested. Downing Street said there was no such plan but called Sir John's comments "interesting". Energy firms said they were helping customers keep bills down. Ministers have rejected a call by Labour leader Ed Miliband for a price freeze, describing it as a "con" and urging hard-pressed consumers to switch suppliers instead. Three of the "big six" energy firms - Npower, SSE, and British Gas - have announced plans to raise gas and electricity bills by between 8% and 10%. Analysts expect the others - Scottish Power, E.On and EDF - to follow suit with similar price increases. Speaking at a lunch for political journalists, Sir John - prime minister between 1990 and 1997 - said price rises of this kind were not justified and it would be "entirely reasonable" for the government to impose a one-off levy to recover the cost of cold weather payments this winter. Cold weather payments are triggered when the temperature falls below a certain level for a prolonged period. Those on income support and other work-related benefits are eligible for a Â£25 payment if temperatures drop to zero degrees Celsius or below for seven consecutive days. Fuel poverty campaigners have said the price rises will leave some people with the choice of having to "heat or eat" this winter but energy firms say they are needed to cover the cost of rising wholesale prices and environmental obligations. Asked about Labour's plan for price freeze if it is elected in 2015, Sir John said "Ed Miliband's heart was in the right place but his head has gone walkabout", adding that the plan was unworkable. "But he did touch on an issue that's very important. The private sector is something the Conservative party support but when the private sector goes wrong or behaves badly I think it is entirely right to make changes and put it right. "At the moment I do not see how it can be in any way acceptable that with energy prices rising broadly 4% in terms of costs that the price to the consumer should rise by the 9-10% that we are hearing." He later told the BBC that the was a "crisis" in the energy market and there was a "very real chance" that the government would have to increase the amount of assistance it gave to people in the event of cold snap. Should this happen, he said a "one-off retrospective" tax should be considered "given the scale of their (energy firms') profits and the unjustified nature of the price increases they have just proposed". The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the prime minister and his chancellor were instinctively opposed to short-term fixes and believed only action on competition and supply would reduce bills. But he said intervention from such a senior figure would increase pressure on them to do something. In response to the ex-PM's comments, Ed Miliband tweeted: "Sir John Major makes Labour's argument: David Cameron stands up for the energy companies not hard-pressed families." Shadow energy secretary Caroline Flint said the former PM was "joining a chorus of voices who are concerned about the way the public has been left out of pocket". But she said Labour opposed a windfall tax, as it would be complicated and it was unclear how it would benefit consumers, while a price freeze was a "simple measure" to give consumers immediate respite. The government has said the price rises are "disappointing" but has insisted a price freeze could actually lead to higher prices in the long-term and what is needed is more competition. "There are a number of initiatives that the government has to support vulnerable people, such as the cold weather payments," a No 10 spokesman said. "We have a range of ways in which support is given and those are the right ones." Conservative business minister Michael Fallon said: "It's an interesting idea but we think a faster way to bear down on prices is more competition, simpler tariffs and making it much easier for people to switch to a cheaper supplier." The Energy UK trade association said: "No one should be afraid to put the heating on this winter. If customers are worried they should get in touch with their energy supplier and they should be able to help. "The energy industry is doing an increasing amount to help vulnerable customers and we will be looking at what more can be done to help people worried about their bills." The bosses of the leading energy firms have been called to appear before MPs next week to explain the price rises. Earlier on Tuesday, Scottish Power was told to pay Â£8.5m to many of its customers after being found to have misled them about the benefits of switching to alternative suppliers and other breaches of its licence obligations. More than 140,000 customers on the warm homes discount schemes, designed to support those at risk of fuel poverty, will receive about Â£50 in compensation each. </body>

      <title>'Go home' vans not good idea - May</title>
      <description>Vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK, Home Secretary Theresa May says.</description>

      <body>Theresa May has said vans telling illegal immigrants to "go home" or face arrest will not be rolled out across the UK. A trial of the controversial vans in London is still being evaluated. But the home secretary told MPs she accepted they had "not been a good idea" and were too much of a "blunt instrument". Labour said Mrs May must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the policy. Explaining her decision to ditch the campaign in the Commons, the home secretary said: "What I've done is looked at the interim evaluation in relation to the plans - and there were some returns achieved as a result of that. "Politicians should be willing to step up to the plate and say when they think something actually hasn't been as good an idea, and I think they were too blunt an instrument." But she defended government attempts to tighten up immigration enforcement when people overstay their visas, which she said had resulted in "something around 4,000 people leaving the UK". The government pilot, which saw vans driving around parts of London for a week in July, drew criticism from across the political spectrum. Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable described the campaign as "stupid" while UKIP said the scheme was "disturbing" and reminiscent of a fascist dictatorship. The vans were also criticised by the Advertising Standards Authority, which said the arrest statistics on them were misleading, although the watchdog cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. During the campaign, the vans drove around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow - all ethnically diverse areas where it is thought a lot of illegal immigrants live and work. The poster displayed a picture of handcuffs and read: "In the UK illegally? Go home or face arrest." Home Office ministers insisted the pilot had worked - and they were considering extending it elsewhere. Speaking earlier this month, Police Minister Damian Green said the "hard-hitting" campaign had "let people know that 'the traditional view that if you have been here illegally nothing would happen to you' is not the case". The Lib Dems say they were not consulted about the idea and would have opposed it had they known, and party president Tim Farron has suggested they should take credit for not allowing it to go any further. "This is a failed project and the Home Office should hold their hands up and admit it was wrong both practically and morally," he said. But Labour said it "beggared belief" that the Lib Dems were trying to "claim victory for ending a policy that they signed off in the first place". Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said her Conservative counterpart must take responsibility for the "complete failure" of the idea. "You agreed to that slogan," she said during heated exchanges in the Commons. "And you agreed to send it round communities whose parents heard it from the National Front in the 1970s and whose British citizens work in our public services, build our businesses and fight in our armed forces today. "You signed this policy off, you defended it, all for the sake of one person returning. You should be better than that. I hope you are ashamed of what you did. "You should confirm that you will never pursue such divisive gimmicks again. It is beneath you and it ought to be beneath this government." Conservative MP Henry Smith told the BBC's Daily Politics it had been an idea "worth looking at" but it had been practically flawed and made "people less willing to report if they were in the country illegally rather than more willing". A request by the BBC to see the Home Office's initial evaluation of the pilot has been turned down. The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani requested information about the response to the ad campaign, under Freedom of Information laws. But he was told the details were intended for "future publication" and therefore were exempt from disclosure rules. It is not clear when the study will be published. </body>

      <description>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, ministers from the Friends of Syria group of countries say.</description>

      <body>Syria's moderate opposition should "commit itself fully" to planned peace talks, the Friends of Syria group of countries has said. The talks in Geneva next month offered Syrians the "best hope to improve their lives", UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said. Ministers had gathered in London to meet Syrian opposition officials. A key group in Syria's main opposition alliance has threatened to boycott the planned meeting, dubbed Geneva II. Mr Hague's US counterpart John Kerry said he believed and hoped the meeting would go ahead as planned but that Western countries could not control whether all parties would attend. Addressing the opposition, Mr Kerry said: "You can win at the negotiating table what it may take a long time and a lot of... loss of life to win on the battlefield." Ahmad Jarba, head of the main opposition grouping, the Syrian National Coalition (SNC), said the coalition would decide at a meeting next week whether to participate. The SNC has previously been unwilling to talk to representatives of Mr Assad's government. Mr Hague said the process envisaged by the Friends of Syria involved the establishment "by mutual consent" of "a transitional governing body with full executive powers". Participants at the first round of talks in June 2012 (Geneva I) had sought to end the civil war by getting Damascus and the opposition to choose a transitional government. Mr Hague reaffirmed the view of the Friends of Syria group - Britain, Egypt, France, Germany, Jordan, Italy, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and the United States - that Geneva II must be about a political transition in Syria away from the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Any transitional government could only be agreed with the consent of the SNC, and therefore Mr Assad would play no role in it, Mr Hague added. Mr Kerry said he expected representatives of the government to attend any talks and to "negotiate in good faith". Mr Hague and Mr Kerry also pledged further backing for Syria's moderate opposition, aimed at bolstering them in the face of rising influence extremists from power in the war-gripped country. Mr Jarba also spoke to reporters after the meeting, outlining the steps that he considered necessary for the success of the Geneva talks, including: Iran as yet has no role in Geneva II, but Mr Hague earlier told the BBC he was trying to use new positive diplomatic relations with Iran to encourage it to play a "more constructive role". Also on Tuesday, the UN Special Co-ordinator for the mission to destroy Syria's chemical weapons, Sigrid Kaag, said in a statement that to date, the Syrian government had "fully co-operated" in the mission's work. Western officials have been buoyed by the initial results of the chemical disarmament effort, the BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus says. But he adds that they are painfully aware that the recent chemical deal has done nothing to alter the course of the civil war or to reduce the burgeoning humanitarian catastrophe in and around Syria. On Monday, Mr Assad told Lebanon's al-Mayadeen television that he saw no reason why he could not run for the presidency again in 2014. "Personally, I don't see any obstacles to being nominated to run in the next presidential elections," he was quoted as saying by the channel. Mr Assad told the channel that his government would take part in the conference without preconditions, but suggested the prospects that it would reach a settlement were, at present, dim. "No time has been set, and the factors are not yet in place if we want to succeed," he told al-Mayadeen. "Which forces are taking part? What relation do these forces have with the Syrian people? Do these forces represent the Syrian people, or do they represent the states that invented them?" he asked. Saudi Arabia and Qatar are key funders of opposition forces in Syria, including, it is believed, hardline Islamist groups. After Tuesday's meeting, Mr Kerry was asked about reports quoting the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, as saying his country would make a "major shift" in its relations with the US because of Saudi impatience with perceived Western inaction on Syria. Mr Kerry played down the report, insisting the two countries were "on the same page". More than 100,000 people have been killed since the Syrian conflict began in 2011. The UN estimates that by the end of 2014 more than eight million Syrians could have been forced from their homes, including 5.2 million who will have fled the country. </body>

      <title>'Plebgate has hit trust' in police</title>
      <description>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police after accusations of misconduct by officers in the "Plebgate" row, a poll for the BBC finds.</description>

      <body>One in four people say they are "less likely" to trust police in the wake of "Plebgate", a poll for the BBC found. Despite accusations officers lied to undermine then cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell, the ComRes survey of 1,000 people found 82% are still likely to believe what the police say. Mr Mitchell has denied calling police "plebs" outside Downing Street. Officers from the police union in his constituency have apologised for "poor judgement" over the affair. The apology came after a transcript emerged of a meeting they had attended with Mr Mitchell, then government chief whip. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has said the officers misrepresented him at a press conference after the meeting, which the minister had called to defuse the row with police. The BBC's poll asked how the affair had affected people's "opinion" of the police. While 67% said it had made "no difference", 26% responded that it had made them "slightly less" or "much less" likely to trust the police. Only 5% said the affair had increased their trust in the police. The poll suggests public trust overall remains high, with 82% saying they were "very likely" or "fairly likely" to believe officers speaking either on television or on the streets while on duty. But it found that 40% agreed with the statement: "Generally, the police seem to try to cover up wrongdoing by those in its ranks." And in Mr Mitchell's West Midlands region as well as in Scotland and among skilled manual workers, overall trust was fractionally lower, with one in five saying they were unlikely to believe what officers say. The three officers accused by the IPCC of having tried to discredit Mr Mitchell are due to appear before MPs on the influential Home Affairs Select Committee on Wednesday. The inspector who investigated the comments made by the officers after the meeting has also been called to appear. But the Police and Crime Commissioner for one of the forces concerned accused friends of the ex-minister of "baying for blood" over the affair. Warwickshire PCC Ron Ball said Mr Mitchell and his supporters should have accepted the Police Federation's apology. Conservative backbencher David Davis has said the officers should "face the consequences" of what he described as their "deliberate misconduct". </body>

      <description>Facebook adds warning signs to videos of beheadings and other instances of graphic violence, but its safety advisors still have concerns.</description>

      <body>Facebook has begun adding warning messages to videos on its site showing decapitations and other instances of extreme violence. The alert states: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." The move follows its decision to allow the clips to be posted to its site following a temporary ban on the material, introduced in May. The prime minister and Facebook's own advisors had criticised the decision. The social network said that it wished to allow its users - who can be as young as 13 - to share and condemn the material. It added that it would continue to block clips if the original poster glorified or celebrated the violence shown. On Monday the firm said it might, in time, add warnings or other controls, but initially allowed a recently uploaded decapitation clip to appear unaltered. This prompted David Cameron to tweet: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." US charity the Family Online Safety Institute - a member of the social network's Safety Advisory Board - also raised concern saying it had not been alerted to the change of policy despite previously stating such videos "crossed the line". A spokeswoman for Facebook declined to comment about its latest move. She had previously defended its decision to allow a video showing a woman being beheaded - believed to have been filmed in Mexico - to be shared despite the fact it bans images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". "Facebook has long been a place where people turn to share their experiences, particularly when they're connected to controversial events on the ground, such as human rights abuses, acts of terrorism and other violent events," she said. "People are sharing this video on Facebook to condemn it. If the video were being celebrated, or the actions in it encouraged, our approach would be different." A UK member of Facebook's Safety Advisory Board said he still had concerns despite the addition of the warnings. "It's a step forward but it's still horrific content," said Will Gardner, chief executive of Childnet. He added that he needed to look into the changes before commenting further. Until Monday Facebook had also featured adverts alongside the video of the Mexican murder despite the fact several users had complained to it about the material. Car-sharing firm Zipcar, whose service was one of those shown, said it was disappointed by the discovery. "We want you to know that we do not condone this type of abhorrent content being circulated on Facebook," it said in a statement. "We have expressed to Facebook in the past the critical need to block offensive content from appearing and we will continue to engage with them on this important matter." Facebook has since disabled Zipcar and other firms' ads from appearing on the page in question. One of the Facebook accounts that had requested the death video be removed belongs to the South Australia Police force (Sapol). It said it had been contacted by a member of its local community about the matter. Shelaye Boothey, director of Sapol's media and public engagement section, told the BBC: "Ultimately this is a decision that Facebook is entitled to make, however anyone concerned with the publishing of the video should continue to express their concerns through the appropriate Facebook channels." Hostage UK - a charity that supports kidnap victims and their families - added that it was also urging Facebook to reconsider its decision. "We know first-hand the acute distress these videos and images cause and we stress that this continues to be a source of worry to the families of today's hostages," it said. "We can see no useful purpose being served by the decision to make such recordings available. The public are well aware of the brutalities committed and a public showing of such material adds nothing, other than cause further unimaginable suffering." However, some freedom of speech campaigners believe that Facebook should not block the videos, even if they do celebrate the violence contained. French digital rights group La Quadrature Du Net described the actions as "privatised censorship". "It plays a profoundly anti-democratic role when it makes any such choice, whatever the limits are and whatever the good reasons it uses to make the decision," said the organisation's co-founder Jeremie Zimmermann. </body>

      <title>Would-be MPs 'should be vetted'</title>
      <description>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, says former Cabinet Secretary Lord O'Donnell.</description>

      <body>Would-be MPs should be forced to meet "pre-qualification criteria" before being allowed to stand, a former cabinet secretary has suggested. Lord O'Donnell - once the UK's most senior civil servant - said the idea could make Parliament more effective. Government policies would also be vetted by former ministers, accountants and ex-civil servants under Lord O'Donnell's proposals. He said radical change was needed as the country was in a "bad place". In an article for The Political Quarterly, the former civil service chief said: Lord O'Donnell did not spell out what criteria he thought candidates for Parliament should meet. But a Cabinet Office source dismissed the idea. The source said: "It is not clear who would oversee the pre-qualification of Parliamentary candidates, and for what purpose. At present they undergo rigorous scrutiny by the electorate. It's called democracy" Lord O'Donnell said MPs could get training to prepare them for jobs as ministers. He wrote: "There are very few jobs that do not require individuals to undertake training and development before being promoted, so this would bring MPs into line with the reality of their constituents' lives." A new body called the Office for Taxpayer Responsibility would be established to vet both government policies and opposition manifestos. He wrote: "The rising trend in obesity, the growth of dementia and Alzheimer's and mental health issues in general make it hard to see how the state can afford to help all who need it." Falling potential economic growth and an increasing demand on public services created a "vicious pincer movement", he said. Voters were put off politics by the way politicians behaved on occasions like Prime Minister's Questions, and some new MPs were already disillusioned with their jobs. They increasingly faced a choice between free, but second rate, public services and expensive private provision. "We are in a bad place," wrote the former cabinet secretary. "But it is a stable bad place." Despite rejecting Lord O'Donnell's ideas for parliamentary candidates, the Cabinet Office source accepted improvements were needed. He said: "The current leadership of the Civil Service have identified serious deficiencies in capabilities, in talent management and development, and in a culture that too often stifles innovation and has a bias to inertia. "That's why together we are implementing a programme of Civil Service reform to deal with these issues which had been ignored for far too long." </body>

      <description>DUP MP Jeffrey Donaldson urges that the law should be changed so that terrorists are not given the same status as victims.</description>

      <body>A DUP MP has urged that the law should be changed so that terrorists are not given the same status as victims. Lagan Valley MP Jeffrey Donaldson said it was "an affront to decency" that the law defines terrorists in the same way it defines their victims. Mr Donaldson told the House of Commons he hoped to change the law regarding the definition of victims with a private member's bill. The bill is due for a second reading in December. A similar bill was brought to the Northern Ireland Assembly in 2010 but did not become law. He told MPs: "You cannot equate the perpetrators of terrorist violence with their innocent victims." His comments came during a DUP-sponsored debate that was called to discuss the legacy of the Troubles. Mr Donaldson opened the debate by referring to the 20th anniversary of the Shankill bombing. He read out the names of those who died during the bombing on Belfast's Shankill Road on 23 October 1993. He said those who died "will never be forgotten". In referring to the events of 1993 his party colleague, Upper Bann MP David Simpson, told the house that "no-one made Thomas Begley and Sean Kelly plant that bomb". The DUP motion said that those who engaged or supported acts of terrorism "will not succeed" in rewriting the narrative of this troubled period in Northern Ireland's history. The motion also praised members of the armed forces, the police and the prison service. North Down MP Lady Hermon used the occasion to praise the work of the RUC during the Troubles. Tributes were also paid by the Secretary of State Theresa Villiers Ms Villiers and her Labour shadow Ivan Lewis also clashed over whether the government is doing enough in Northern Ireland. Ivan Lewis, the new shadow secretary of state, told the Commons that "many people in Northern Ireland think the government is not engaged". Ms Villiers rejected the assertion and said he had made this allegation before and suggested it simply was not true. She told MPs that the government was fully engaged with Northern Ireland, the political parties and the Haass talks process. She said the recent G8 summit and the investment conference in Belfast were examples of how much the government was involved in Northern Ireland. Mr Lewis's remarks came just days after he warned that the government was "being complacent on Northern Ireland". This DUP motion was timely and comes as the former US envoy Richard Haass is trying to find political consensus on the past, flags and parading. South Belfast MP Alasdair McDonnell said the failure "to grasp these issues has cost us dear". The SDLP leader said an agreement among the parties "would inspire hope and create ambition". Mr Lewis said the Haaas discussions "can not be allowed to fail". Ms Villiers said the government was fully engaged with the former US envoy and confirmed that she would be meeting him again next week. </body>

      <title>Firms still failing over 'swaps'</title>
      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people plan to attend a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed Â£180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <title>Heseltine plea on 'decaying' towns</title>
      <description>A magazine article which suggested that government money should no longer be spent on some deprived English towns and cities is criticised by former cabinet minister Lord Heseltine.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24630952</url>

      <body>The former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine has dismissed claims that "failing" towns and cities should be abandoned by the government. An article in The Economist suggested that a number of industrial towns were "decaying" and their inhabitants should be encouraged to find jobs elsewhere. The magazine listed Hull, Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool as places where "dollops of public money" had failed to boost the local economy, despite years of heroic effort. The article has caused an outcry in Hull, where the city council leader described its recommendations as "disgusting". In an interview for the Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Lord Heseltine said similar claims were made about Liverpool in the 1980s. Michael Heseltine was appointed by Margaret Thatcher to lead the regeneration of Liverpool, following riots in the city in 1981. The former Conservative cabinet minister claims the best way to stimulate economic growth in deprived towns and cities is to devolve more power away from Whitehall. Lord Heseltine said: "What I have argued over decades is that we should say to cities what would you do? "Because you know what Leeds needs, what Bradford needs and what Hull needs." Former Liverpool MP Peter Kilfoyle told me there had been numerous calls over the years to turn-off the government spending taps on Merseyside. Mr Kilfoyle, who served as a Labour minister under Tony Blair, said: "We had a think-tank a few years ago which said that Liverpool should be abandoned and everybody should move to the south. "This is nonsense. Any forward looking government would want to invest in Hull, just as they invested in Liverpool." Cabinet papers from 1981 reveal the chancellor of the exchequer at the time - Sir Geoffrey Howe - raised the possibility of a programme of "managed decline" in Liverpool. However, Lord Howe recently said there was never a suggestion that Liverpool should be abandoned by the Conservative government in the 1980s. </body>

      <title>Labour councils and Pickles in row</title>
      <description>As Labour-run local authorities warn over new cuts, Eric Pickles accuses them of "shroud waving".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24627811</url>

      <body>The battle lines are being drawn. Within the next few months, our large local authorities will outline where the spending axe will fall on local services. It's become an annual fixture in the political calendar. By the end of this parliament, councils will have seen their budgets squeezed by one third, with the prospect of further cuts after the next general election. But in the East Midlands, there are two new players. Both Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire are now Labour controlled; and since the party's victory in May's local elections, hardly a day has passed without a dire warning of the tough choices having to be taken by the new leadership to balance the books. The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles this week got his retaliation in first. He told MPs that complaining Labour authorities were more interested in "shroud-waving" and cutting front-line services. He's also been brushing down his "50 Ways to Save", his guide to councils to make the most of their budgets. It'll be no surprise that the leader of Derbyshire county council, Labour's Anne Western, takes a very different view of the financial challenges facing her authority in the next budget round. "You can either shrink and shrink your services until there's nothing left, or we can reinvent what we do," she told me. "In the six months since we took control, we've been talking to partners like the NHS. Our priority is what the people of Derbyshire want." That may be music to the ears of the Communities Secretary. He's been encouraging councils to reach out to other organisations to share costs. "To be frank, this is the future," he said. "It makes sense to work together on procurement, joint use of offices and shared services." One key area for Anne Western is the provision of council-run residential care services for the elderly. Derbyshire has 26 such care homes and spends Â£72m annually on care services, one of the highest of any shire county. Many of its neighbouring authorities have already sold-off or part-privatised the service. Anne Western said: "People get a huge sense of confidence when the service is council-run because of the quality of the staff and the training. It's also more accountable." Only a few weeks ago, the prime minister dismissed warnings from Anne Western over the consequences of budget cuts on services and jobs in Derbyshire. He described additional council cuts following the chancellor's budget as "relatively modest". "He's just playing with numbers," replied Anne Western. "It's not just me as a Labour leader. There are Conservative leaders up and down the country arguing the case for a rethink on budgets." Rethink? From the Communities Secretary? That may look unlikely. What's more likely is Eric Pickles quoting from a recent BBC/ ICM survey . It indicated that many people believe local council services - rubbish collection, libraries and schools - have actually improved in the past few years. In the months ahead, watch out for those battle lines being drawn. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24646527</url>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about Â£1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or Â£112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <description>Focus on growth ahead of EU summit</description>

      <body>The summer is past and European summits return. Europe's leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday with the markets becalmed and some economic statistics to celebrate. Even the threat - a few weeks back - of the Italian government falling scarcely ruffled the markets. The promise by the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, a year ago, to do whatever it takes to defend the euro continues to act as a shield against the bond market vigilantes. No one, it seems, is prepared to bet against the ECB. It is true that almost on a daily basis there are reassuring signs of progress. The Spanish economy has just edged out of recession after two years. Since 2008 its exports have grown by an impressive 14.6%. Unemployment at above 26% may have peaked. Italy is running a trade surplus and Greece this year will register a primary budget surplus excluding debt repayments. Ireland is set to exit its bailout programme in mid-December. And yet despite all the austerity and spending cuts the level of debt, amongst the countries that use the eurozone, is still rising. French unemployment, which was down in August, is set to rise again. Italy is struggling to bring down its labour costs without which it cannot be competitive. The Greeks are locked in argument with their lenders over a budget gap. It may need further funding. It was revealed this week that Greeks are, on average, 40% poorer than in 2008. Even the most Panglossian of Europe's leaders recognises that the recovery is fragile and solid growth is needed so in Brussels the leaders will concentrate on supporting and expanding the digital economy and building a single digital market. Discussions on telecoms, copyright, data protection, credit card payments and digital signatures can appear dry but are all central to what potentially will be the fastest growing economic sector in the future. UK Prime Minister David Cameron will try to focus the dinner conversation on reducing red tape and on revealing the cost of EU regulations to the business community. The difficulty for the European heads of government is that many of these ideas and initiatives take time when there are 26 million people out of work in the EU. Growth of at least 1.5% is needed to start reducing the unemployment lines. In the short term, the most important step is to make it easier for small- and medium-sized companies to borrow at affordable rates. Even while the focus is on growth, important decisions about the euro lie ahead but they cannot be taken whilst Germany is still in the process of forming its coalition government. Almost certainly those decisions will not be taken at this summit. The eurozone has agreed on a banking supervisor but it has not agreed on a resolution mechanism for winding up failing banks. The Germans do not want to pick up the bill. Yet cleaning up the banks remains the eurozone's biggest challenge. In Germany there is much discussion about Chancellor Angela Merkel's supposed plan for the eurozone. The idea is probably less developed than presented but countries would have to accept binding contracts which would give Brussels more power over national budgets and even social security and pensions. If that was to happen, the Germans say it would require treaty change and that is strongly opposed by the French. What all this underlines is that in the months and years ahead, Europe will still be building up its defences against the crisis re-occurring. On Friday the leaders will discuss migration from Africa and the Middle East and the need to prevent further tragedies at sea as occurred off the island of Lampedusa. Former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said: "The EU has proved unable to forge a harmonised immigration policy... It is not even able to rescue those who still believe in the European dream." Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has said that Europe "cannot sit there and watch" and has called for "immediate action". There is a general consensus that Europe needs to do more but almost all plans run up against difficulties. Perhaps the least controversial step is to put more resources into Frontex, the agency that patrols the Mediterranean. Others want to see the EU doing more to prevent migrants reaching the Libyan border. The EU already has a mission in the country but it has been frustrated at almost every level. Libya's borders are now so porous that persuading Tripoli to patrol its own shoreline is unrealistic. Some leaders will want an open discussion about "burden-sharing" and a change to asylum policy but this is politically sensitive. Very rapidly a discussion about migration can become one about "the free movement of people" within the EU. There will be expressions of solidarity but if there are to be major decisions about migration and asylum, they may not take place until June next year after the European elections.

      <title>Leadership - Fergie's recipe</title>
      <description>What Sir Alex said to Tony Blair about sacking Gordon Brown</description>

      <body>Loyalty, control, discipline. Those are the ingredients of leadership. So says the man who I once teasingly described as "the greatest living Briton". Sir Alex Ferguson was launching his new autobiography today. I went along to Fergie's news conference to ask the man known simply as "the boss" whether the qualities that make a great leader on and off the pitch can be transferred to other fields and, in particular, to politics. What leaders have to do, he told me, was to create loyalty in their staff, transmit their philosophy and exert control and discipline. Leadership, he says, is a quality which allows your personality to transfer to everyone. Interestingly his book, though largely about football, does include a revelation about his involvement in politics. He denies a claim made in Tony Blair's memoirs that he had advised the former prime minister to sack Gordon Brown. Ferguson's recollection is that while Blair asked him how to handle superstars and not Brown in particular. The advice was clear and is a theme of this book - "the minute they threaten your control, you have to get rid of them". Fergie describes himself as being "on the left" of the Labour party, "closer to Brown (than Blair) in principle" but accepting that "Blair's more populist way was the route to get elected". Today the questions all focussed on the big footballing names Sir Alex struggled to control or to compete with - Beckham, Keane, Mourinho and the rest. There are many more I would love to ask about how a leader inspires loyalty, maintains control and instils discipline. My colleague David Bond's interview with Sir Alex will run soon. </body>

      <body>Syria's brutal civil war is pushing a new wave of migrants towards Europe. Their numbers have surged, but many asylum seekers in Europe have also fled the conflicts and turmoil in Afghanistan, Iraq and the Horn of Africa. European governments are struggling to co-ordinate their response to the influx. Large movements of migrants from country to country quickly fuel suspicions that some politicians are trying to shift the burden onto their neighbours. Greece and Italy - major entry points for migrants - say there must be more burden-sharing in the EU, especially as they have been hit hard by the eurozone crisis. Migrants continue to board overcrowded, rickety boats, risking their lives. The recent deaths of hundreds of migrants in the Mediterranean highlighted their plight. Asylum is granted to those who say they are fleeing persecution and who can convince the authorities that they would face harm or even death if they were to be sent back. Nearly a quarter of asylum applications in the EU are handled by Germany. France is the second biggest destination for asylum seekers. But often English-speaking migrants head for the UK, which is home to large communities from Pakistan, Somalia and Middle Eastern countries. Among the asylum seekers from Russia there are many Chechens, whose homeland was devastated by war between separatist rebels and Russian troops. The asylum seekers from Serbia include many Roma and ethnic Albanians, who complain of discrimination in Serbia. In the developed world the US is the top destination for asylum seekers, but Germany and France are second and third. Sweden, with a much smaller population, is fourth, ahead of the UK. But it is important to remember that developing countries host more than 80% of the world's refugees. People fleeing conflict or persecution often end up in a neighbouring country - but many do not want to settle there permanently. Pakistan, with 1.6 million refugees, ranks highest for sheltering refugees. The vast majority of Afghan refugees are in Pakistan and Iran. Globally Europe is the main place where asylum claims are processed. For many asylum seekers Europe is easier to reach overland or by boat, especially those fleeing conflicts in the Middle East or Africa. And people traffickers already have well-established smuggling routes to Europe. The figures illustrate why immigration has become such a hot topic in Europe. Globally Afghanistan ranks first in terms of asylum seekers' country of origin. But the war in Syria has pushed that country into second place. China and Pakistan are also major countries of origin. Both countries have anti-government minorities and dissidents who allege discrimination or persecution. </body>

      <title>Britain's Syria dilemma - UK talks</title>
      <description>When is regime change not regime change?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24628885</url>

      <body>When is regime change not regime change? That in a sense is the dilemma of British and much of Western policy towards Syria. There is no doubt that Britain - like many other governments - would like to see the back of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But Britain's policy is not "regime change" if by that is meant the forcible removal of President Assad from power by outside military intervention. The approach taken to oust the Libyan leader Col Muammar Gaddafi is not seen as either practical or appropriate for Syria. The British Foreign Secretary William Hague has always insisted that the agency of change in Syria must be the Syrian people themselves. Britain is certainly backing key elements of the opposition forces - those represented here in London at a meeting with Arab and Western foreign ministers - under the umbrella body the Syrian National Coalition. But Britain's stated goal is a political transition in the country, agreed at the negotiating table, whereby President Assad effectively gives up power. Mr Hague reiterated the primacy of the political track in his comments ahead of the London meeting between the Syrian National Coalition and their key backers among Western and Arab governments. "We want the moderate opposition in Syria to know that we are behind them in going to Geneva," said Mr Hague, "and that we will continue to help them in many ways and to persuade them that this is the only way to solve this tragic and bloody conflict in Syria. There has to be a political process." Of course there have been moments when Britain has been ready to take a very different tack. The British government was willing to participate in military action to punish the Syrian regime for its alleged use of chemical weapons. But the British Parliament was not ready to sanction military force and neither was the US Congress - when push came to shove, military action was removed from the agenda. Of course, the real question is whether the British approach to Syria is likely to succeed in leading to a political transition, and more significantly, what kind of Syria would such a transition produce? The fact is that options are limited. There are only a few levers through which influence can be exerted, and in the final analysis the situation on the ground inside Syria is for now probably just too complex to be amenable to outside diplomatic solutions. Britain, like many other Western governments, threw its weight behind the moderate opposition in Syria in response to the repression of President Assad's government. Before that, President Assad had been something of a favourite of the West, courted especially by London and Paris. Policy in the early stages of the Syrian conflict was heavily influenced by the then limited experience of the "Arab Spring", which was still seen as a broadly positive movement under which tyrannical regimes were overthrown by popular pressure from below. Syria was seen as just the latest such regime to come under threat. Hindsight is wonderful thing. Quite what alternative policy options were open is unclear. But the initial rosy glow of Arab empowerment has given way to a more nuanced and in many cases conflicted analysis. The Arab Spring has overthrown governments offering a measure of stability and unleashed forces that in some cases are antithetical to the democratic values many believed the Arab Spring enshrined. The dilemmas have been seen most profoundly in Egypt where a successor and elected Islamist government was itself overthrown by what many would regard as a military coup. The problems in Syria have manifested themselves even before the collapse of the government. Jihadist groups hold sway in some areas of the country. More moderate Islamists with a largely Syrian agenda are increasingly prominent among the armed groups combating the government on the ground. Many of these groups too are not eager to sit down with President Assad's people in Geneva. Britain is seeking to deal with what it calls "the moderate" opposition. It's an opposition made very much in its own image. Would be democrats, exiles, technocrats, the sort of people Britain and other Western governments believe could create a new open and democratic Syria. But how representative are these groups of the factions on the ground? How well are they linked into the fragmented and volatile world of the opposition? And crucially could they hold power against other centrifugal forces if the political process ever does arrive at the transition that Western governments and many Syrians crave? </body>

      <title>Union 'positive' over Grangemouth</title>
      <description>Union leaders voice optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant.</description>

      <body>Union leaders have voiced optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant. The Unite union said it had decided to "embrace" a survival plan put forward by owner Ineos, "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs when Ineos announced the closure on Wednesday. Workers had rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Speaking after the talks, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Before the meeting, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union Unite would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Unite remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that Ineos would reverse its decision. The company had previously said that while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael are expected to hold talks at Grangemouth on Thursday afternoon. Mr Swinney had earlier said that he hoped the talks between the management and union leaders would be "constructive and successful" He said: "I hope that at this very, very, very late stage in the process there is a willingness to listen to and to consider the proposals being put forward. "Everybody is agreed that this plant has a strong future with the necessary investment and that is why the Scottish government is willing to be a player in that." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest Â£300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that Â£300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <title>Poor care risk 'at 1 in 4 hospitals'</title>
      <description>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows.</description>

      <body>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows. The findings are based on monitoring by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of a host of data, including death rates, serious errors and patient surveys. It found 44 out of 161 trusts fell into the two highest risk categories. The exercise has been carried out as part of the regulator's new hospital inspection regime, which will see inspectors go into every trust by 2015. The first inspections got under way in September and by Christmas the first 18 will have been completed. It will result in every trust being given a rating of either 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' as part of a shake-up in the system ordered after the Stafford Hospital scandal. The CQC said the latest information was not a final judgement, but would be used to prioritise which trusts to inspect earlier in the process. Hospital chief inspector Prof Sir Mike Richards likened the risk review to a form of "screening". He added: "Our intelligent monitoring helps to give us a good picture of risk within trusts, showing us where we need to focus our inspections." The regulator has assessed each trust's performance against up to 150 different indicators. Those performing worse than would be expected on each indicator get marked down as being at risk or elevated risk for that topic. The number of risk scores they have determines which of the bands they are placed in. Bands one and two - those at highest risk - include 24 trusts and 20 trusts respectively. The trusts in band one include the 11 trusts already placed in special measures after a review of high mortality rates. They are joined by Croydon Health Services, which was rated high risk in 12 areas for issues such as patient survey results and whistle-blowing. Also in band one are Barking, Havering and Redbridge, which was rated high risk in 13 areas including AandE waits and patient surveys, and Aintree, rated high risk in 11 areas including an elevated risk for mortality rates. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon, who is also a CQC board member, said: "It makes sense to use the wealth of routinely available data in the NHS to try to spot patterns which might identify or predict poor quality care for patients. "The intelligent monitoring tool can never by itself be a crystal ball, but it is a great start and will surely develop over time." Labour Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said: "David Cameron should be ashamed that he's put so many of England's hospitals in this position. "He siphoned Â£3bn out of the NHS front-line to blow on a back-office re-organisation nobody voted for. Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos." Use the table below to see how your local trust is rated. Select Trust Name to sort alphabetically or Band to sort by band. Each trust has been put into one of six bands. Bands one and two are the ones classed as high risk, while five and six are the lowest risk. Not all the indicators are applicable to every trust - so trusts have only been assessed against the one relevant to them and a proportionate risk score has been calculated. Where serious concerns have been expressed about a trust already, such as being placed in special measures, the organisation is automatically placed in band one regardless of the risk score. The trusts marked with an * are those that have been elevated for this reason. Source: Care Quality Commission </body>

      <title>Clegg and PM at odds on green levies</title>
      <description>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not agree with the prime minister's bid to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills.</description>

      <body>The prime minister's announcement that he wanted to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills was unexpected, Nick Clegg has said. "It's not something that I fully agree with," the deputy prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Lib Dem leader confirmed that the government was to look into whether its environmental policies could be delivered more cost-effectively. They may be funded in future from taxes rather than green levies, he suggested. But he insisted that the coalition's environmental objectives "remain clear and stable". And Downing Street later said work was under way to examine how green levies "can be rolled back from the bills" and paid for by alternative funding. During his Today interview Mr Clegg said in the weeks ahead he and Mr Cameron "will stress-test all these different levies". "If we can deliver those objectives of keeping the lights on, insulating people's homes helping the fuel-poor, supporting the green economy for less, of course I don't want to see an extra penny go on people's bills that is absolutely necessary." But funding for "looking after the environment, securing thousands of jobs in the renewable green sector, and... giving deductions on people's fuel bills for two million of the poorest households in our country" should not end, he argued. This was not the biggest factor driving up energy bills, Mr Clegg added: "In fact, 60% of the increase in energy bills since 2010 have come from wholesale prices." There was, he said, a "big argument" on energy policy, especially since Labour's announcement that it plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if it wins the next general election. "You've got an argument from Ed Miliband, and it is a con, by the way: his freeze would see prices go up, jobs go down, investment go down. "And then you appear to have a new kind of theory emerging from the right of British politics, which says it is all the fault of us caring about the environment. "I don't accept either of those propositions." Mr Clegg also stressed that he was confident he and the prime minister could "resolve" their differences on the policy. On Wednesday at his weekly Commons question session, Mr Cameron told MPs: "We need to help people pay their bills and we need to help to get bills down. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The Liberal Democrats subsequently accused the PM of making a "panicky U-turn". A senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. The Labour leader said that Mr Cameron "was changing his policy every day of the week". "His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him," he added. In a speech later, Mr Miliband is expected to argue that the PM has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy. Mr Miliband will accuse the PM of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs, according to pre-released extracts of the speech. </body>

      <body>The heads of GCHQ, the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service are to testify in public at a parliamentary committee for the first time. The Intelligence and Security Committee has said it will hear from GCHQ's Sir Iain Lobban, MI5's Andrew Parker and MI6's Sir John Sawers on 7 November. MPs and peers would seek to "give an insight into the world of intelligence, and the work the Agencies do on behalf of the UK", the committee added. The hearing will be broadcast, it said. The evidence session is expected to last for about an hour and a half. In a statement on its website, the committee said: "It represents a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies. "The committee will question the agency heads on the work of the agencies, their current priorities and the threats to the UK. "Among other things it will cover the terrorist threat, regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber security and espionage. "However, since this is a public session, it will not cover details of intelligence capabilities or techniques, ongoing operations or sub judice matters [i.e. those currently being considered in the courts]. "The committee questions the agencies about these details in their closed sessions." The committee would broadcast its proceedings with a delay so that it retained the power to pause transmission of proceedings "if anything is mentioned which might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies", it added. Only parliamentary pass holders and "a small number of print journalists" would be able to take up the "limited number of seats available in the meeting room itself", the committee said. Members of the committee include former cabinet secretary Lord Butler of Brockwell, Labour's former communities secretary Hazel Blears, and ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell. The committee is chaired by Conservative MP and former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>A staff member at a mental health centre has been charged with helping a convicted murderer escape from custody. Lerone Boye, 27, was jailed for life in December for stabbing a 17-year-old boy to death at a birthday party in 2011. He was being held at the John Howard Centre in Homerton, east London, when he absconded on 16 October. Dean Ablakwa, 29, from north London, will appear at Thames Magistrates' Court later charged with conspiracy to assist an offender to escape. Officers in Hackney are continuing to appeal for help in tracing Boye, who is described as black, about 5ft 10in and slim, with short black hair. He has a scar on his right cheek, a goatee beard and a gold tooth in his upper row of teeth. Police have released an image of Boye moments before he escaped. People are advised not to approach him but dial 999. Boye was ordered to serve a minimum of 28 years for stabbing Kelvin Chibueze at the Arteflex Club in Ilford, east London. He was chased out of a birthday party and attacked with glass and broken bottles. </body>

      <title>US health chief becomes new NHS boss</title>
      <description>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service.</description>

      <body>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service. Simon Stevens, who has worked as an NHS manager and acted as a health adviser to Labour, will take over from Sir David Nicholson in April. Mr Stevens is currently working for United Healthcare as its global health president. His appointment comes at a challenging time for the health service. While the NHS budget has been protected - it is rising 0.1% each year at the moment - the settlement still represents the biggest squeeze on its funding in its history. This is happening at a time when there are growing demands for care. There have already been signs the NHS is struggling to cope. Last winter pressure on AandE units meant the waiting time target was missed from January to March. Meanwhile, a growing number of trusts are running up deficits. As chief executive of NHS England, Mr Stevens will have control over the day-to-day running of the health service. Mr Stevens would be paid the same as Sir David - Â£211,000 per year - but had offered to take a 10% pay cut in the first year due to "NHS spending pressures", NHS England said. He will draw a salary of Â£189,900 in the first year. Christina McAnea, head of health at the union Unison, sounded a note of caution about Mr Stevens' appointment. She told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: "I am surprised that they haven't been able to find someone within the NHS... and somewhat concerned that this is the Tory-Lib Dem government trying to install American medical values." Ms McAnea said she hoped it was not a "surreptitious attempt" to move away from the NHS values of "free medicine for all" But the chairman of NHS England, Sir Malcolm Grant, said they wanted to do a global search and believe Mr Stevens is the right person to lead the health service through the coming years. Sir Malcolm told the Today programme: "We wanted the best in the world and we've got I think the best in the world. Of course we've got somebody who's got experience both of the public health system in this country and of the best of American healthcare. "The NHS has to be open to ideas from across the world. All nations are facing a crisis in the affordability of healthcare and the American experience is valuable to us." Mr Stevens said: "It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our health service." NHS England chairman Prof Sir Malcolm Grant said: "I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. "We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. "I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy." Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Simon has an extraordinary reputation in the UK and abroad as a reformer and an innovator, and we are lucky to have someone of his calibre doing such a vital role. "He will make a key contribution to the two biggest challenges facing the NHS right now - how to raise standards of care and also be financially sustainable. "His passion for our universal health service free at the point of use goes back many years but he will add international expertise as we face the challenges ahead." The announcement comes after Sir David said in May he was stepping down after seven years leading the health service. He had faced repeated calls to resign over his role in the Stafford Hospital scandal. Sir David spent 10 months in charge of the local health authority in 2005 and 2006 at the height of the problems. </body>

      <title>Police watchdog expansion 'on track'</title>
      <description>A newly-empowered police watchdog will begin investigating complaints against the police next year, Home Secretary Theresa May will say later.</description>

      <body>A newly-empowered police watchdog will begin investigating complaints against the police next year, Home Secretary Theresa May has said. The expansion of the Independent Police Complaints Commission is "on track", she told the College of Policing. It came after a report by MPs said the IPCC was "overwhelmed, woefully under-equipped and failing to get to the truth of allegations". Mrs May also announced the creation of the first-ever police code of ethics. The plans follow concern over force standards in wake of the phone-hacking scandal, the handling of the Hillsborough disaster, and the sacking of several senior officers. Mrs May said in a speech at the College of Policing that it was "astonishing" the police have never had a code of ethics. She said the college's new code of ethics would be like a "Hippocratic Oath of policing" - setting down standards which all officers will be expected to follow. The college said the code would apply to more than 220,000 police officers and staff across England and Wales. Chief Constable Alex Marshall, Chief Executive of the College of Policing, said: "The code of ethics is a first for policing in England and Wales. "It is a national document reflecting the core principles and standards of behaviour that every member of the police service should strive to maintain. "We do not want this to be 'just another document' for officers and staff to read. "It must be one that is used to help people make professional decisions - to do the right thing in the right way. "It encourages officers and staff to report improper conduct and never ignore unprofessional behaviour by a colleague." The IPCC's expansion will allow it to take on all serious and sensitive allegations made against officers. In February, Mrs May said it would create a stronger and more consistent system of vetting. Mrs May said that some forces, as well as police and crime commissioners, had attempted to resist the transfer of resources required for the IPCC to take on a bigger role. "I want to say to them very clearly that the events of last year prove overwhelmingly the case for a beefed-up IPCC and that is what I'm determined to deliver. "The expansion of the IPCC is on track and the IPCC will begin to take on additional cases from next year," she said. New powers were given to the IPCC before it investigated allegations that police officers were involved in a cover-up of failings following the 96 deaths at the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy. The home secretary said further powers could be given to the commission if required in the future. One in four officers faced complaints between 2011 and 2012. </body>

      <body>Staff at a school in Gloucestershire that became infested with venomous spiders have denied they overreacted by closing for a day. Pest controllers were called in to fumigate The Dean Academy in the Forest of Dean on Wednesday after false widow spiders were found earlier in the week. Some people have criticised the closure, saying the creature's bite is not serious. A spokesman said the school had taken advice from environmental health. The school's education adviser, Phil Lomax, said: "We haven't overreacted at all. "When there's infestation of any kind in a school building it's important to take careful consideration of risk to health and well-being. "In this particular case, with the advice from environmental health, a quick fumigation allowing the fumes to clear and [get] back to normal was the best solution. "You can't actually know whether some students may be more susceptible to bites, stings from wasps, spiders or any other [bugs] either, so I think we've taken a balanced view here in the best interests of students." Some parents told the BBC they thought it had been wrong for the whole school to be shut while the problem was dealt with. Entomologist Steven Falk said: "[The noble false widow] has got a toxic bite but the bite is on a par with a honey-bee sting. "They're nowhere near as dangerous as the media is making out, so we're a little bit surprised [that the school was closed]." There were no reports of anyone being bitten by the arachnids, and the school reopened as normal on Thursday after Wednesday's fumigation. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most venomous of the dozen or so species of biting spider known in Britain. Its bite can cause severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers. </body>

      <body>A pop concert for armed forces families will kick off this year's Poppy Appeal, which has a target of raising Â£37m. Acts including The Saturdays, Union J, Tich, and Luminites will take part in the event at RAF Northolt in west London on Thursday evening. Organisers at the Royal British Legion said military families were at the heart of the appeal for 2013. The Duchess of Cornwall will also visit The Poppy Factory in Richmond, Surrey, where the poppies are made. Ahead of her visit, The Poppy Factory announced that the duchess would become its patron. Wreaths, poppies and crosses for Remembrance Day events are handmade by disabled veterans at the Poppy Factory. The charity also helps disabled veterans find employment with other companies across the country. Chief executive Melanie Waters said: "The Poppy Factory uses its unique expertise to help disabled veterans into work with many businesses throughout the UK. "The patronage of The Duchess will help us to continue this work and to highlight the increasing need to support our disabled veterans into meaningful civilian employment." The Poppy Girls will sing this year's official Poppy Appeal single The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye). The group of five daughters of active service personnel was assembled after a national talent search. The Legion needs Â£1.6m a week to fund its work giving help, advice and support to the armed forces community. L/Cpl Cassidy Little, 32, of 42 Commando Royal Marines, is among those due to attend the concert. He benefitted from a theatre project supported by the Royal British Legion after he lost his lower right limb in an IED explosion in Afghanistan in May 2011. He said: "The theatre project funded by the Royal British Legion was a turning point in my recovery. "While the medical teams put my body back together, taking part in the play gave me back my self-esteem and confidence when it was at its lowest ebb." George Shelley, of X Factor boy band Union J, and who has a brother serving in the Royal Marines, said the poppy was a "symbol of pride". Royal British Legion fundraising director Charles Byrne said: "We support the entire armed forces community past and present, but families are at the heart of the Poppy Appeal in 2013. "We recognise the strength of mothers, fathers, partners and kids in armed forces families, who serve alongside their loved ones every single day and often need practical care and advice too. "We're encouraging people to dig deep for the Poppy Appeal so we can continue providing this vital support to individuals whether they're still serving, transitioning back to civilian life or have left the services, but importantly to their dependents too." The Poppy Appeal in Scotland was launched by Craig and Charlie Reid from The Proclaimers in Edinburgh on Wednesday. </body>

      <body>Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie is to be made a freeman of his Hampshire home town at a ceremony later. The 36-year-old will be made an Honorary Freeman of Lymington and Pennington at the event at the town's community centre. He will be the first person to have been given the honour by the town council, which was formed in 1980. Sir Ben is also an honorary life member of the Royal Lymington Yacht Club. The ceremony, at 18:30 BST, will be attended by the Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire, Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre, members of Sir Ben's family and fellow Olympians. Members of the public are also welcome to attend. Sir Ben, who was born in Macclesfield and grew up in Cornwall, has lived in Lymington for 13 years. He won four gold medals at the London 2012 sailing events, hosted in Weymouth and Portland in Dorset. He was knighted in the 2013 New Year Honours for his services to sailing. Lymington and Pennington town clerk Steve Cridland said: "We have been trying to get this done since January and tomorrow is the only time [Sir Ben] can make it. "It was his Olympic medals that sparked the whole thing but, of course, the America's Cup has happened since the council's decision." Sir Ben won medals at all five Olympic games from 1996 to 2012. Following his 2012 Olympic success, he was honoured with an open-top bus parade through Lymington. A postbox on the town's High Street was unofficially painted gold in his honour by resident Rob Smith. The act was initially described as "vandalism" by Royal Mail but it was later decided it could remain gold like the other 111 official postboxes painted gold to honour Team GB's Olympic heroes. The title of honorary freeman is generally given to people of distinction and people who have given their services to the local area. </body>

      <title>RUC and UDR men 'in murder gang'</title>
      <description>A new book claims members of the RUC and UDR were part of a loyalist gang that killed more than 100 people in the 1970s.</description>

      <body>A new book claims members of the RUC and UDR were part of a loyalist gang that killed more than 100 people in the 1970s. The book claims to have uncovered evidence of collusion on a huge scale. It says the loyalist gang operated from farms in counties Armagh and Tyrone. One extract, from an unpublished HET report, says there was "indisputable evidence of security forces collusion" that should have rung alarm bells all the way to the top of government. Lethal Allies - British Collusion in Ireland contains other extracts of unpublished reports by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) that refer to evidence of widespread collusion. The book is written by a researcher with the Pat Finucane Centre, a human rights advocacy and lobbying group in Northern Ireland. It is published on Thursday. The author, Anne Cadwallader, claims RUC officers and members of the UDR were part of a gang operating from two farms in south Armagh and Tyrone that killed 120 people between 1972 and 1976. "It can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that there was systemic collusion in these cases," she said. Allegations of collusion between members of the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries are nothing new. The BBC Spotlight programme investigated allegations about the existence of the gang nine years ago. At the time, two former RUC officers admitted they had been members of the gang. One of them was William McCaughey, who has since died. He was convicted of the murder of a Catholic shopkeeper and the kidnapping of a Catholic priest. He told BBC Spotlight he had been a member of the UVF while serving as a police officer and explained how it operated. "There was horses for courses obviously," he said. "There was people who were drivers, there was people who were able to take people's lives, shoot people. There was people who simply operated on an intelligence level, not every person involved was actually involved in the taking of life directly. "I was quite happy to co-operate at any level with any person who had a basic loyalty to Northern Ireland, who shared the same belief system, the same ideological system as myself." The book claims the loyalist gang operated from farms in Glennane in south Armagh, and Dungannon, County Tyrone, and that the security forces were aware of their activities. An extract, referring to the killings of four people in attacks on two pubs in Charlemont, County Armagh, on a night in May 1976, says: "It is difficult to believe... when judged in concert with other cases emerging at the time, that such widespread evidence of collusion in these areas was not a significant concern at the highest levels of the security forces and of government." Another HET report also claims that the RUC had advance knowledge of an attack in which two people died in August 1976. The book claims that days before the attack on the Three Steps Inn in Keady, County Armagh, the RUC knew a bomb was being stored at a farmhouse owned by a serving police officer and asked the army to put it under surveillance. According to the book, the surveillance operation was ended and the bomb was then used in the attack. It also claims that RUC Special Branch knew the identities of four people involved in the bombing, but that no arrests were made. The families of the two victims, 38-year-old Elizabeth McDonald and Gerard McGleenan, 22, have lodged complaints with the Police Ombudsman. </body>

      <body>Police have said a pipe bomb found during a security alert in County Antrim was designed to kill police officers. Police received a call around 22:00 BST on Wednesday to say a device had been thrown at a patrol in Mill Road, Newtownabbey. A number of homes were evacuated after midnight. Two suspicious objects were found during a search. One of the objects was a hoax while the second was a viable device. Residents were allowed to return to their homes just before 05:00 BST on Thursday. Ch Insp Stephen Reid, area commander of Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus said: "This device was clearly designed to kill police officers and we are very fortunate no-one was killed or injured. Had it exploded it could have killed or maimed anyone close by, police officers or local people alike. "Those responsible showed total disregard for the local community and put the lives of local people in the area at risk.

      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people plan to attend a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed Â£180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

"It is important that any player considering his future right now fully understands the level of support the WRU is prepared to offer," said WRU chief executive Roger Lewis. The governing body said regions had expressed concerns about their ability to conclude their own negotiations with leading players amid uncertainty over the future of the principal European club competition, the Heineken Cup. The WRU adds that once the negotiations regarding the European tournament are concluded the agreed player contracts would revert to the regions. Its offer came as a European Rugby Cup Limited (ERC) meeting for stakeholders was taking place in Dublin on Wednesday, a meeting representatives of the English and French clubs said they would boycott. BBC Wales Sport understands that Stuart Gallacher, the chief executive of Regional Rugby Wales, the umbrella organisation for the Welsh regions, did not attend the meeting either. Cardiff Blues, Ospreys, Scarlets and Newport Gwent Dragons have publicly backed Anglo-French plans for a new European competition. They claim the revamped tournament offers "significant advantages", but the WRU opposes the new European competition. Players' agent Tim Lopez, who represents Wales and Lions full-back Leigh Halfpenny, has already warned that some players are waiting to see what happens before deciding their futures. Halfpenny and Cardiff Blues and international team-mate Warburton are out of contract at the end of the season. Scarlets captain Jonathan Davies plus Ospreys trio Alun Wyn Jones, Adam Jones and Ian Evans are also out of contract in the summer. Lock Evans has stated he would consider leaving the region if they were not competing in the Heineken Cup. A number of leading players have left Wales in recent seasons to join richer French and English clubs and the WRU wants to ensure more do not follow. "I want to make it clear to our players that we have full confidence in the future of the elite game in Wales," WRU chief Lewis added. "It would be inappropriate to go into details about any negotiations or discussions which rightly have to be concluded in private. "But I respect the concerns of the players at a time when our talks on Europe are continuing. "Our squad is about to embark on a demanding autumn series of international games and it is vitally important all of their minds are completely focused on the task in hand. "I shared this proposal with the regional chairmen on Monday of this week and look forward to what I expect would be a positive response." </body>

      <body>A 24-year-old man from Arnol on Lewis has been accused of operating a slaughterhouse in a barn on his family's croft as a business. Norman Campbell is charged with breaking food hygiene regulations. Stornoway Sheriff Court heard that the Scottish SPCA, acting on a tip-off, found 32 carcasses and 77 sheep heads at the property in November 2011. Mr Campbell denies running a slaughtering business and maintains the meat was for his family's consumption. He has pleaded not guilty to seven charges. Four of the charges are under the food hygiene act and three under the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies regulations. Colm Fraser, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's head of environmental health, told the court he was convinced that such a volume of meat could not be for personal consumption. He added that the premises was a long way from being compliant with food safety regulations. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>A new Scottish company is to create at least 600 jobs over three years from its base in North Lanarkshire. Ascensos is creating the contact centre jobs in Motherwell on the site of the former Lloyds Banking Group premises which closed earlier this year. The company has said there could be more than 1,000 jobs over the next five years. Finance Secretary John Swinney said it was a "great boost" for employment in the area. Mr Swinney added: "I also recognise the company's commitment to employing those returning to work after a period of leave and those made redundant. "By occupying the former Lloyds Banking Group premises, Ascensos will bring a currently empty site back to life." Ascensos, created by former beCogent executives, has benefited from a grant of Â£1.8m from Scottish Enterprise. Managing director John Devlin said: "We want to create high-quality, long-term jobs in what is an area with tremendous skills availability. "Our experience in building a client-focused business with highly-engaged employees will prove invaluable. "In terms of roles created, our focus is not just on youth employment as we will also be looking to retrain and develop our people skills across the spectrum, including return-to-work mums and those affected by redundancy over recent years. "We want the very best people to play a big part in our success." The Motherwell centre is to be initially launched with 100 jobs and job numbers will increase as more new projects and clients come on board. Mr Devlin added: "We are in discussion with a number of top-name clients in the retail and e-commerce sectors. "As we develop ,we will become one of the largest employers in the area and our plan is to eventually diversify geographically and create more jobs in other areas of the UK." Councillor David Fagan, convener of regeneration for North Lanarkshire Council, said: "It's great news that Ascensos is going to be based in Motherwell. "I've been really impressed with their plans and that they have chosen Motherwell is a real endorsement of the town and North Lanarkshire as a great place to do business. "We will help in any way we can to help deliver Ascensos' aim of building a cutting-edge business. Creating jobs in North Lanarkshire is our number one priority and we really look forward to working with the team." </body>

      <body>Thousands of people in Greater Manchester have been queuing to get a chance of a signed copy of Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography. The former Manchester United manager's book signing has started at a Tesco supermarket not far from the club's Old Trafford stadium. Some fans queued since Wednesday's European Champions League tie against Real Sociedad. Ferguson, 71, stepped down as Reds boss after more than 26 years in May. Fans have travelled from the Far East, the Middle East and all over the UK to the book signing. Wearing a dark blue suit, Sir Alex arrived uttering a simple "hello" before settling into his seat to greet his fans. He managed United to 13 Premier League titles, two Champions League successes, five FA Cup wins and four League Cup triumphs. On Wednesday, he rewarded one woman, who had began queuing on Tuesday, by calling to see her at 18:30 BST with a signed copy of his book so she could go back home to Wales. </body>

      <body>Manchester United moved a step closer to the Champions League knockout stages with a narrow victory over Real Sociedad. Inigo Martinez's second-minute own goal - which also owed much to superb work by Wayne Rooney - ensured United maintained their unbeaten record in the competition this season. United manager David Moyes will have made three points his sole objective after the disappointing 1-1 Premier League draw at home to Southampton on Saturday and in a week when their European campaign has been reduced to a sideshow by revelations in former manager Sir Alex Ferguson's new autobiography. And on the night when United gave a trial to Old Trafford's new 'singing section',Â  they at least had something to celebrate - unlike the 6,000 colourful visiting fans who followed Sociedad. The La Liga side made United work hard for the win but it was one they fully deserved despite some anxious moments, particularly when Antoine Griezmann hit the post with a first-half free-kick. Rooney was once again United's main source of danger as he continued the outstanding form he has shown this season. If there are any complaints from Moyes, they will have centre on his side's inability to finish the game off earlier - as well as some questionable defending that offered Sociedad hope. And at least Moyes was finally able to move the agenda away from his predecessor Ferguson, who has claimed the headlines this week and overshadowed this important Champions League game as he raked over his 26 years in charge at Old Trafford. Once again, this was not a fluent United performance but the result will give them added confidence ahead the return meeting away to Sociedad in a fortnight. Moyes decided against risking striker Robin van Persie, who has been suffering with toe and groin injuries - but Rooney's irresistible form meant the Netherlands international was not missed early on as United were ahead inside two minutes. Rooney demonstrated perfect technique and speed of thought to evade three defenders in the area, only to curl a shot against the post with keeper Claudio Bravo beaten. As Sociedad appeared to have survived, Martinez sliced the rebound hopelessly into his own net. Sociedad had a valid claim for Javier Hernandez being offside as Martinez did his unwitting work but Dutch referee Bas Nijhuis and his officials were unmoved by the complaints. Rooney was at the heart of everything early on and almost added a second after 12 minutes - but Bravo was equal to his volley from Rafael's cross. From hesitant early beginnings, Sociedad grew in confidence into the game and were desperately unlucky not to equalise before half-time. David De Gea had already saved athletically from Haris Seferovic but he could do nothing to stop Griezmann's free-kick and was relieved as it bounced away off the woodwork. Sociedad continued to improve after the break but United were creating chances as Phil Jones saw his header blocked by Bravo and Antonio Valencia's low, angled shot struck the post. Fortunately for United, Sociedad had lost the impetus they gather in the early moments of the second half and did not make United pay for those missed chances. Manchester United boss David Moyes: "Yes [I was frustrated] because we had it on Saturday in a Premier League game when we lost a late goal. If we had scored five or six today it wouldn't would have looked out of place. "I'm concerned we gave away couple of free kicks on the edge of the box. But Wayne Rooney was absolutely terrific tonight, I was shouting at him in the last five minutes though. "We just want a top player like Wayne to play well. I said from day one that his training was great. I think England have seen that. But we need to see it all the time." </body>

      <body>Sergio Aguero scored twice as Manchester City came from behind to beat CSKA Moscow and reignite their Champions League Group D campaign. Manuel Pellegrini had complained about the pitch at the Khimki Arena, and the City boss must have feared the worst when Zoran Tosic put the hosts ahead. The former Manchester United player lobbed Joe Hart before Aguero levelled after David Silva's cross. Aguero capped a gutsy City display by heading home Alvaro Negredo's cross. It was far from comfortable for Pellegrini and his players, who were forced to endure some anxious moments against the Russian champions to record their second away win of the group stage. Indeed City goalkeeper Hart had to produce a fine stop with an outstretched leg to deny Japan international Keisuke Honda an equaliser deep into stoppage time. But victory over CSKA in the return game at the Etihad Stadium on 5 November ought to allow City to start planning for the knockout stages for the first time. After their flat performance against Bayern Munich three weeks ago, City now have six points from three games, three more than the Russians. CSKA painted the pitch green in some areas after Pellegrini said it was "unbelievable" Uefa passed it fit for use following heavy rain. But the Chilean's pre-match criticism of the surface was quickly brushed aside as City peppered the hosts' goal. Aguero, Yaya Toure, who said after the game he had been subjected to racist chanting, and Negredo all had chances before poor defending in the 32nd minute allowed Tosic to produce a moment of quality that was all too rare during his stint at Old Trafford between January 2009 and June 2010.Â  The 26-year-old Serbia international found the net with a delicate lob after Honda won an aerial duel with Javi Garcia. Yet the character lacking from Pellegrini's side in the 3-1 home defeat by Bayern last month was in ample supply as Aguero spearheaded the turnaround. Within two minutes the visitors were level, the Argentina forward getting ahead of marker Sergei Ignashevich to turn Silva's low cross home from close range. And three minutes before the interval, Aguero put City in front with his ninth goal of the season, a brave header following a delightful cross from the outside of Negredo's boot. CSKA pushed forward in search of an equaliser after half-time, Tosic proving a serious threat as City lived dangerously. Substitute Ahmed Musa thought he had equalised in the 80th minute with a terrific 20-yard strike but his effort was ruled out as Pontus Wernbloom fouled Toure. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini: "I'm very happy. The result is very important for the team. The whole team concentrated with intensity on a difficult pitch. "Aguero and Silva are both top players and every match they show how they can play football. We are not in the next round but this is very important for us." </body>

      <description>Yaya Toure calls on Uefa to act on racist chanting after claiming he was targeted during Manchester City's 2-1 win at CSKA Moscow.</description>

      <body>Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure is "furious" and wants Uefa to act on racist chanting after claiming he was targeted by home fans during his side's 2-1 victory at CSKA Moscow. The Ivory Coast international said he told referee Ovidiu Hategan about the chants as City came from behind to win the Champions League Group D tie. City, for whom Sergio Aguero scored twice, will make a complaint to Uefa. Toure said: "I'm not just disappointed, I'm furious." The 30-year-old captained City in the absence of injured defender Vincent Kompany. He added: "I'm very, very disappointed about what those fans have done. I think Uefa has to take action because players with the same colour of skin will always be in the same position. "For me, as captain, I was wearing an armband which said 'no to racism' and I was totally disappointed. "I told the referee. It was unbelievable and very sad." Asked what action he would like the European governing body to take, Toure said: "Maybe they could ban the stadium, I don't know, for a couple of years or a couple of months. "We have to be as strong as possible otherwise they will continue like that. Too much is too much. We have to stop it now." In May, Uefa announced that for racist incidents involving spectators, a partial stadium closure for the first offence and a full stadium closure for a second, coupled with a fine of 50,000 euros (Â£42,800), would be applied. Toure added: "It's not only in Eastern Europe and I have some friends who have had problems, too. "It's stupid. It just happens in football. As an African player, it is always sad when you hear something like that." City boss Manuel Pellegrini also called for action and said: "I think it's a pity that anyone would do such stupid things. I hope that they have heard the right measures to stop all those things, so it's a pity for Yaya, it's a pity for the city." Kompany did not play because of a thigh injury, but in a tweetÂ  after the game wrote: "Racist chants again in Moscow today. We've all said enough. Uefa, the Russian government and CSKA, all eyes are on you now. #StopRacism." Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce said he was "absolutely appalled". "I have always been very outspoken about any form of racism in sport," he told Radio 5 live. "Fifa and Uefa are absolutely united in making sure these events will become a thing of the past. I have always said fining clubs is not a solution to this problem because they can't stop some of these idiots. "The new rules say sanctions will be imposed. "It's got to be eradicated and the only way to do that is to take serious action against the people who do it. "Don't allow them to watch football matches and then perhaps they'll stop when they realise they won't get into a ground." With Russia staging the 2018 World Cup, Boyce added that the authorities needed to tackle racism in the country as a matter of urgency. "The Russian federation has got to assure - along with the Russian government - that these incidents are put to bed because it's happening too often," he said. Piara Powar, who heads the organisation Football Against Racism in Europe, said: "It's taken a long time but we are seeing some movement on the sanctions side. "In terms of education, I don't know how long it's going to take, to educate fans like we've seen at CSKA. We need governments to intervene." Speaking to 5 live he added: "The key thing here is Yaya Toure did what he should do: approach the referee and tell him about it. "That means that technically the Uefa process is triggered. The referee will have to mention it to the Uefa delegate at the match, he will put it in his report and Uefa will then have to charge CSKA." </body>

      <title>Coffee v smoothies: Which is better for you?</title>
      <description>At first glance it seems clear that a smoothie is a healthier option. The answer may not be so clear-cut, says Michael Mosley.</description>

      <body>One is made of fruit. The other is caffeinated. So a smoothie is a healthier option than a coffee, right? Don't be so sure, says Michael Mosley, as he weighs the evidence. Which is healthier - coffee or smoothies? It seems obvious that the answer must be a smoothie. After all, drinking coffee is a necessary evil while having a smoothie, made from fruit, is part of your five-a-day. But when you look into the scientific studies they reveal something much more surprising. Let's start with coffee. There have been numerous claims down the years that drinking coffee will increase your risk of a whole range of terrible things from heart disease to cancer. These claims have been largely based on case control studies, where you take a group of people who drink coffee and compare them with another matched group who don't. The problem with this approach is that coffee drinkers are more likely than non-coffee drinkers to have other "bad" habits, like drinking alcohol or smoking, so it is hard to tease apart what is really doing the harm. A more reliable way to get at the truth is to do what is called a prospective cohort study. You take a group of disease-free individuals, collect data about them, then follow them for a large number of years to see what happens. When scientists collected data on the coffee drinking habits of 130,000 men and women and then followed them for over 20 years they found that coffee is rather a good thing (The Relationship of Coffee Consumption with Mortality, Annals of Internal Medicine, June 2008). They crunched the numbers and concluded that "regular coffee consumption was not associated with an increased mortality rate in either men or women". In fact, data from this study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is mildly protective, leading to slightly lower all-cause mortality in coffee drinkers than non-coffee drinkers. Based on this and other studies the most effective "dose" is two to five cups a day. More than that and any benefits drop off. There are hundreds of different substances in coffee, including many different flavonoids (compounds widely found in plants that have antioxidant effects). Which of these ingredients is beneficial, we simply don't know. When it comes to the brain, however, the answer seems to be "caffeine". In research recently published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry (July 2013) they found that people who drank two to four cups of caffeinated coffee a day were half as likely to commit suicide as those who either drank decaff or fewer than two cups a day. This research pulled together data from three studies that had followed more than 200,000 people for more than 14 years, so it's pretty reliable. It is also supported by a number of other studies, which makes this claim even more plausible. One reason why caffeine may be a mild anti-depressant is that as well as making you more alert, it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin, that are known to improve mood. The researchers don't recommend going overboard, noting that "there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups". One note of caution is that these trials began many years ago so the sort of coffee consumption being tested is almost certainly good, old-fashioned coffee. A simple mug of coffee delivers somewhere between zero and 60 calories, depending on whether it is black, white or white with one sugar. Cappuccinos, lattes and mochas contain coffee but they also contain a lot of calories - anything between 100 and 600 - so when it comes to fancy coffees I limit myself to the occasional tall, skinny cappuccino (70 calories). But what about fruit smoothies? They may consist of pure fruit but by the time you've got rid of the peel and mashed the fibre then you have already lost many of the potential health benefits. What you are mainly left with is a sugary drink. In a survey published in early 2013, researchers found that out of 52 commercial smoothies, 41 had more sugar than Coca-Cola (a 12oz can contains the equivalent of about nine teaspoons), and all had more calories. Fruit smoothies are acidic and the bits cling to your teeth, so dentists are not enthusiastic. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but not when it's been peeled, blended, mashed and packaged. In a study published in August 2013 in the British Medical Journal (Fruit Consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes) they found that while eating fruit cuts your risk of developing diabetes, drinking it appears to increase the risk. This was another big study involving lots of people followed for many years. An interesting finding was that different fruits gave different levels of benefit. Three servings of blueberries, for example, cut the risk of diabetes by 26%, while eating apples, pears, bananas and grapefruits also had a positive, albeit much smaller, effect. Overall those who ate fruit cut their risk of developing diabetes by 2%, while those who drank it (more than three glasses of fruit juice a week) increased their risk by 8%. More bad news for fruit juice drinkers comes from a case-controlled study done in Western Australia that examined the daily diets of more than 2,000 people. They found that eating some types of fruit and vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and apples) cuts your risk of colorectal cancer, while drinking fruit juice was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Sugary drinks lead to raised levels of the hormone insulin and persistently high levels of insulin are associated with increased risk of some cancers. The researchers point out that many things that protect against bowel cancer, such as antioxidants and fibre, are lost or diminished during the juicing process. None of these studies specifically looked at the health benefits or otherwise of fruit smoothies, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, nor did they look at the impact of different types of juice - for instance, whether it was freshly squeezed or from concentrate, home-made or shop-bought. I would assume, for example, that drinking a home-made vegetable smoothie is going to be a lot better for you than a commercial fruit smoothie. And I very much doubt that the occasional fruit juice or fruit smoothie is going to do any harm. Nonetheless, I've personally given up buying them and we rarely have them in the house. I eat whole fruit and when it comes to soft drinks I'm sticking to water, tea and, of course, coffee.

      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <body>Prince George's christening on Wednesday comes 31 years after his father Prince William in 1982. Here are 10 ways in which baptisms have changed since then. George's christening is the exception rather than the rule. And not just because he's a royal. Although christenings were already in decline, one in three infants was still baptised into the Church of England in 1980. By 2011 that had fallen to just over one in 10. The overall number of baptisms - of people of all ages - witnessed a similar decline, from 266,000 in 1980 to 140,000 in 2011. It's a similar story in the Catholic Church, although the major drop-off in baptisms happened between 1964 and 1977, when the number halved. There's been a far gentler downward trend over the past three decades, recently stabilising at about 60,000 baptisms a year. Christenings may have dwindled but the number of godparents per child has increased. Prince George will have seven. Elizabeth Hurley's son apparently has six godfathers. And it's not just a celebrity fad. "In practice it seems to be changing," says the Archdeacon of Leicester, Tim Stratford, although there's been no doctrinal change. That's because both the Church of England and the Catholic Church only have minimum requirements, of three and one respectively. "It used to be the minimum that was the issue," says Stratford. "Now the issue for a lot of clergy is that often people are choosing a lot of godparents. "The registers we have, for instance, often only have four spaces to put godparents' names but people may be choosing six or eight." A godparent is supposed to mentor the child in their faith. And the rules haven't changed. "Because of what godparent strictly means, we only have practising Catholics as godparents, and fellow Christians as 'special witnesses'," says Fr Paul Keane, a parish priest in Essex. The Church of England does not distinguish between denominations, says Stratford. "The only requirement for godparents is that they should have been baptised. A Muslim or a Hindu cannot strictly speaking be a godparent, nor can a secularist who has not been baptised." While the Church does insist on godparents being baptised, that may not be uniformly enforced across all parishes. Stratford acknowledges that in practice the godparent's role is broader than just a religious one. "Providing the child has enough godparents, there's nothing to stop people being 'honorary godparents', without technically being one. That is fairly common in the Church," he says, explaining that the Church is soon to advise using the term "supporting friend". "It's the Church trying to catch up with emerging trends in society." People may be less religious but many are reluctant to relinquish all church traditions. "Naming ceremonies are on the rise and are something that we would probably expect to see increase in the coming years," says Sarah Barrett, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre. These were almost non-existent about 15 years ago but now there are hundreds every year, according to the British Humanist Association. "The lack of religious belief is why they're becoming more popular," says Barrett, with many enjoying "the idea of officially welcoming the baby into the world and introducing them to friends and family". And while they may have rejected religion, they haven't rejected religious terminology. "'Godparent' is a much easier term to explain to people than 'supportive mentor'," says Barrett. Plus, Marlon Brando has never portrayed a "supportive mentor". In 1992, almost 80% of Church of England baptisms were of babies under a year old. By 2011 this had dropped to about 60%. One in three Church of England christenings is now of a child between the ages of one and 12. "Traditionally christenings took place when the child was a baby but now more and more parents are waiting until they've had a second child and then getting both christened together," says Barrett. Sort of like a two-for-one deal. But it's only partially about cost, she says. "Parents like to do it when the child will perhaps remember the ceremony." High competition for school places is credited with creating a new phenomenon - the "bogus" baptism - where the primary motivation is to get a child into a faith school. "To be sure that I could have the privilege of having my son going to my local state school I had to pretend to be an Anglican," says atheist Andrew Penman, author of School Daze: My Search for a Decent State Secondary School. "It wasn't something I did for kicks or to undermine anyone else's faith. I did it under duress because that's really the only way I could be sure of getting into my local state school," he says, adding that he felt "embarrassed" and "awkward" during the ceremony. Penman feels the practice is widespread, indicating that the numbers of people attending church "fall off a cliff after the children get past the threshold at which they either get or don't get a [school] place". The word "bogus" is a bit strong in her case, says Jane, who prefers not give her real name. A lapsed Catholic with a non-religious Jewish husband, she says she'd always wanted her children to have a religious grounding. "But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the idea of schooling in my head. The most 'bogus' aspect is the time pressure," she says, admitting that she baptised her second child much earlier than her first after reading a parish newspaper warning that Catholic schools would be making the entrance criteria more stringent. "[It said] it would be a good idea to get your child christened in the first four months of their life," she says. It's difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is. Keane thinks that, if it's an issue at all, it's most likely to be in areas where Christian schools are oversubscribed, such as London. Both he and Stratford think that the preparation time and public nature of services mitigate the likelihood of large numbers doing so. "My experience has been that parents invariably wanted to mean what they were saying," says Stratford. George will be baptised in a replica of the same traditional white christening gown as his father and every monarch since Edward VII. But it's an increasing rarity. "Christening gowns are a bit out of fashion right now," says Barrett. "At [the baptismal] classes we were told that you no longer have to dress your child in a traditional gown," says Becky Bevis, who has a 13-month-old son. "He wore a white shirt and some baby chino trousers." None of the other four children baptised that day wore a gown either, she says. "What the Church simply asks is that the child is wrapped up in a white garment as a sign of their new life with Christ after they're baptised," says Keane. "Unless you've got an heirloom or a family tradition of passing down the christening gown, such as the royals, lots of mums will get their children dressed in cute outfits, pretty outfits, or christening nappies," says Barrett. Christenings are big business. Designers such as Vera Wang have got in on the action, while John Lewis witnessed an 8% growth in christening gift sales in the past year. Although the tradition for silver gifts still prevails, it seems to be less strictly adhered to. "We didn't receive any silver," says Bevis of her son's baptism, while she received a silver spoon for her own christening three decades ago. The penchant for silver rattles is waning, says Barrett. "Now planting trees is quite popular as a christening gift, as are things that you can give to the baby that are for future years," she says. "Some people give whisky that is meant to be drunk when the child reaches 21." Even those sticking to traditional silver may be cutting corners. Of John Lewis's premium christening gifts, only 55% were actually silver plate, with 40% pewter and 5% stainless steel. Babies may still cry from time to time, but it's far less likely to be the shrill shriek after being doused in freezing water. "Water's being warmed up in the fonts these days simply because churches can do it," says Stratford. "You wouldn't have to go very long ago to find most country churches having no electricity. How then would you provide warm water? It's got to be a relatively new phenomenon." Some rural churches may not yet have the capacity. "More and more churches are putting kitchens in so it's possible to boil a kettle and warm the water up," he says. The Church of England is still developing its language for the service. Until 1980 christening services were still given in 17th Century language. But while the Alternative Service Book introduced modern language, it provided "quite a thin service, with short questions and fewer [of them]", says Stratford. The Common Worship, introduced in 2000, hasn't pleased everybody. "The clergy thought that the language was too complex, [as were] the services themselves." It prompted the general synod in 2011 to agree new language was required, although the specifics have not yet been agreed. "It's not a dumbing-down of the language or the use of colloquialisms," says Stratford, nor about brevity or a loss of poetry, but about making the language less high-brow. Questions over the use of the word "submit" - as in "Do you submit to Christ as Lord?" - were also raised. "It felt quite inquisitorial," he says. "It was not easy for a lot of people to respond to that question because it was felt that 'submit' meant giving up and communicated the wrong meaning."

      <title>Clegg promises 'champion' heads</title>

      <body>Nick Clegg has promised to set up a "champions league" of head teachers to be brought in to sort out failing schools in England. In a speech, the deputy prime minister said experienced staff could join a "pool of top talent" which would be "ready to move" at short notice. He also said free schools and academies must only employ professionally qualified teachers. Labour said voters could not trust what Mr Clegg said on this subject. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that unqualified teachers currently working in schools would not be sacked under his proposals, but would instead be given the opportunity to "seek qualifications while you are teaching". He said the rules would not apply to private schools, which also employ teachers without professional qualifications, because "you pay your fees and you take your choice", but children using taxpayer-funded schools had a right to expect basic standards. Before the coalition relaxed the rules, state-funded schools could only employ teachers on a permanent basis if they had completed teacher training, regardless of their other qualifications or experience. The number of unqualified teachers in free schools and academies has gone up from 2,200 in 2010 to 5,300 last year, according to Education Department figures, although the overall number of unqualified teachers in the state sector as a whole has fallen. In his speech, Mr Clegg announced that, from September next year, the government would create a "programme to get outstanding leaders into the schools that need them the most". The team would be made up of head teachers and deputy heads, with recruitment beginning soon, he said. Parts of the Liberal Democrat leader's speech had been heavily trailed in the media for several days, particularly his expression of differences with the Conservatives over free schools, which are state-funded but autonomous. He acknowledged "differences of opinion, some strongly held", stating that his party wants all schools to follow the national curriculum, guarantee food standards and employ only qualified teachers. He said this "view has sparked quite a bit of excitement this week - and criticism", but added that he wants parents to make their educational choices "safe in the knowledge that there are certain safeguards". Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position on free schools, saying that, as recently as last week, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Clegg said: "I am totally unapologetic that the Liberal Democrats have our own ideas." Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Nick Clegg will be judged on what he does, not what he says. "Whatever he says about free schools today, the truth is this divisive policy is his - enacted by his Tory-led government because of his help and support." </body>

      <title>Cameron has lost control - Miliband</title>
      <description>David Cameron has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Tories and Lib Dems on energy policy, Labour leader Ed Miliband is to say.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy, Labour leader Ed Miliband is expected to say. The Tory prime minister has promised to review green taxes in an effort to cut gas and electricity bills. But the Lib Dems said the announcement represented a "panicky U-turn". In a speech, Mr Miliband will accuse the PM of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs. But Downing Street said the prime minister's green taxes review would help consumers. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks. Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs for 20 months if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, his Conservative predecessor as prime minister, Sir John Major, called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. In a speech in London later, Mr Miliband is expected to say: "Yesterday was the day David Cameron lost control of his government. In weakness and panic, he made up a policy on energy which means business as usual for the energy companies and which is already falling apart. "There is no solution to the cost of living crisis which tiptoes around taking on the energy companies and reforming a broken market. "But this prime minister is too weak to stand up for the consumer and he always takes the side of the big six companies." Mr Miliband will say 27 million households and 2.4 million families would benefit from Labour's promised price freeze. He will add: "Sir John Major recognises that the job of government is to reform markets when they are failing and to protect people. This prime minister does not." But Mr Cameron argues that a price freeze would not work. At Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, he accused his rival of "acting like a con man". He said gas and electricity bills were at "unacceptable levels" and green taxes were contributing Â£112 a year to the average annual dual fuel bill. But Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary." Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey is due to set out details of the competition review next week. But his party, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, wants to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior Lib Dem source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average Â£1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion, at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Angela Knight, chief executive of the power industry group Energy UK, told BBC Breakfast it was not aware in advance that Mr Cameron was going to announce a review of green taxes. She said: "Statements are made by politicians in the House of Commons and that's absolutely fine but I think it is very much in the interests of everyone that we can get into the details and decide exactly how we are going to proceed with some of these additional costs." While it was not yet clear what exactly the government was going to look at cutting, she said "there are some costs which if they are relieved off the bill then yes it will make a very decent and good difference to households and it will do it quickly". </body>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for Â£112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average Â£1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <body>David Cameron has announced a review of green energy taxes, saying they have helped push up household bills to "unacceptable" levels. The prime minister says he wants to "roll back" environmental regulations and charges, and establish a new competition test for suppliers. But Labour leader Ed Miliband has said Mr Cameron is "changing his policy every day" and what was needed was a price freeze. Nick Robinson reports. </body>

      <body>Workers at the Grangemouth complex have been told that its petrochemical plant is to be closed, with the loss of about 800 jobs. Owner Ineos claimed the decision had been forced by the refusal of workers to accept changed contracts. The company has yet to say when the neighbouring refinery will be started up again. One contractor at the site said: "A lot of subbies will lose their jobs now because Ineos will not take a pension cut." An Ineos employee told BBC News: "Some people are a bit annoyed, most people are just worried as it's nearly Christmas. That's the general consensus." </body>

      <description>Straw houses and other secrets of cutting energy bills</description>

      <body>What do an Australian accountant living in south-west London, a 65-year-old sheep farmer in Wales, and council tenants in a rural Lincolnshire district have in common? The answer is a passion for energy efficiency that means that they will not be hit as hard as most by the latest round of gas and electricity price rises. They have built or live in properties where the insulation drastically reduces the need for heat. "You have to plug the gaps, otherwise it is like pouring water into a leaky bucket," says Peter Urquhart, the Aussie who has created an eco home in North Cheam. His project is no grand design, but a two-bedroom, timber-framed bungalow which his neighbours refer to as "the shed". Close to completion in a suburban estate opposite a primary school, only the modern chimneys protruding from the slanting low-rise roof give any clue that this property is different. But inside, skylights mean the rooms are filled with natural light and there is a ventilation system which allows the stale air going out to heat the fresh air coming in. Solar panels lay flat against the roof, creating energy for the underfloor heating. "It is unusual, but it is a home at the end of the day," says 36-year-old Mr Urquhart. The project, he says, took a lot more time, energy and money than he expected. Yet, for him, the reward is displaying an example of what can be done. It is not, he admits, a template for every home in the UK. After all, not everyone has the opportunity to build from scratch, or has the finance to spend upfront. Yet, the Energy Saving Trust says there are small changes that people can make to their homes to make them more energy efficient, and cut bills. They include the use of energy saving lightbulbs, turning off unnecessary lights, setting the washing machine to 30C, or wrapping hot water tanks in decent insulation. Mr Urquhart's motivation was his concern for the environment - a view shared by his wife Lucy. The result is a property which, he estimates, has only a third of the energy needs of an equivalent Victorian home - and 40% of them are provided by the solar panels. The arrival of three-month-old daughter Molly means they have changed their plans to move in, so now they want to sell before embarking on a similar eco home project elsewhere. He is not the only one looking to mirror the design of an energy efficient property. Sheep farmer Anthony Porter has planning permission to build three cottages on his land in the historic county of Radnorshire in Wales. He built the first after reading about American settlers who, despite a shortage of timber, built homes that lasted for more than 100 years. Their, and his, choice of building material was bales of straw. With the price-lifting, profit-making energy industry being portrayed as the big bad wolf, the house made of straw may have worked after all. Lanterns, wind-up torches, a shower warmed by propane gas, and a wood-burning stove nullify the need for mains gas or electricity. The two-bedroom holiday cottage, nestled in idyllic countryside, was built during eight months of huff and puff by Mr Porter and a builder through the winter of 2012. Now it is hired by holiday-makers looking for a break from the gadgets and gizmos of modern life. Mr Porter says it is more fire resistant than a timber-framed house, and carries no greater insurance premium than a standard cottage. The walls are plastered with lime mortar and the roof space is insulated with sheep's wool, meaning the whole building, excluding the land and his own labour, cost Mr Porter Â£31,700. "It was quite a leap of faith," he admits. It was even more of a gamble for the councillors of North Kesteven in Lincolnshire to spend taxpayers' money on building the first straw bale social housing in the country in 2010. But, after looking at the figures, they were convinced it would pay off. The three-bedroom family homes each had a building budget of Â£110,000, which the council says is Â£20,000 less than a brick-built home of the same size. They also feature sheep's wool insulation, solar panels and triple glazing, resulting in an average saving of 44% in running costs, the council estimates. Critics of straw bale homes say that the thickness of the walls means there is less space in the house than with more standard walls. The need to keep them free of leaks and moisture is also vital. More significantly, most homeowners and tenants do not have the opportunity to bypass big energy bills in the same way, especially if they are living in draughty, Victorian homes. While these projects provide an advert for insulation, very few people have signed up to the Green Deal - a scheme in England, Wales and Scotland through which householders can borrow money to install double-glazing, loft insulation, and more efficient boilers. Enthusiasts of self-built homes argue that building a home from scratch means a range of energy efficient installations would be easier to include than in older homes. Self-build is a sector being encouraged by the government with tax breaks, despite the fact that those who want to build their own homes often complain of a shortage of land, planning difficulties, and a lack of mortgage products to finance the project. "With the lack of new homes being built at the moment, you would have thought more lenders would be offering self-build mortgages. Many of the banks and building societies quietly pulled out of the market citing a lack of demand for their mortgages," says Aaron Strutt, of mortgage brokers Trinity Financial. And there is an added irony. The energy companies are suggesting that government-imposed "green" levies are getting more expensive and are pushing up bills for consumers. There is little doubt that before a solution is reached, and before eco homes become less of a novelty, household energy costs will keep on rising. </body>

      <title>Bustling market towns hold the secret of happiness</title>
      <description>Do market towns hold key to happiness?</description>

      <body>Britain's bustling market towns are hailed as the places containing the secrets of happiness. New government research on life satisfaction concludes that cities and smaller towns should try to replicate the community spirit, thriving high streets and social networks of large rural and market towns. Data released by the Office for National Statistics reveals that the least happy areas in the UK are Harlow and Brentwood - both in Essex. The happiest are Fermanagh and Moyle, both in Northern Ireland. But why should that be? Identifying the factors that are linked to high levels of life satisfaction is one of the aims of the government's well-being programme. The idea is that ministers can then tailor policies to fit. What today's government analysis reveals is that happier places tend to have lower levels of ill-health, crime and unemployment. So far, so unsurprising. They also have higher levels of retired people and young couples without children. Among other factors linked positively to life satisfaction are "working from home", a rural community and volunteering. Among the negative factors are "women working full time", lone parent households and higher numbers of newly settled migrants. The data only identifies correlation rather than cause, so it may be that the correlation with the number of migrants, for example, may reflect an area's relative deprivation. The places with highest levels of life satisfaction tend to be larger than a small town but smaller than a city. The happiest places of all, it turns out, are larger rural or market towns. The government analysis suggests some of the benefits of market town living be "designed into" other communities. Among the official advice to ministers is the delivery of public services in ways which meet people's needs for social contact - fewer call centres, more real people, perhaps - creating thriving high streets and promoting volunteering. Above all, it seems, the secret of market towns' high well-being levels is their sense of distinct identity, community spirit and perfect size - small enough for people to feel included but large enough to remain private. </body>

      <title>Churchill's 'secret army' bomb plan</title>
      <description>How WWII bomb manuals were hidden in plain sight</description>

      <body>They were Winston Churchill's "secret army", tasked with causing havoc behind enemy lines had the Nazis invaded during World War II. But keeping the identities of the Auxiliary Unit members a secret was crucial to their survival. One of the ways was by hiding bomb-making manuals in plain sight, disguised as old calendars and diaries. Its cover promises agricultural fertilisers that "do their stuff unseen until you see results". But turn the page and a comprehensive guide on where to plant explosives and how to make your own bombs is revealed. The Countryman's Diary 1939 is one of two manuals being auctioned later which shed light on the training and abilities of the guerrilla units. Sponsored by Highworth's Fertilisers - a fictional company named after the Wiltshire town near where the units trained - the diary gives advice on how to set booby traps and kill German troops using household items. It was owned by Louis Pugh who commanded a unit in Tenterden, Kent. The units were formed in 1940 following the Dunkirk evacuation when Churchill became convinced that invasion was imminent. The cells, recruited mainly from men of the Home Guard, were trained to operate independently and sabotage German supply lines as they invaded. The trained killers - who would have become the British resistance movement - were also expected to carry out assassinations. As the owner of a chemical factory, Pugh was deemed suitable to lead a unit that would specialise in using explosives. After training in Wiltshire, he recruited his unit from trusted local men, built a base at Gibbets Oak Farm and stocked it with weaponry. However, according to Jeannette May, senior valuer at Eastbourne Auction Rooms where the manuals are being sold, it had to be abandoned quickly. "It was discovered by a couple of courting lovers who went past and found it," she said. "Pugh took everything back to his house and stored it, while they built a second base. "However, he had a young family at the time and was really worried about the repercussions, for his family and village, if the Germans had invaded and discovered it. "It was estimated that the life expectancy for a member of one of the units - had the Germans landed - would've been 10 to 14 days." The manuals are being sold alongside photographs, three booby trap mechanisms and several medals. As the rarest items, the manuals are expected to fetch the most, between Â£500 and Â£800. Mrs May said the mundane nature of the covers would have been thought about at some length. She said: "Perhaps they chose 1937 as the date as they imagine a German sifting through possessions in 1940 would ignore it." Inside, there is matter-of-fact advice on how to kill effectively using home made bombs in cocoa tins. It reads: "The essential point is that for outdoor booby traps you must aim at killing by splinters - not by blast. Another very good method is to use an old motorcycle cylinder filled with gelignite. The fins fly very well." After the threat of invasion passed, the units were disbanded, with Pugh joining the RAF and becoming Flt Lt Pugh. He died in 1984. Mrs May said the items had been handed to the auction house by his stepson, but little else is known about his time with his unit. "Many of them kept it a secret until their deaths - they just wouldn't talk about it," she said. </body>

      <title>Soaring energy bills - can smart technology help?</title>
      <description>Can smart technology help with soaring fuel bills?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24650756</url>

      <body>It is almost the definition of any groundbreaking innovation that it will disrupt a market and its existing players. And if any market needs disrupting right now it is the business of supplying home energy. So two companies which are promising a technology solution that will cut our soaring energy bills should be knocking at an open door. Both firms are in the business of smart thermostats, and they are making big claims about the savings they can offer. The more eye-catching product comes from a business started by a former Apple executive Tony Fadell, who played a big role in the development of the iPod and iPhone. The Nest learning thermostat has the design flair characteristic of his former employer, and has been a big hit at various gadget shows over the last couple of years. The device, which has been on the market in the US for a year or so, gradually gets to grips with your daily routine, and adjusts the temperature accordingly. The firm claims it can save up to 20% on your "heating and cooling bills", and it is known that there are plans to launch in the UK where presumably the accent will be on heating not rather than cooling. Right now, though, Nest is being very cagey about exactly when it will arrive. It seems that the product, advertised in the US as easy to install in about 30 minutes, may have run up against various UK building regulations, so the firm will need to establish a network of engineers to get Nest into homes. So another firm with an established presence in the UK may have a better chance of making an impact. Honeywell's thermostats are already in millions of homes, though most people probably won't remember they've got one because it was installed with a new boiler by the plumber. Now the company is launching something called EvoHome, which it describes as an intelligent wireless heating system, designed to allow you to set different temperatures in different rooms. You have one central control panel, with a connection to your boiler, which then talks wirelessly to up to 12 sensors around your home. The whole system can be adjusted remotely via a smartphone app. Honeywell is selling this as the most practical example yet of the trend towards smart homes - and it certainly looks a lot more useful than those internet-connected fridges we've been hearing about for so long. But it won't be cheap - just a basic setup will cost Â£249, then you'll pay Â£77 for each extra room sensor, plus whatever an engineer charges to install the system. Honeywell claims however that the savings could be very substantial - a reduction of up to 40% in the cost of heating and hot water, which makes up more than 80% of the average household's energy bill. The irony is that the bigger savings will most likely be in bigger homes with lots of unused rooms, the kind owned perhaps by people who are less likely to find it a struggle to pay rising energy bills. And that 40% claim looks pretty optimistic - if consumers find this and similar products deliver much less than than promised, then the reputation of this new industry will take a hit. But energy efficiency has been the missing link in the UK's drive to cut carbon emissions. The government's main policy tool in this area is to introduce smart meters into all homes by 2020, but these will give information on energy use, without necessarily reducing it. So there is plenty of time and room for all kinds of innovative ways of cutting consumption and bills to emerge. And perhaps the big energy firms will get in on the act, promoting intelligent thermostats - although asking companies to put effort into persuading consumers to use less of their product may be wishful thinking. </body>

      <title>John Carpenter reflects on Halloween</title>
      <description>John Carpenter reflects hit horror Halloween as it turns 35</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24296254</url>

      <body>In 1978, a low-budget film about a masked killer stalking a young babysitter in a quiet Illinois suburb took the film industry by storm. Filmed for just over $300,000 (about $1m today), John Carpenter's Halloween has since made more than $47m. Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. "I can believe it," says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. "I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid." Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, "was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders". "The idea was that every American girl can relate to that." After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. "The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was," says the director. "I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it. And I had the movie figured out and it was a lot of fun." Although the idea of a stalking killer was not a new one, having been seen in films like Michael Powell's voyeuristic Peeping Tom; Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13 and even Tobe Hooper's creation Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween's Myers was a different beast. "We had this idea of Michael Myers being not quite a human but almost a supernatural force," says Carpenter. "Evil as a force of nature in the personification of this man. "So we put him in a mask so he wouldn't have human features." The two-dollar rubber mask was a likeness of Star Trek actor William Shatner, sprayed a bluish-white - and it terrified people. "The best compliment I got was standing outside a theatre and hearing the audience scream, that was just delightful." Halloween ushered in the era of the slasher movies of the 1980s. Though they were not the first, it - along with Friday 13th - brought the previously niche horror genre hurtling into the mainstream. Carpenter, however, plays down his reputation as the father of the genre: "I think the main reason that Halloween inspired other movies was very shrewd producers looking and saying, 'This idiot made this for $300,000, we can do it and make money'. "It's all about making money in Hollywood. It wasn't about art." The slasher genre now looks relatively timid when compared with the explosion in what became known as the "torture porn" of the 2000s. Super-violent films such as Hostel and the Saw franchise undoubtedly built on the brutal nature of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Since then, filmmakers have returned to the basics with ghost films like The Conjuring and The Woman In Black, which have proved to be a massive draw at the box office. But Carpenter - who has dabbled in ghostly tales such as The Fog and Christine - again insists: "Horror films have been around since the beginning of cinema and each one leads to another so they continue to morph and change depending on society. "None of this is new, there have always been ghost stories. There are just new ways of telling stories." Though horror makes up the main body of Carpenter's work, the director has branched out into other genres such as the comedy-action of Big Trouble in Little China and the romance of Starman - which earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination. His influence on a younger generation of filmmakers can been seen, in particular in the work of Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn of Drive fame. In a recent BBC interview, he voiced his love for Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York - starring Kurt Russell as the anti-hero Cyclops Snake Plissken whose mission is to rescue the US president from the Big Apple - now a maximum security prison. "God, I loved that movie," said Refn. "It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulsey beat." Carpenter, roaring with laughter, is clearly delighted with the compliment: "Hell yes," he cackles. "Who wouldn't be?" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Carpenter is blessed indeed, for alongside the seven sequels to Halloween, no fewer than four of his films have been remade in recent years, with an adaptation of Escape from New York long rumoured. British actors Jason Statham and Tom Hardy are believed to be front-runners to take over the role of Plissken. "I'm mostly extremely excited, especially when they have to pay me money," says Carpenter. "I made my films and the remakes are the remakes, so its fine with me." After 43 years in the film business, Carpenter is now semi-retired but offers a word of advice to young filmmakers. "The biggest challenge is surviving the movie business and making films despite all the obstacles in your way," he says. "Nobody tells you how to survive. "I don't know if I'm as hungry as I was. I'm not as driven as I was, my entire life's goal was to become a professional director and I did that, I've nothing left to prove to myself." A 35th anniversary edition of Halloween is out on 21 October. </body>

      <title>Tinie Tempah: 'I believe in the magic of music'</title>
      <description>Tinie Tempah on the mysteries of his new album</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24582845</url>

      <body>Brit Award-winning UK rapper Tinie Tempah tells how Adele helped him pick the songs for his new album - and why his old school might not like it. Tinie Tempah has no eyes on the cover of his new album. They've been scratched out, painted over. And deliberately so. "I'm trying to make it about the music again," he explains. "It felt like I was starting to become a personality. People were starting to know me for lots of other things, which is cool, but I just want it to be about the music. "Don't look at the eyes, listen to the voice, hear what I'm saying." Coming to terms with fame is a recurring theme of the star's second album, called Demonstration. "Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?" he asks on Children of The Sun. On Looking Down The Barrel, the rapper admits: "When I'm near the public for too long, I act fidgety." "You can definitely hear me battling to hold onto that sense of normality and reality, as opposed to being thrown into this mad world of celebrity," says the 24-year-old. The success of his Mercury-nominated debut made Tinie a tabloid fixture - linked with Rihanna and Nicole Scherzinger in the gossip columns. But thankfully his new album isn't an awful "tears of a pop star" sobfest about empty hotel rooms and emptier relationships. Instead, he lists his distractions - New York fashion week, partying in Las Vegas - before admonishing himself: "Oy oy, mate, don't sell out!" "The most important thing is self-awareness," he says - but witty lyrics help, too. He writes, on the Daft Punk-referencing Lover Not A Fighter - about meeting his old teacher, who declares herself a fan and tries (successfully) "to get in my jeans". Is it a true story? "It's not directly literal," he laughs. "Without sounding un-gentlemanly, it may not necessarily have been 'my teacher', but it could have been 'a teacher.'" Nonetheless, he's keen to find out how the song is received in his old school staff room. "It's going to be like a game of Cluedo! They're going to be looking around - 'was it you?'" Born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu, Tinie Tempah grew up in the notorious, now-condemned Aylesbury estate in Peckham. His parents had come to the UK from Nigeria in their 20s. His father, a barber, retrained as a social worker and his mother worked as a human resources officer. By the time Tinie was 12, they had saved enough money to move to Plumstead - a short walk from the O2 Arena, which he headlines in December. The youngster picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology. But his life changed when he saw the music video for So Solid Crew's 21 Seconds: Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double-glazing to fund his first music video, and was being played on radio stations like KISS and BBC Radio 1Xtra before he signed a record deal with Parlophone in 2009. Five of the singles from his first album, Disc-Overy, hit the UK top 20 - while the inspirational, rap-rock crossover Written In The Stars made him a star in America, too. But the follow-up was delayed while his record label Parlophone changed hands, as part of the huge Universal-EMI merger. "There was a holding period where I could release the album in England, but I wouldn't have been able to release it in the rest of the world," says the musician. "It was a mad, compromising time. I remember Coldplay had just brought out their album and Chris Martin said to me, 'everyone who got out their album at the start of the year was lucky because there's going to have to be a long wait.'" Tinie filled the time writing new songs, and releasing others for free online. "I've realised more and more you need to get your ideas out," he says. "Unless you know you've made another Heal The World, I don't think you should hold on to music. "If you empty your tank it'll refill again." Forever attired in a tailored jacket, dark blue denim and his trademark, thick-rimmed spectacles, Tinie was named Britain's best-dressed man by GQ Magazine two years ago. He told the editors he maintained a sharp appearance because "it would be weird if I was wearing exactly what someone in the crowd was wearing. What would set me aside from them?" But off-stage, he is determined to stay grounded. His cousin is his manager, he's constantly in touch with his mum, and everyone has the right to put him in his place. "I don't consider myself a crazy person, so if I do get a good telling-off, I usually know it's for something worthwhile," he says. He's coy about his transgressions, though - admitting only that he gets carried away in clothes shops. "People will say, 'you're never going to wear that, you're getting excited,'" he laughs. "I'm not off the rails... yet, anyway." However, he can't help referencing his new-found wealth on his record. Lines like "I'm putting on the pounds but I ain't gaining weight" permeate the new album - but does he worry that bragging about success will alienate fans? "I definitely do think that," he says, "but all these things are happening to me and you can't not say it. "You know when you've put a lot of water in a balloon, and it's getting bigger and bigger? Sometimes I just want to burst with excitement - and where else should I say that, if not in my music?" He hopes the lyrics give fans something to aspire to - the same way So Solid Crew inspired him. "I always feel an obligation to anybody who's trying to be like me," he says. "I'm a British musician and I'm very much in pop culture - but I have come from grime, a genre of music which is still very niche, and is still very underground." "Given where I've come from, there's an obligation to say, 'you know what? The world is a big place, and the moment I left here and applied myself, great things happened.'" He certainly moves in high circles. He got feedback on the new album from Coldplay's Chris Martin, while Adele advised him on the track list. He's also been picking up tips in Hollywood. "I was lucky enough to go to Jennifer Lopez's house [and] she basically said to me that anybody at the top of their game is constantly still studying their craft. "She gave me an example of the fact that Will Smith, whenever he shoots a movie, still has his acting coach on the other side of the camera. "Even though he's at the top of his game, he still wants to learn. It's such a humbling thing for me, you know, so that was a really good bit of advice." Unsurprisingly, his ambitions are global: Hearing Beyonce sing Irreplaceable in Spanish (Irreempazable) made him realise that success wasn't just determined by breaking America. "Playing in Kuala Lumpur or Sri Lanka is just as good a feeling as playing in America," he says. "It's just about being as big an artist as I can be. "I believe in the magic of music. Hopefully one day I'll make the right song, or the right album, that will impact the whole world." Tinie Tempah releases the single Children of the Sun on Monday, 28 October. His album, Demonstration follows on 4 November. </body>

      <body>A newly christened prince beams out from many of the front pages. The Daily Express has a close-up of him held in his father's hands and the caption: "Meet George, your future king." For some of the papers it is the only story on the front page, along with further sobriquets. He is "the perfect prince" in the Daily Telegraph. In the Daily Mail's picture, the expression on his face is somewhat regal, or at least, he is not smiling. "HRH Grumps," it says, "but by George, he's gorgeous." "Gorgeous George" is what the Times calls him too, on a picture that takes up the entire front and back page. The Sun synthesises all that into one brand new word - "Georgeous". A woman on a mobile phone is pictured in close-up on the Guardian's front page - German chancellor Angela Merkel. The paper believes the claims that the US has been snooping on her calls have shifted the furore over the scale of American mass surveillance to "incendiary levels". The Daily Telegraph talks of the White House "scrambling to head off a major diplomatic incident". According to the Independent, it was "a dark day for Grangemouth" - and "a potentially calamitous one for the UK's energy supply". The Financial Times says the decision by Ineos to shut the petrochemical plant has sent shockwaves through Scotland's manufacturing sector and the wider UK chemicals industry. The Guardian sees it as a "shattering blow" for the immediate community - and one which seriously bruises Holyrood's hopes of a viably independent Scottish economy. The Times accuses the Unite union of "failing its members at Grangemouth" - and says "the largest industrial complex in Scotland may soon cease to exist because of Unite's enthusiasm for conflict with management". The Daily Mail has a picture of a group of Romanian policemen - in London. It says eight officers from Romania and three from Poland have been drafted in by Scotland Yard to help British forces combat an eastern European crime wave. They will apparently do a two-year tour of duty, helping to identify and deport overseas offenders. Some good news if you cannot start the day without a cappuccino or a skinny latte. The Daily Telegraph reports research in Milan that suggests people who drink three cups of coffee halve the risk of getting liver cancer. However, the scientists are not sure whether it is thanks to the coffee or whether coffee drinkers simply have lifestyles that are healthier in other ways. Finally, several papers report a mysterious humming that has been plaguing residents near Hythe in Hampshire. The Sun says fed-up locals have been kept awake for a week by the nightly din - some have had to sleep on friends' sofas outside the area to escape the noise. Scientists think it may come from fish in a nearby estuary. They say the "midshipman fish" produces a droning sound from its swim bladder to attract females. It can go on for hours - and often gets louder as males try to out-hum each other. </body>

      <title>Poor care risk 'at 1 in 4 hospitals'</title>
      <description>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows.</description>

      <body>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows. The findings are based on monitoring by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of a host of data, including death rates, serious errors and patient surveys. It found 44 out of 161 trusts fell into the two highest risk categories. The exercise has been carried out as part of the regulator's new hospital inspection regime, which will see inspectors go into every trust by 2015. The first inspections got under way in September and by Christmas the first 18 will have been completed. It will result in every trust being given a rating of either 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' as part of a shake-up in the system ordered after the Stafford Hospital scandal. The CQC said the latest information was not a final judgement, but would be used to prioritise which trusts to inspect earlier in the process. Hospital chief inspector Prof Sir Mike Richards likened the risk review to a form of "screening". He added: "Our intelligent monitoring helps to give us a good picture of risk within trusts, showing us where we need to focus our inspections." The regulator has assessed each trust's performance against up to 150 different indicators. Those performing worse than would be expected on each indicator get marked down as being at risk or elevated risk for that topic. The number of risk scores they have determines which of the bands they are placed in. Bands one and two - those at highest risk - include 24 trusts and 20 trusts respectively. The trusts in band one include the 11 trusts already placed in special measures after a review of high mortality rates. They are joined by Croydon Health Services, which was rated high risk in 12 areas for issues such as patient survey results and whistle-blowing. Also in band one are Barking, Havering and Redbridge, which was rated high risk in 13 areas including AandE waits and patient surveys, and Aintree, rated high risk in 11 areas including an elevated risk for mortality rates. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon, who is also a CQC board member, said: "It makes sense to use the wealth of routinely available data in the NHS to try to spot patterns which might identify or predict poor quality care for patients. "The intelligent monitoring tool can never by itself be a crystal ball, but it is a great start and will surely develop over time." Labour Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said: "David Cameron should be ashamed that he's put so many of England's hospitals in this position. "He siphoned Â£3bn out of the NHS front-line to blow on a back-office re-organisation nobody voted for. Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos." Use the table below to see how your local trust is rated. Select Trust Name to sort alphabetically or Band to sort by band. Each trust has been put into one of six bands. Bands one and two are the ones classed as high risk, while five and six are the lowest risk. Not all the indicators are applicable to every trust - so trusts have only been assessed against the one relevant to them and a proportionate risk score has been calculated. Where serious concerns have been expressed about a trust already, such as being placed in special measures, the organisation is automatically placed in band one regardless of the risk score. The trusts marked with an * are those that have been elevated for this reason. Source: Care Quality Commission </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <title>Daily aspirin 'risky' for healthy</title>
      <description>Healthy people should not take aspirin to ward off heart attacks and cancer, according to the most comprehensive review of the risks and benefits.</description>

      <body>Healthy people should not take aspirin to ward off heart attacks and cancer, according to the most comprehensive review of the risks and benefits. There has been growing debate about whether all people over 50 should take a daily, low dose aspirin. But the review, conducted by the research arm of the NHS, said it was a "fine balance" due to the dangers of bleeding in the brain and stomach. Overall it warned against taking the drug, until there was more evidence. Aspirin makes the blood less sticky so it reduces the odds of a blood clot forming inside the body, which could cause a heart attack or stroke. There are even studies suggesting it can cut the risk of some cancers. However, as the drug makes it harder for the blood to clot it can cause problems inside the body. The drug is given to people at high risk of a heart attack or stroke as the medical benefit is clear. However, there have been calls to give aspirin to otherwise healthy people as well. A team at Warwick Medical School was asked to assess the evidence by the NHS National Institute for Health Research. For heart attacks and strokes, they concluded giving everyone aspirin would cause "net harm due to increased potential for bleeding". This was in part due to better management of at-risk patients including prescribing drugs to lower blood pressure. On cancer, they concluded the evidence was not strong enough to base a decision on, but trials taking place would give clearer proof in the next five years. Prof Aileen Clarke, who led the review, told the BBC: "The risks are finely balanced and for now there is not the evidence to advise people to take it. "It would be lovely to say over-50s should take an aspirin a day and have much less cancer, but the research hasn't yet been done and we should be cautious. "We need to be extremely careful about over-promoting aspirin." </body>

      <title>US health chief becomes new NHS boss</title>
      <description>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service.</description>

      <body>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service. Simon Stevens, who has worked as an NHS manager and acted as a health adviser to Labour, will take over from Sir David Nicholson in April. Mr Stevens is currently working for United Healthcare as its global health president. His appointment comes at a challenging time for the health service. While the NHS budget has been protected - it is rising 0.1% each year at the moment - the settlement still represents the biggest squeeze on its funding in its history. This is happening at a time when there are growing demands for care. There have already been signs the NHS is struggling to cope. Last winter pressure on AandE units meant the waiting time target was missed from January to March. Meanwhile, a growing number of trusts are running up deficits. As chief executive of NHS England, Mr Stevens will have control over the day-to-day running of the health service. Mr Stevens would be paid the same as Sir David - Â£211,000 per year - but had offered to take a 10% pay cut in the first year due to "NHS spending pressures", NHS England said. He will draw a salary of Â£189,900 in the first year. Christina McAnea, head of health at the union Unison, sounded a note of caution about Mr Stevens' appointment. She told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: "I am surprised that they haven't been able to find someone within the NHS... and somewhat concerned that this is the Tory-Lib Dem government trying to install American medical values." Ms McAnea said she hoped it was not a "surreptitious attempt" to move away from the NHS values of "free medicine for all" But the chairman of NHS England, Sir Malcolm Grant, said they wanted to do a global search and believe Mr Stevens is the right person to lead the health service through the coming years. Sir Malcolm told the Today programme: "We wanted the best in the world and we've got I think the best in the world. Of course we've got somebody who's got experience both of the public health system in this country and of the best of American healthcare. "The NHS has to be open to ideas from across the world. All nations are facing a crisis in the affordability of healthcare and the American experience is valuable to us." Mr Stevens said: "It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our health service." NHS England chairman Prof Sir Malcolm Grant said: "I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. "We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. "I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy." Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Simon has an extraordinary reputation in the UK and abroad as a reformer and an innovator, and we are lucky to have someone of his calibre doing such a vital role. "He will make a key contribution to the two biggest challenges facing the NHS right now - how to raise standards of care and also be financially sustainable. "His passion for our universal health service free at the point of use goes back many years but he will add international expertise as we face the challenges ahead." The announcement comes after Sir David said in May he was stepping down after seven years leading the health service. He had faced repeated calls to resign over his role in the Stafford Hospital scandal. Sir David spent 10 months in charge of the local health authority in 2005 and 2006 at the height of the problems. </body>

      <title>GPs 'over-prescribe' antibiotics</title>
      <description>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many drugs being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University.</description>

      <body>GPs wrongly assume that patients want antibiotics resulting in too many being prescribed, according to a Europe-wide study by Cardiff University. Research showed that for patients with an acute cough the drugs made little difference to their recovery time. Experts have voiced concern that over-prescribing antibiotics helps bacteria become increasingly resistant, making the drugs ineffective. The study involved more than 3,400 people across 13 countries. Since their arrival in the 1940s, antibiotics have been on the frontline of medicine's battle against disease. But experts are warning they are becoming increasingly ineffective at a rate that is alarming and irreversible because bacteria is becoming resistant to them. Researchers at Cardiff and at Antwerp University in Belgium said an acute cough was one of the most common reasons for consulting and for prescribing antibiotics in primary care. Patients taking part in the study were asked if they expected, hoped for or asked for antibiotics when consulting their doctor for acute cough. Researchers found that the recovery time taken for patients remained largely the same, whether or not they expected, hoped for, asked for and/or received a prescription. The study revealed that patient satisfaction with the consultation remained high, whether or not patients actually received antibiotics from their doctor. However, those who had hoped for antibiotic treatment, but did not receive it, were less satisfied. Dr Nick Francis from the Cardiff University School of Medicine, who is also a GP in Ebbw Vale, said GPs prized their relationships with their patients, and may prescribe antibiotics because they feared "bad press" if patients did not get well. "But we are saying you can maintain that relationship by equipping patients with good information about what they should be watching out for," added Dr Francis, who has been a GP for nearly 20 years. "It's a safer approach and they can come back to the doctors once they know what to look out for." Dr Francis said there were also fears that over-prescribing antibiotics could result in bacteria becoming more resistant to them. He added: "The study provides clear evidence that patient views are not associated with illness severity and is therefore unlikely to represent a rational reason for prescribing antibiotics. "Moreover, clinicians are not good at correctly assessing patient views on use of antibiotics. "We believe it is likely that satisfaction could have been increased through enhanced communication, as has been found in previous studies." Last year, Dr Robin Howe of Public Health Wales said increasing resistance to antibiotics could lead to more illness and deaths. Dr Howe said clinicians and patients must accept they could only be used when they had most benefit. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <title>TB challenge over 'missing' millions</title>
      <description>About three million people who developed tuberculosis in 2012 have been "missed" by health systems, the World Health Organization says.</description>

      <body>About three million people who developed tuberculosis in 2012 have been "missed" by health systems, the World Health Organization has said. Finding these missed cases is one of the biggest challenges in TB care and control, the WHO's report says. Twelve countries including India, South Africa and Bangladesh account for the majority of undiagnosed individuals. But the WHO says the target to halve the number of TB deaths by 2015 is still within reach. Global TB programme director Dr Mario Raviglione said 56 million people had been cured and 22 million lives had been saved in the past 15 years and half of the highest-burden countries were on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals targets, but there remained a number of major challenges. "The two major challenges we identified are that of detecting in the system what we call the missed cases," he told the BBC. " There are about three million people that we estimate had TB and that are not officially in the system, that are not reported. "Some of them may actually be never detected, some of them are in fact hidden in the private sector, in the non-state sector, that does not notify the cases. "So that is I think one of the biggest challenges we have to face and there are opportunities there because we know where these cases may be." The WHO says TB testing services need to be urgently improved in many countries, with help from non-governmental organisations NGOs and volunteers. And in others, particularly Asian countries, more needs to be done to ensure figures on TB are compiled and reported centrally. The other major challenge highlighted is drug-resistant TB. The WHO estimates that 450,000 people became ill with multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in 2012. China, India and Russia have the highest rates. But the report adds that by 2012, deaths from TB had been reduced by 45% since 1990, meaning the target of a 50% reduction by 2015 is within reach. Charity Medecins Sans Frontieres' (MSF) infectious disease specialist Dr Philipp du Cros said: "Three in four people with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis are still not diagnosed, and 17,000 of those diagnosed in 2012 did not even start treatment." He said: "These shocking figures are an indictment of the global failure to tackle drug-resistant tuberculosis head on. People are paying for this failure with their lives." Dr Du Cros added: "Unless we take urgent action, we will continue to see an increase in harder-to-treat drug resistant strains of TB." He said more research was needed to make treatments for TB shorter, more effective and less damaging for patients. "An extra $2bn was needed to plug a funding gap in the treatment of TB, he added. </body>

      <title>Saturated fat heart disease 'myth'</title>
      <description>The risk from saturated fat in foods such as butter, cakes and biscuits is being overstated and demonised, according to a cardiologist.</description>

      <body>The risk from saturated fat in foods such as butter, cakes and fatty meat is being overstated and demonised, according to a cardiologist. Dr Aseem Malhotra said there was too much focus on the fat with other factors such as sugar often overlooked. It is time to "bust the myth of the role of saturated fat in heart disease", he writes in an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal. But the British Heart Foundation said there was conflicting evidence. It added reducing cholesterol through drugs or other means does lower heart risk. Studies on the link between diet and disease have led to dietary advice and guidelines on how much saturated fat, particularly cholesterol, it is healthy to eat. Millions of people in the UK have been prescribed statins to reduce cholesterol levels. Dr Malhotra, a cardiology registrar at Croydon University Hospital, London, says the "mantra that saturated fat must be removed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease has dominated dietary advice and guidelines for almost four decades". He says saturated fat has been "demonised" and any link with heart disease is not fully supported by scientific evidence. The food industry has compensated for lowering saturated fat levels in food by replacing it with sugar, he says, which also contributes to heart disease. Adopting a Mediterranean diet - olive oil, nuts, oily fish, plenty of fruit and vegetables and a moderate amount of red wine - after a heart attack is almost three times as powerful in reducing mortality as taking a statin, writes Dr Malhotra. However, Prof Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, says studies on the link between diet and disease frequently produce conflicting results. Unlike drug trials, it is difficult to carry out a controlled, randomised study, he says. "However, people with highest cholesterol levels are at highest risk of a heart attack and it's also clear that lowering cholesterol, by whatever means, lowers risk." Cholesterol levels can be influenced by many factors including diet, exercise and drugs, in particular statins, he adds. "There is clear evidence that patients who have had a heart attack, or who are at high risk of having one, can benefit from taking a statin. "But this needs to be combined with other essential measures, such as eating a balanced diet, not smoking and taking regular exercise." Statins are a group of medicines that can help lower rates of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol can also be reduced by eating a healthy, balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight and doing regular physical activity. </body>

      <description>Young black women in the UK are more likely than their white counterparts to develop 'worse' breast cancer, research reveals.</description>

      <body>Young black women in the UK are more likely than their white counterparts to develop "worse" breast cancer with a poorer prognosis, research suggests. This group has larger, more aggressive tumours with a higher risk of recurrence. This is despite having the same access to treatment, the study in the British Journal of Cancer shows. As yet unidentified biological factors may be to blame, say the Cancer Research UK investigators. Such women might respond less well to breast cancer drugs like tamoxifen because of the genetic make-up of their tumour, they say. The research team, based at the University of Southampton, looked at data from nearly 3,000 UK women - of whom 118 were black - who were younger than 40 when they were diagnosed with breast cancer. Even when individual differences such as body weight and treatment variations such as availability of chemotherapy were taken into account, black ethnicity remained an independent indicator of poor prognosis. Dr Ellen Copson and colleagues say there have been similar findings in the US, suggesting this could be an international trend, but further research is needed to try to pin down the exact cause or causes. Early diagnosis may also play a role if black women are less aware of the symptoms or less "breast aware", and so less likely to identify worrying changes, they say. This could mean their cancer is diagnosed at a later stage which would reduce the chance of successful treatment and recovery. Although NHS treatment is designed to be equal for all, some cultural factors such as recent immigration to the UK or language barriers may in practice affect use of health services, they say. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK's head of health information, said: "It's worrying that ethnic background may be a factor influencing a woman's chance of surviving breast cancer. We know that some ethnic populations carry higher genetic risks of getting certain types of breast cancer, but if this difference is down to symptom awareness or access to healthcare, that is particularly concerning. "More research is needed to look into the reason why young black women have higher rates of recurrence, but in the meantime women of any ethnic background should be aware of what is normal for their breasts and get any new lumps or anything unusual checked out by their GP. More often than not breast changes won't mean cancer, but it's best to get any unusual changes checked out." </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <title>NHS 'can save Â£500m' on foreign care</title>
      <description>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe.</description>

      <body>Up to Â£500m could be recovered from overseas visitors and migrants using the NHS every year, ministers believe. An independent report commissioned by the Department of Health estimated these groups cost the NHS Â£2bn a year. Ministers said some of that spending was unavoidable, but said it would be realistic to save a quarter. Savings would come from deterring so-called health tourism, recovering money owed by other countries and a levy on non-European temporary residents. One senior doctor questioned the government's figures and said doctors should not have to spend time "vetting eligibility" of patients. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he did not want to "turn GPs into border guards" and no-one would be denied emergency treatment, but foreign visitors must make a "fair contribution". Mr Hunt said he recognised the NHS's duty of care must "transcend" financial concerns, but collecting an extra Â£500m a year could pay for 4,000 extra doctors. "We have one of the most generous systems in the world when it comes to healthcare for foreign visitors, but it's time for action to ensure the NHS is a national health service - not an international one," he added. The latest research is published in two separate reports by firms Prederi and Creative Research. The government has been criticised for using financial estimates from the Prederi report, but Mr Hunt said it was the "most thorough research there has ever been" in this area. The report itself notes that it is based on "incomplete data, sometimes of varying quality, and a large number of assumptions", but it says the estimates are the "best that can be made at present", and Mr Hunt said researchers had been "completely honest about what they do know and what they don't know". The government is currently consulting on the measures it will take to tackle this issue. It has already announced a Â£200-a-year levy on migrants from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) staying for between six months and five years, and Mr Hunt said this could raise Â£200m a year. A cost-recovery unit will also be set up to help hospitals claw back money they are owed by other governments for treating foreign nationals visiting the UK. Meanwhile, "deliberate health tourism" - whereby people travel to the UK to get NHS care - is estimated by Prederi to cost between Â£60m and Â£80m a year. The report's authors concede this figure is "uncertain" and the "plausible range" of the cost is Â£20m-Â£100m. Frequent visitors "taking advantage" by registering with GPs and getting access to prescriptions and some hospital referrals cost the NHS a further Â£50m-Â£200m a year, the report adds. The government accepts it cannot recoup all of this money and entirely stop health tourism and so it has put forward the "conservative" Â£500m figure. To achieve this, it said a better system of identifying when visitors and migrants got treatment was needed. More details on what this will involve will be revealed in the coming weeks. Free NHS care is offered to anyone with living in the UK who has temporary or permanent permission to do so. Asylum seekers, non-EEA nationals who do not have permission to live in the UK, British ex-pats and visitors usually have to pay for treatment. The UK has reciprocal agreements with most European nations and 28 other countries, and under these visitors are given free NHS care. The NHS should claim these costs back from the relevant governments - but the research suggests just Â£73m a year is recouped out of more than Â£460m at present. This is because there is a perverse incentive in the system whereby if they declare the fact they have treated a foreign national it is up to the individual hospital to chase up the home nation for the money whereas if they do not declare it they get money from the NHS system for seeing a patient entitled to care. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: "We are not against improving the recovery of costs from people with no entitlement to NHS treatment." But he added the figures were based on a "large number of assumptions" and was more about "spin than substance". Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, said the government's Â£500m savings figure was "exaggerated", partly because it did not take account of the costs of implementing its plans. He said migrants paying the proposed Â£200-a-year levy could be more likely to use the NHS to "get their money's worth", and he said the cost of a single hospital outpatient appointment would be more than Â£200. Dr Nagpaul said doctors should not be distracted from their work in order to check the eligibility of patients for treatments. Dr Clare Gerada, chairwoman of the Royal College of GPs, said it was imperative GPs were not tasked with being a "new border agency" in policing the NHS. "The risks to public health that will arise from these proposals are also very real. They will deter people from seeking medical help in the early stages of illness when they can be dealt with cost-effectively and efficiently in primary care, rather than requiring expensive specialist care and increasing admissions to emergency departments," she said. Jonathan Portes, of the Institute of Economic and Social Research think tank, said the research revealed the extent of deliberate health tourism had been "hugely overstated" and was in fact a "very small part of NHS expenditure". </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Child bone-marrow transplant 'first'</title>
      <description>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique for sick children.</description>

      <body>Doctors at London's Great Ormond Street Hospital have carried out a pioneering bone-marrow transplant technique. They say the method should help with donor shortages since it does not require a perfect cell match. Mohammed Ahmed, who is nearly five years old, was among the first three children in the world to try out the new treatment. He has severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome and had been waiting for a suitable donor for years. Mohammed, who lives in Milton Keynes, was referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital when he was a year old. His condition - a weak immune system - makes him more susceptible to infections than most, and a bone marrow transplant is the only known treatment. While Mohammed was on the transplant waiting list, he became extremely sick with swine flu. At that time, his doctors decided Mohammed's only real hope was to have a mismatched bone-marrow transplant, with his father acting as the donor. Mohammed's dad, Jamil, agreed to give the experimental therapy a go. Before giving his donation, Jamil was first vaccinated against swine flu so that his own bone-marrow cells would know how to fight the infection. Mohammed's doctors then modified these donated immune cells, called "T-cells", in the lab to engineer a safety switch - a self-destruct message that could be activated if Mohammed's body should start to reject them once transplanted. Rejection or graft-v-host disease is a serious complication of bone-marrow transplants, particularly where tissue matching between donor and recipient is not perfect, and is one of the most difficult challenges faced by patients and their doctors. Mismatched transplants in children - where the donor is not a close match for the child - are usually depleted of T-cells to prevent graft-v-host disease, but this causes problems in terms of virus infections and leukaemia relapse. The safety switch gets round this - plenty of T-cells to be transfused and later killed off if problems do arise. Thankfully, the transplant carried out in 2011 was a success - Mohammed's doctors did not need to use the safety switch. Although Mohammed still has to take a number of medicines to ward off future infections, his immune system is now in better shape. Jamil said: "We waited for a full match but it did not come. By the grace of God, we took the decision to have the treatment. "Now he is all right. Sometimes we forget what he has been through. We are just so grateful." He said Mohammed would still need close monitoring and regular health checks over the coming years, but his outlook was good. Dr Waseem Qasim, âconsultant in paediatric immunology at Great Ormond Street Hospital and lead author for the study, said the new approach should hopefully mean children who received a mismatched transplant could enjoy the same chance of success as those given a fully matched transplant. "We think Mohammed is cured of his disorder. He should be able to lead a fairly normal life now." A full report about Mohammed's therapy and the research by Great Ormond Street Hospital, King's College London and the Institute of Child Health has just been published in PLoS One journal. There are currently about 1,600 people in the UK waiting for a bone-marrow transplant and 37,000 worldwide. Just 30% of people will find a matching donor from within their families. Donations involve collecting blood from a vein or aspirating bone marrow from the pelvis using a needle and syringe. </body>

      <body>Calls to shut down a theme park Halloween attraction have been made in a petition whose organisers say it stigmatises mental illness. The Asylum maze has been part of Thorpe Park's annual Fright Nights for more than eight years. Campaigners claim having actors chasing people around an asylum stigmatises mental illness. Thorpe Park said the attraction was not offensive or a realistic portrayal of a mental health institution. A petition organised by Katie Sutton, a mental health nursing student at the University of Salford, has attracted more than 900 signatures. Miss Sutton said she first became aware of the maze through Twitter. "Thorpe Park kept repeating to people that there weren't sufficient complaints. I thought if we can get actual forms of people bothered about it, then it might help." She said the matter had been discussed in one of her university classes and "everyone in the room was absolutely horrified". The charity Rethink Mental Illness has carried out a poll on Twitter to gauge people's views. Paul Jenkins, its chief executive officer, said: "While some people clearly feel very strongly about this, opinion has been mixed. "While of course there's nothing wrong with a bit of Halloween fun, explicit references to 'patients' crosses a line and reinforces damaging stereotypes about mental illness." In September, supermarket chains Tesco and Asda withdrew two Halloween outfits after they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. Asda dropped its "mental patient fancy dress costume", and Tesco later withdrew its "psycho ward" outfit. In a statement, a Thorpe Park spokeswoman said the negative comments were not "universally representative". "This is primarily a matter of context. The maze is not something you happen upon when out shopping," she said. "This maze is also in its eighth year of operation and is an obviously extreme and simulated experience which draws on classic horror film content. "It is not intended, nor is it deemed to be by those who have actually experienced it, to be in any way offensive or to be a realistic portrayal of a mental health or indeed any other institution." </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24402163</url>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <description>Which drink is better for your health?</description>

      <body>One is made of fruit. The other is caffeinated. So a smoothie is a healthier option than a coffee, right? Don't be so sure, says Michael Mosley, as he weighs the evidence. Which is healthier - coffee or smoothies? It seems obvious that the answer must be a smoothie. After all, drinking coffee is a necessary evil while having a smoothie, made from fruit, is part of your five-a-day. But when you look into the scientific studies they reveal something much more surprising. Let's start with coffee. There have been numerous claims down the years that drinking coffee will increase your risk of a whole range of terrible things from heart disease to cancer. These claims have been largely based on case control studies, where you take a group of people who drink coffee and compare them with another matched group who don't. The problem with this approach is that coffee drinkers are more likely than non-coffee drinkers to have other "bad" habits, like drinking alcohol or smoking, so it is hard to tease apart what is really doing the harm. A more reliable way to get at the truth is to do what is called a prospective cohort study. You take a group of disease-free individuals, collect data about them, then follow them for a large number of years to see what happens. When scientists collected data on the coffee drinking habits of 130,000 men and women and then followed them for over 20 years they found that coffee is rather a good thing (The Relationship of Coffee Consumption with Mortality, Annals of Internal Medicine, June 2008). They crunched the numbers and concluded that "regular coffee consumption was not associated with an increased mortality rate in either men or women". In fact, data from this study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is mildly protective, leading to slightly lower all-cause mortality in coffee drinkers than non-coffee drinkers. Based on this and other studies the most effective "dose" is two to five cups a day. More than that and any benefits drop off. There are hundreds of different substances in coffee, including many different flavonoids (compounds widely found in plants that have antioxidant effects). Which of these ingredients is beneficial, we simply don't know. When it comes to the brain, however, the answer seems to be "caffeine". In research recently published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry (July 2013) they found that people who drank two to four cups of caffeinated coffee a day were half as likely to commit suicide as those who either drank decaff or fewer than two cups a day. This research pulled together data from three studies that had followed more than 200,000 people for more than 14 years, so it's pretty reliable. It is also supported by a number of other studies, which makes this claim even more plausible. One reason why caffeine may be a mild anti-depressant is that as well as making you more alert, it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin, that are known to improve mood. The researchers don't recommend going overboard, noting that "there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups". One note of caution is that these trials began many years ago so the sort of coffee consumption being tested is almost certainly good, old-fashioned coffee. A simple mug of coffee delivers somewhere between zero and 60 calories, depending on whether it is black, white or white with one sugar. Cappuccinos, lattes and mochas contain coffee but they also contain a lot of calories - anything between 100 and 600 - so when it comes to fancy coffees I limit myself to the occasional tall, skinny cappuccino (70 calories). But what about fruit smoothies? They may consist of pure fruit but by the time you've got rid of the peel and mashed the fibre then you have already lost many of the potential health benefits. What you are mainly left with is a sugary drink. In a survey published in early 2013, researchers found that out of 52 commercial smoothies, 41 had more sugar than Coca-Cola (a 12oz can contains the equivalent of about nine teaspoons), and all had more calories. Fruit smoothies are acidic and the bits cling to your teeth, so dentists are not enthusiastic. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but not when it's been peeled, blended, mashed and packaged. In a study published in August 2013 in the British Medical Journal (Fruit Consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes) they found that while eating fruit cuts your risk of developing diabetes, drinking it appears to increase the risk. This was another big study involving lots of people followed for many years. An interesting finding was that different fruits gave different levels of benefit. Three servings of blueberries, for example, cut the risk of diabetes by 26%, while eating apples, pears, bananas and grapefruits also had a positive, albeit much smaller, effect. Overall those who ate fruit cut their risk of developing diabetes by 2%, while those who drank it (more than three glasses of fruit juice a week) increased their risk by 8%. More bad news for fruit juice drinkers comes from a case-controlled study done in Western Australia that examined the daily diets of more than 2,000 people. They found that eating some types of fruit and vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and apples) cuts your risk of colorectal cancer, while drinking fruit juice was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Sugary drinks lead to raised levels of the hormone insulin and persistently high levels of insulin are associated with increased risk of some cancers. The researchers point out that many things that protect against bowel cancer, such as antioxidants and fibre, are lost or diminished during the juicing process. None of these studies specifically looked at the health benefits or otherwise of fruit smoothies, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, nor did they look at the impact of different types of juice - for instance, whether it was freshly squeezed or from concentrate, home-made or shop-bought. I would assume, for example, that drinking a home-made vegetable smoothie is going to be a lot better for you than a commercial fruit smoothie. And I very much doubt that the occasional fruit juice or fruit smoothie is going to do any harm. Nonetheless, I've personally given up buying them and we rarely have them in the house. I eat whole fruit and when it comes to soft drinks I'm sticking to water, tea and, of course, coffee.

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naÃ¯ve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24388537</url>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around Â£100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>
      <description>A country where a woman may be jailed for losing a child</description>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages or stillbirths are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited, buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The problem with taking too many vitamins</title>
      <description>Can supplements actually be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24563590</url>

      <body>Millions of people swear by vitamin supplements. But many are wasting their time and some could even be harming themselves, argues Dr Chris van Tulleken. In November 1912 a party of three men and 16 dogs set out from a remote base in eastern Antarctica to explore a series of crevasses many hundreds of miles away. Three months later just one of the men returned. His name was Douglas Mawson. His skin was peeling off and his hair was falling out. He had lost almost half his body weight. He recounted what Sir Edmund Hillary described as "the greatest story of lone survival in the history of polar exploration". A month into their journey, one of the team, along with the tent, most of the provisions and six dogs plunged into a crevasse, never to be seen again. Mawson and the other surviving member, Xavier Mertz, started to return to base, surviving in part by eating the remaining dogs. After a few weeks Mertz developed stomach pains and diarrhoea. Then his skin started to peel off and his hair fell out. He died incontinent and delirious a few days later. Mawson suffered similar symptoms. With the kind of understatement typical of his generation of polar explorers he described the skin of the soles of his feet peeling off: "The sight of my feet gave me quite a shock, for the thickened skin of the soles had separated in each case as a complete layer... The new skin underneath was very much abraded and raw." It was the suffering of early explorers and sailors that motivated the first studies of vitamins and their deficiency diseases. At first sight Mawson's story seems to be another such tale - starvation combined with a lack of some vital nutrient. In fact, Mawson's description of his symptoms is an almost textbook description of vitamin A overdose - probably from eating dog liver. As little as 100g of husky liver could give a hungry explorer a fatal dose. Mawson lived to the decent age of 76 but in his story we find the cautionary tale for our times - vitamins can be very bad for you. This piece is about what we have learned about vitamin supplements in the last few years - if you are healthy, and you live in a country like the UK, taking multi-vitamins and high-dose antioxidants may shorten your life. For most of us, for most of the time, they're unhealthy. "Argh!" I hear you say, "I spend loads of money on them and the claims on the packet are really persuasive. Everything, from my full head of hair to my sex life, depends on them!" I want to get into this in a bit more detail because the vitamin companies certainly don't agree with me. So why do we believe they're useful and why do we take them? Vitamins are essential for life, and there are groups of people even in the UK who benefit from specific supplementation, but general unsupervised vitamin pill-popping is more than just a waste of money. The problem is that we all feel very warm and fuzzy about vitamins because, firstly, the tales of deficiency are so horrific, secondly, we read breakfast cereal packs and thirdly, a double-Nobel laureate called Linus Pauling liked vitamin C in vast, vast doses. All this is packaged by the people now selling us vitamins over the counter into that most beguiling of all logical falsehoods - if a little is good, then more must be better. Now I knew the names of the most obscure vitamins long before medical school because I have always had a fondness for the kind of multicoloured, artificially flavoured breakfast cereals that are marketed using a combination of unlikely cartoon animals and claims of being "vitamin and mineral-enriched". And it has to be said that this vitamin and mineral enrichment of staple food has been one of the most effective public health interventions in history. It continues to save countless lives per year even in Europe. So, while you shouldn't eat dog liver in Antarctica, vitamin A deficiency hugely increases the risk of blindness and death in children with measles and diarrhoea in developing countries. So the World Health Organization recommends a very strict amount and cautions that higher doses can cause birth defects in early pregnancy among other problems. So vitamins do make a huge difference to life expectancy in some circumstances, which is persuasive, and the breakfast propaganda catches us in our most vulnerable, bleary-eyed, early morning state, hinting to us that these vitamins have some sort of catch-all, beneficial effect on our lives, that will transform us into the healthy, energetic beautiful people/cartoon creatures portrayed on the cereal box. These things contribute to a general ideal of healthfulness of vitamins. And then there's Linus Pauling. Whether or not you've heard of him, Linus Pauling is a major influence on vitamin and nutrient culture. It's almost impossible to imagine someone with more authority and credibility. He won two Nobel prizes and was, by all accounts, a genuinely good bloke. He wrote a book in 1970 saying that high doses of vitamin C could be effective in combating flu, cancer, cardiovascular disease, infections and degenerative problems. He took immense quantities himself, hundreds of times the required amount, and lived to a ripe old age surrounded by many great grandchildren. He was the poster boy for mega-dosing of vitamins and this contributed to the growth of an industry supported by the belief that supplementation of these molecules in our diet is beneficial in almost every way imaginable. But rather than taking one man's word for it, however credible, it's worth looking at the results of studies that look at what happens to people who take these supplements for long periods of time. Looking at any one individual study won't be very revealing to answer the question of whether vitamin supplementation is good for you. They're densely scientific and the conflicts of interest can be very hard to spot. For the answer you have to turn to what are called "systematic review papers". This is where independent scientists gather up all the available data and re-analyse it to answer big questions. Here's what a couple of them say: "We found no evidence to support antioxidant supplements for primary or secondary prevention [of diseases of any kind]. Beta-carotene and vitamin E seem to increase mortality, and so may higher doses of vitamin A. Antioxidant supplements need to be considered as medicinal products and should undergo sufficient evaluation before marketing". (See references below). Just to be clear - "increase mortality" - that means they're killing you. These are powerfully bioactive compounds but they're not regulated in the same way as drugs. Whatever you think about the regulation there should surely be a warning on the pack if there's data saying they're bad for us. The next question is - why are they bad for us? It's very hard to pick apart the data, partly because vitamins are a fabulously diverse group of chemicals. I'm going to include what people normally refer to as minerals under the heading of vitamins. They're required in the diet not for energy, but as chemical partners for the enzymes involved in the body's metabolism - cell production, tissue repair, and other vital processes. Their functions are understood largely by their deficiency diseases so we're not exactly sure of precisely what they all do or how they interact. Antioxidants provide a nice example. They soak up the very toxic, chemically-reactive by-products of metabolism called free radicals. These free radicals, left unchecked, can cause damage to DNA and may be linked to cancer. Your cells are full of antioxidants but surely taking more would be better? Right? Keep those cancer causing radicals under control? Well, unfortunately, your body's immune system fights infections by using free radicals to kill bugs. Exactly what effect huge quantities of extra antioxidants could have on this is not clear but it's easy to imagine that it might not be good and you could get more infections. Vitamin A is linked to increasing lung cancer in smokers. Excess zinc is linked to reduced immune function. Long-term excessive intake of manganese is linked to muscle and nerve disorders in older people. Niacin in excess has been linked to cell damage. And so on. And it gets more complicated still when you start mixing everything up in one tablet. For example, different minerals compete for absorption. If you take large quantities of calcium you won't be able to absorb your iron. If you take large quantities of iron you won't be able to absorb zinc. If you take vitamin C you'll reduce your copper level. So it's not just that taking lots of one thing is not good for you, it's that it may cause a dangerous reduction in something else even if you are also supplementing that. To work out the optimal ratios is all but impossible although some manufactures claim to have worked it out. So when are supplements recommended? The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends certain supplements for some groups of people who are at risk of deficiency, including: Your GP may also recommend supplements if you need them for a medical condition. If you decide to take supplements, stick to within the RDA, unless you've had guidance from a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist to exceed the dose. If you've got questions about dosage levels, consult a state-registered dietician or clinical nutritionist. The tales of deficiency combined with the success of enrichment programmes mean that it's easy to make that leap of logic that if a little is good then more must be better. And if you read my article last week on water you'll see where this is going. I could do this every week. The same article. Substitute water for vitamins/probiotics/antibiotics. Don't trust the science done by the people who are trying to sell them to you and don't assume that if some is good more must be better. It's like beer. Or coffee. Or computer games. Goldilocks was right about things needing to be just right. References: Bjelakovic G, Nikolova D, Simonetti RG, Gluud C.

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444431</url>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (Â£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why I write my Down's dad blog</title>
      <description>"The hopes and fears I have for my daughter"</description>

      <body>The Future's Rosie recently won "best new blog" at the MAD (Mum and Dad) Blog awards. In it, Thomas Bachofner documents the progress of his two-year-old daughter, Rosie, who has Down's Syndrome. But why does he blog about it? I'm a graphic designer from Cheshire, not known for writing or reading any books. So it came as a surprise to me that I could even string a sentence together, let alone write a blog that is well received - I'm guessing it's because it comes from the heart. My site is about Rosie's achievements, such as last week when she stood up for the first time, but it also gives me an opportunity to do my little bit towards raising positive awareness of Down's. The first post was published on 14 February 2012 but the idea to share our story with the world came much earlier. When my wife Karen and I learnt that our unborn daughter had Down's syndrome, it was a shock, and it didn't feel like anybody understood our predicament. As a parent, you assume that everything will be fine. Our two boys, Harry and Joe, were born without complications. But we were told about Rosie's condition in such a negative way that we thought it would change our lives drastically for the worse. I found that all I wanted to do was read real-life parent stories from people in our situation, not the science and figures you become bombarded with when searching online. But there weren't many Down's syndrome parenting blogs around at the time and even fewer were written from a dad's perspective. I started to jot things down and was surprised to find that it helped get my emotions out. My scribbles eventually turned into The Future's Rosie which is having more of an impact on me and others than I could ever have predicted. Initially it was a handy way of telling my friends and family how I was feeling and it meant I didn't have to repeat myself over and over at what was a delicate time for me. But many of them began to share it with their friends and, before I knew it, my blog was being read by hundreds of people. I've shared lots of private thoughts about her development and how we as a family are all pitching in to help her. Last year I wrote about what I called "a barbaric-looking developmental aid" given to Rosie by her physio. It's a standing brace and we couldn't get her to use it. She hadn't wanted to walk or crawl, so we got Rosie's brothers to stand on the sofa and blow bubbles which made her reach up and support her body with her legs in order to strengthen them. I've covered learning the Makaton sign language, feeling full of pride when my young sons Harry and Joe stood on stage at school to give a talk about Down's to 250 kids, and I wrote about the weekend we all survived without Mummy being there. One of the hardest things I have done is write about Rosie's surgery. Children with Down's syndrome often have related heart difficulties and Rosie was born with a hole in the heart which needed fixing. My blog entry on that day included post-op pictures of my daughter - it felt like these might be useful for parents to see, if they too have to face the same operation with their Down's syndrome child. As Rosie got older, I quickly learned that my own pre-conceived ideas of Down's were both ignorant and outdated. I wanted to teach others about the reality in a non-patronising manner, so decided to use myself as an example in my own social media campaign. I did it from Rosie's perspective and called it Things I've Taught My Daddy. As with the blog, before I knew it the captioned images I shared on Facebook and Twitter had been seen by thousands worldwide. One of the messages I tried to communicate was that people with Down's are people first and foremost. They are more like their families than they are each other, though many people still find it difficult to see past the physical characteristics associated with the syndrome. Life with Rosie really is very normal, in fact she has been a far easier baby than both her older brothers were. The whole family love her to pieces and I genuinely wouldn't change a single thing about her - well, maybe the volume of her cries when she is hungry. After all "Down's syndrome" isn't who she is, it is just a part of her. Thomas Bachofner blogs at The Future's Rosie You can follow Ouch on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The growth of global immunisation</title>

      <body>Immunisation has been one of the great success stories of global health. It is estimated to prevent the deaths of two to three million children each year. But another 1.5 million children still die from diseases that could be prevented by routine vaccines. The eradication of smallpox in 1980 helped encourage global efforts to fight more diseases through immunisation. These maps chart the growth of global vaccine coverage from 1980 and show which countries are doing best - and worst - at protecting their population. The three vaccines illustrated combat five infections and have been chosen as they demonstrate varying levels of progress against several major diseases. Source: WHO and UNICEF estimates of national routine immunization coverage, 2012 data revision (July 2013). The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that 1.5 million deaths children under five die each year from diseases that could have been prevented by routine immunisation. The chart shows that pneumococcal diseases and rotavirus infection are responsible for around two thirds of these deaths. The former causes pneumonia and the latter is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea. Vaccines against the main causes of both infections have been introduced in the past decade. They are now routinely available in wealthier countries and are being gradually introduced across the developing world. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI) has preliminary plans to support the introduction of rotavirus vaccines in more than 30 of the world's poorest countries by 2015. More than 25 developing countries have begun using pneumococcal vaccines and it hopes to rollout the jab in 45 countries by 2015.

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago (its distance from Earth of 30 billion light-years is because the Universe is expanding). Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <title>Tree pest begins march from Moscow</title>
      <description>The emerald ash borer, a tree-killing beetle that has cost the US economy billions of dollars, could "spread unhindered" across Europe, a study warns.</description>

      <body>An invasive species of beetle that has killed tens of millions of ash trees in North America could "spread unhindered" across Europe, researchers have warned. The emerald ash borer, first recorded in the Moscow area in 2007, has become established in surrounding broadleaved woodlands, they observed. The pest, which is expected to cost the US economy $10bn, has spread up to 25 miles each year, the team estimated. The findings of the survey have been published in the journal Forestry. The team of two UK and two Russian scientists found that the emerald ash borer (EAB) population had spread 146 miles (235km) west of Moscow and 137 miles (220 km) south of the Russian capital city. In their paper, the team described EAB (Agrilus planipennis) as a "major threat to Fraxinus excelsior (European ash), and south of Moscow, where the beetle has become established in natural broadleaved woodlands in which F. excelsior is a major component, many of the ash trees are suffering severe dieback and mortality". They added: "The abundance and almost continuous distribution of F. excelsior in these woodlands means that A. planipennis now has the opportunity to spread unhindered on a broad front to other countries in Europe." Enemy within The beetle is native to north-east China, the Korean peninsula, Japan, Taiwan, Mongolia and the Russian Far East. The beetles' larvae feed on the surface layers of the wood of a tree, cutting off vital supplies of nutrients and water, causing branches and eventually the whole tree to die. Although the adult beetles only live for a matter of weeks, an individual female can lay in excess of 200 eggs during their short lives but the average is estimated to be in the region of 30-60 eggs. While native Asian ash trees appear to have co-evolved resistance to the EAB, US native ash species, such as the green ash (F. pennsylvanica) and white ash (F. americana) have no such resilience, resulting in devastating consequences. Since the first recorded case of an EAB infestation in Michigan back in 2002, the invasive alien species has spread rapidly through 19 US states and two Canadian provinces, leaving a trail of devastation in its trail. The researchers wrote: "The beetle has killed tens of millions of trees over the past 10 years and has raised concerns over the future of ash in North America. "The cost to the US economy over the 10-year period from 2009 to 2019 - in terms of tree removal and replacement alone - is expected to exceed $10bn." Whether a similar fate awaits European ash trees remained uncertain at this stage, explained co-author David Williams, an entomologist from Forest Research, the scientific arm of the UK Forestry Commission. During the summer, Dr Williams and colleague Dr Nigel Straw spent two weeks in and around Moscow to assess the impact and spread of EAB in the area. Dr Williams told BBC News that previous research suggested that an individual beetle would not fly more than six miles (10km) during its lifetime. Yet the team, in their assessment, found evidence that EAB was spreading by up to four times that distance. "There is evidence that the species is riding on vehicles, which is why it is moving long distances," Dr Williams observed. "If it is travelling long distances, it is dependent on a host tree being available for it to jump on to." "To the south of the city, European ash is a component of the natural woodlands. Now that it is established in these woodlands, it is difficult to judge how quickly it is likely to move." He added that it was difficult to quantify the size of the emerald ash borer population that had become established in the woodlands south of Moscow. "Trying to find signs and symptoms of EAB damage is unbelievably difficult in the early stages," Dr Williams explained. "It does seem to be from our observations that it [is] much harder to spot signs and symptoms of EAB damage in European ash than in North American species of ash. "So the fact that it has reached this almost continuous forest of ash into Europe through Belarus and Ukraine is going to [make it] difficult to track its movement." Touch wood The UK is more than 1,500 miles from Moscow, and the Forestry Commission predicts that it is likely to be "many years" before the pest reaches these shores under its own steam. However, a spokesman added: "Regulations are in place to minimise the risk of its accidental introduction in trade and transport, and we are assessing whether more needs to be done to further reduce these risks." He added that the UK and the EU were currently drafting Pest Risk Analyses on EAB. In addition, tree health experts were developing a contingency plan in case there was an EAB outbreak in the UK. The spokesman said that it would follow the same approach used to tackle an outbreak of Asian longhorned beetle in Kent in 2012. And there was a Europe-wide network, known as Fraxback, that allowed scientists across the continent to share their research and findings. Although its efforts were focused on tackling ash dieback, it could provide information that could be used in terms of slowing or halting the spread of EAB. Dr Williams said that during his time in the Russian woodlands, there were signs that some trees may have a degree of resistance to EAB infestations. "European ash is supposed to be much more closely related to Asian ash species than North American species, so that resistance that Asian ash species has to EAB could well be part of genetic make-up of European ash," he suggested. "There was certainly some evidence within Moscow itself. We did not find many European ash but when we did find them, half were looking perfectly healthy. "Perhaps more interestingly, when we moved south into the forests where European ash is much more common, there was a much higher degree of variability in the trees' canopy condition. "This is the opposite of what you find in North American species of ash. When it is attacked by EAB, the dieback is so obvious it is startling. He added: "This suggests that it is perhaps not as susceptible to the beetle as North American species." </body>

      <title>Badger cull extension confirmed</title>
      <description>The badger cull in Gloucestershire is to be extended for eight weeks, Natural England confirms.</description>

      <body>The pilot badger cull in west Gloucestershire will continue for another eight weeks after a licence was granted, Natural England has confirmed. During the six-week period of the original licence, 708 badgers were killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Ministers and the NFU say culling badgers will curb TB in cattle, but protesters say it has little effect. A licence has already been granted to extend the Somerset cull to 1 November. Natural England said it had granted the extension after taking advice from Defra's chief veterinary officer and chief scientific adviser who said failure to extend would raise the risk of increasing the spread of TB by dispersing badgers. The new licence, which runs until 18 December, specifies that a minimum of 540 and a maximum of 940 badgers can be culled in order to control the disease. 'Badger cull madness' As the close season for cage trapping and shooting begins on 1 December, only controlled shooting will be permitted from 1-18 December. Animal welfare charity, Humane Society International (HSI) UK, said it was "appalled" to hear the extension had been granted. The charity said prolonging the shooting "is the very worst thing the government can do because it increases the risk of spreading bovine TB as badgers flee the area". Gloucestershire resident Mark Jones, who is executive director of HSI UK, said: "I am flabbergasted that an eight-week extension has been granted to Defra's badger killing fiasco in Gloucestershire. "By extending culls here as well as in Somerset, the pilots are moving even more dangerously away from the recommendations of the Randomised Badger Culling Trial which were very clear - the longer you subject badgers to this sort of disruption, the greater the risk of worsening the spread of bovine TB among both badgers and cattle. "Surely somebody in government can put a stop to Owen Paterson's badger cull madness before it's too late?" Badger Trust spokesman Jack Reedy said: "It goes against the advice that Defra gave to itself, that it should be a maximum of six weeks. "If they're not following their own terms of reference then that's something that is very actionable so we shall be going either for a judicial review or for an injunction." </body>

      <title>Trees reveal hidden gold deposits</title>
      <description>The detection of gold in tree leaves helps to locate deposits buried in the earth, Australian scientists find, and it could also apply to other metals.</description>

      <body>Money might not grow on trees, but scientists have confirmed that gold is found in the leaves of some plants. Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles in a eucalyptus tree's foliage indicates that deposits are buried many metres below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the sought-after metal in difficult-to-reach locations. The research is published in the journal Nature Communications. Dr Mel Lintern, a geochemist from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), said: "We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia and elsewhere in the world as well. "Now we are trying to tackle finding these more difficult ones that are buried beneath tens of metres of river sediments and sand dunes. "And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this." Buried treasure Gold particles have been found around the soils of eucalyptus trees, but the researchers confirmed that the plants were taking in the element. Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to probe matter in remarkable detail - they found traces of gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amounts of the precious metal were tiny. "We've done a calculation, and found that we need 500 trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring," said Dr Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to greater riches buried more than 30m (100ft) below. Dr Lintern said: "We believe that the trees are acting like a hydraulic pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up through the vascular system into the foliage." Currently, the metal is found in outcrops, where the ore appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling. But the researchers said that analysing vegetation could offer a better method to find untapped gold deposits. Dr Lintern said: "Not only do we believe it is a way of stretching the exploration dollar further, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimises the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground." The researchers said the technique could also be used to find other minerals such as iron, copper and lead in other parts of the world. </body>

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems: PM panicking over energy</title>

      <body>The Liberal Democrats have accused David Cameron of making a "panicky U-turn" after he announced a review of green energy taxes. The prime minister said household bills were at "unacceptable levels" and promised to "roll back" regulations introduced by Labour. But a senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. Labour also criticised the PM, but he promised to help cut people's bills. Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith said Mr Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband were "Muppets" in their attitude to energy policy. Three of the "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10% in recent weeks and Mr Cameron has come under pressure to act, with Mr Miliband pledging to freeze tariffs if his party wins the next general election. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. During Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Mr Cameron said he agreed with his predecessor that charges were "completely unacceptable" and said the government was already intervening in the market to force firms to put customers on the lowest tariff. But, rather than trying to dictate prices or influence the global cost of energy, he said the government's focus was on dealing with the aspects of energy bills it could control. Green taxes, he said, accounted for Â£112 of the average annual dual fuel bill and should be reduced. "We need to help people pay their bill and we need to help to get bills down," he told MPs. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The review would be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it was functioning. Mr Cameron added: "I want more companies. I want better regulation. I want better deals for consumers. But yes, we also need to roll back the green charges that he [Mr Miliband] put in place as energy secretary [under Gordon Brown]." And, speaking to the BBC, he said the coalition had "made huge steps forward in terms of environment policy", but it was right to "look at rolling back the cost of some of these taxes, tariffs and charges". Downing Street said Lib Dem Energy Secretary Ed Davey would set out details of the competition review next week. But the Lib Dems, governing in coalition with the Conservatives, are keen to keep green taxes, arguing that they are essential to creating a sustainable and environmentally friendly energy supply for the UK. A senior source told the BBC: "Everybody knows the Tories are getting cold feet on the environment. The Tories have put no properly worked-up policies in front of us. "But we will not allow a panicky U-turn during PMQs to dictate government policy. The way to provide stable fuel bills now and in the future is not to make policy up on the hoof." The source added that Lib Dems in the coalition would not "allow the Tories to undermine our commitment to the environment, hurt the fuel poor, or destroy our renewable energy industry". "Nick Clegg has always said that we should stress-test every policy to make sure that there isn't a penny more on bills than necessary," they said. "Of course, we will look at the specific details of what the Tories propose. That is coalition government." In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. "He really is changing his policy every day of the week. His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him." However, energy regulator Ofgem rejected Labour's claim that its retail market review had achieved nothing. A spokesman said: "We are introducing the most radical set of reforms to the energy retail market since competition began." He added: "The standards are backed by our powers to levy fines if suppliers don't meet these rules." According to government figures, environmental obligations account for 9% of the average Â£1,267 dual fuel bill, of which carbon taxes make up 2%. The cost of buying energy on wholesale markets makes up the largest proportion. at 47%. Energy firms say profits account for about 5% of an average bill. Asked whether the Lib Dems were signed up to a review, Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps told the BBC that they were "pragmatic" and wanted to see bills coming down. Friends of the Earth's head of campaigns, Andrew Pendleton, said the best way to cut bills was "ending the nation's dependency on costly fossil fuels". But John Allan, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the prime minister's review "could not only help households but also ease the pressure of high energy bills for millions of small businesses too". During a boisterous Prime Minister's Questions session, Mr Cameron was ticked off by Commons Speaker John Bercow for twice describing Mr Miliband as a "con man" in reference to his pledge to freeze bills for 20 months if Labour was elected. Firstly, he contrasted the Labour leader with the former Conservative prime minister, claiming: "Sir John Major is a good man. You are acting like a con man." And in response to a question from Conservative MP Brian Binley, he said: "It simply is the politics of the con man to pretend that you can freeze prices when you're not in control of global energy prices, but the proper approach is to look at what's driving up bills and deal with it." The Speaker said this was "unparliamentary" language and "a bit below the level" expected of a prime minister. Conservative MP and environmentalist Zac Goldsmith criticised both Mr Cameron and Mr Miliband, writing on Twitter: "In 2010, leaders fought to prove they were the greenest. Three years on, they're desperately blaming their own policies on the other. Muppets." </body>

      <title>Meteorite may solve Martian mystery</title>
      <description>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say.</description>

      <body>A meteorite reveals clues to how Mars lost its thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere and became a cold, rocky desert, researchers say. They say the Lafayette meteorite shows signs of carbonation - where minerals absorb CO2 in a reaction with water. Mars lost its protective blanket about 4 billion years ago, perhaps because of the loss of its magnetic field, space impacts, or chemical processes. Carbonation may be the key factor, they write in Nature Communications. The process occurs naturally on Earth - and has been proposed as a technique for mitigating climate change, by capturing CO2 from the atmosphere. The 4.5cm Lafayette meteorite was discovered in Indiana, US in 1931, having plummeted to Earth about 3,000 years ago. It formed in the Red Planet's crust about 1.3 billion years ago, and was ejected from the surface by a massive impact. A team from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre (SUERC) performed microscopic analysis on a section of the rock - borrowed from the Natural History Museum in London. They found that silicate minerals, such as olivine and feldspar, had interacted with CO2-rich liquid water to form siderite crystals. The team says their discovery suggests liquid water was present on Mars more recently than some had thought. They also say it represents the first direct evidence for carbonation on the Red Planet - and ties in with the discovery of carbonates by Nasa's Curiosity Mars rover. "Carbonation could be the main force that turned Mars to stone," said lead author Dr Tim Tomkinson, of SUERC. "We can't say for certain it's the dominant cause - the loss of Mars' magnetic field may also have led to the stripping of its atmosphere by the solar wind. And CO2 is also frozen in the poles of Mars. "But carbonates do seem to be very abundant on the Martian surface." The loss of its carbon dioxide cloak is likely to have caused Mars to cool. So understanding how the CO2 was removed "could provide vital clues to how we can limit the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere and so reduce climate change" said Dr Tomkinson. Mineral carbonation is widespread on Earth. For example, in Oman's Samail mountains, weathering of peridotite rocks has been estimated to bind more than 10,000 tons of CO2 per year. Speeding up this natural process - by fracking rocks and pumping in purified CO2 - has been proposed as a technique for carbon capture and storage. "From our analysis of the meteorite, it seems that carbonation occurs in certain orientations - we see amazing saw-tooth edges, all lining up," Dr Tomkinson told BBC News. "It could be for example that if you wanted to frack rocks and introduce CO2 you should do it from a certain angle." Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at the Natural History Museum, said: "These findings show just how valuable meteorites from collections like those we have here really are. "There is so much important and useful scientific information locked away in these rare rocks. "Our study shows that as we learn more about our planetary next door neighbour, we are seeing more and more similarities with geological processes on Earth." </body>

      <title>First venomous crustacean found</title>
      <description>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves.</description>

      <body>Experts have found the first venomous crustacean - a centipede-like creature that lives in underwater caves. The blind "remipede" liquefies its prey with a compound similar to that found in a rattlesnake's fangs. It lives in underwater caves of the Caribbean, Canary Islands and Western Australia, feeding on other crustaceans. The venom contains a complex cocktail of toxins, including enzymes and a paralysing agent. The findings are detailed in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution. The remipede (Speleonectes tulumensis) breaks down body tissues with its venom and then sucks out a liquid meal from its prey's exoskeleton. Co-author Dr Ronald Jenner, a zoologist at London's Natural History Museum said: "The unique insights from this study really help improve our understanding of the evolution of animal venoms. "The spider-like feeding technique of the remipede is unique among crustaceans. This venom is clearly a great adaptation for these blind cave-dwellers that live in nutrient-poor underwater caves." Crustaceans are a large group of the wider category of animals known as arthropods. They include shrimp, krill, lobsters and crabs. Most are aquatic, but a few - such as woodlice - live on land. Dr Bjoern von Reumont, also from the Natural History Museum commented: "This is the first time we have seen venom being used in crustaceans and the study adds a new major animal group to the roster of known venomous animals. "Venoms are especially common in three of the four major groups of arthropods, such as insects. Crustaceans, however, are a glaring exception to the rule. "While they can be as varied as tiny waterfleas, krill, crabs and barnacles, not one of the approximately 70,000 described species of crustaceans was known, until now, to be venomous." </body>

Of these, 12 could be habitable - orbiting at a distance where it is neither "too hot" nor "too cold" for water to be liquid on the surface. The planets are given away by tiny dips in light as they pass in front of their stars or through gravitational "tugs" on the star from an orbiting world. These new worlds are listed in the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The tally now stands at 1,010 new exoplanets, bolstered by 11 new finds from the UK's Wide Angle Search for Planets (Wasp). Abel Mendez of the Planetary Habitability Laboratory at the University of Puerto Rico, said that although the number has rapidly increased in recent years, due to a lack of funding this figure is much lower than it could be. "We have more techniques and proven technology to detect more exoplanets, but the limit has been telescopes, especially space telescopes. "If we had more funding there would be more telescopes and that count would be much larger by now." The Kepler space telescope, which spotted many of these worlds in recent years, broke down earlier this year. Scientists still have to trawl through more than 3,500 other candidates from this mission so the number could rapidly increase. In January 2013, astronomers used Kepler's data to estimate that there could be at least 17 billion Earth-sized exoplanets in the Milky Way galaxy. They said that one in six stars could host an Earth-sized planet in close orbit. The number of confirmed planets frequently increases because as scientists analyse the data they are able publish their results online immediately. But as the finds are not yet peer reviewed, the total figure remains subject to change. "Each night we get a list of astronomy papers where there might be an exoplanet announcement. When we get that we have to review it," explained Prof Mendez. This exoplanet catalogue is organised by Jean Schneider, an astronomer at the Paris Observatory. For the past 18 years he has catalogued new exoplanets on the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. Others in the field, like Prof Mendez, are then able to review and comment on the findings, which makes it "more dynamic" he explained. "That's why the other catalogues just lag behind. The review is reliable as it's exactly the same as what the journals do." Prof Mendez told BBC News. Nasa will only accept those announced in an academic journal, so it updates its list far less frequently. Their tally currently stands at 919 confirmed worlds. Jean Schneider said it was also important to note that there was "no consensus for the definition of a planet" and that past experience had shown that a few objects declared as planets were actually artefacts or low-mass stars. "Some objects, like some Kepler planets, are declared 'confirmed planets' but have not been published in [referenced] articles. It does not mean that they will not be published later on, but it introduces another fuzziness in the tally," he added. Even if there was a generally adopted definition, Mr Schneider said that for some objects "there is a large uncertainty on parameters, so that the planetary nature of the object is uncertain". For Prof Mendez reaching 1,000 marks an important milestone in the quest to understand the history of the evolution of the cosmos. "I don't just want to know where the exoplanets are, I want to understand the stars, because they are the hosts for the planets. I want to understand the whole galaxy and the distribution of the stars because everything is connected," he explained. For him, the most exciting discoveries are Earth-like planets which could be habitable. "We want to know how unique our planet is, that's a big question and we are now closer than ever," he added. For Mr Schneider the most interesting is the candidate exoplanet around Alpha Centauri, as it is circling a star only four light-years away. This planet likely has the same mass as Earth but is outside the "habitable zone" as it circles its star far closer than Mercury orbits our Sun. </body>

      <title>UN climate chief's tears over future</title>
      <description>A passionate concern over the world that children will inherit sees the head of the UN's climate body break down in tears.</description>

      <body>The head of the UN body tasked with delivering a global climate treaty broke down in tears at a meeting in London as she spoke about the impact of global warming on coming generations. Christiana Figueres told the BBC that the lack of an agreement was "condemning future generations before they are even born". Ms Figueres said this was "completely unfair and immoral". Despite the slow pace of negotiations, she said a deal can be done by 2015. Costa Rica-born Christiana Figueres has been the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for the last three years. Taking over after the failure of the talks process in Copenhagen in 2009, Ms Figueres has carefully steered the parties forward. Delegates agreed in Durban in 2011 that a new global deal must be signed by 2015 and come into force from 2020. But Ms Figueres' passionate approach to progress has been tested by the slow, tortuous UN process, where consensus is the only way forward. "I am always frustrated by the pace of the negotiations, I was born impatient. We are moving way, way too slowly, but we are moving in the right direction and that's what gives me courage and hope," she said. Speaking to the BBC on the sidelines of a climate conference at Chatham House in London, Ms Figueres became tearful when she reflected on the impact that climate change might have on coming generations. "I'm committed to climate change because of future generations, it is not about us, right? We're out of here," she said. "I just feel that it is so completely unfair and immoral what we are doing to future generations, we are condemning them before they are even born." "We have a choice about it, that's the point, we have a choice. If it were inevitable then so be it, but we have a choice to change the future we are going to give our children." She said that she was hopeful an agreement could be signed in Paris in 2015 but if that was going to happen, then significant progress had to be made in the next 12 months. There would need to be the draft text of an agreement when the parties meet in Peru in 2014. She said she was determined to avoid the mistakes that were made in the run up to Copenhagen in 2009, when expectations of a far reaching global compact faltered. "We are not going to have another Copenhagen - the leaders of the world are not just being brought in at the last minute, to face 300 pages of text that is completely impossible to digest. Next year would see a special climate summit of world leaders called by UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon. Ms Figueres is hopeful that this will clear the road ahead of the Paris meeting in 2015. "It is not going to be in Paris, going into all the technical details of how to build the agreement which is what we had in Copenhagen. The structure and logic of an agreement need to be in place. "This is way too complex and way too challenging to wait until the last minute in 2015." This year's Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC will take place next month in Poland. Some environmental campaigners are concerned that because of the country's heavy dependence on coal, it is less committed to strong action on climate change. Critics took issue with comments on an official website for the conference that suggested there were many positives to the unprecedented melting of Arctic ice, including the opportunity to chase "pirates, terrorists and ecologists". But Ms Figueres dismissed concerns about the meeting. "They have shown themselves to be very committed to this process, the COP president (Polish environment minister Marcin Korolec) has put in an extraordinary amount of time into learning and making himself familiar with the endless intricacies of this issue," she said.

      <title>Badger group disruption aids TB flow</title>

      <body>Badgers with TB spread the infection more easily to other badgers and to cattle when social groups are disturbed, a new study confirms. Vaccination has the potential to reduce the spread of infection without disturbing local populations, scientists report in Current Biology. The findings help explain why culling badgers can cause TB infection in cattle to rise, as infected badgers roam into new territory, they say. Pilot culls are underway in England. Badgers are being culled in west Somerset; with a decision due shortly on whether to extend a pilot cull in west Gloucestershire. In the study, researchers at the University of Exeter and the National Wildlife Management Centre at Woodchester Park, Gloucestershire, fitted 51 badgers in eight different social groups with electronic collars. They monitored the range of the wild badgers and their social interactions over the course of a year. The researchers were able to build a detailed picture of the social network of a wild population of badgers for the first time. We think of badgers as living in tight knit social groups and "sleeping in a big heap underground", but there is more complexity to it, said Prof Robbie McDonald of the University of Exeter, who led the study. "What our study shows is that social structure is very important for the transmission of infection in wild badgers," he told BBC News. "It also suggests that social stability is a good way of mitigating disease spread. So if you can intervene in a system and maintain social stability that's likely to be the best of both worlds." Vaccination does not disrupt social structure, he said, suggesting the social network in badgers - where relatively few individuals might be responsible for disease spread - lends itself to vaccination and could lead quite rapidly to herd immunity. "If you are trying to control disease, it may be advantageous not to disrupt social structure and so you could disrupt flow through those sorts of individuals by using vaccination," Prof McDonald added. "But of course vaccination doesn't do any good to an animal that's already infected." A 9-year trial found that culling badgers could reduce infection in cattle by 12-16% (after four years of culling and five years of follow-up). But if too few badgers are killed over too long a time period, TB infections in cattle can rise as badgers roam further afield to establish new social groups. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the Institute of Zoology, London, said the study provided clarity about how badgers' social behaviour helps to constrain the spread of TB. "Genetic studies in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial found that culling increased badgers' movements, with especially marked increases for infected badgers," she said. "This new study helps to understand how such behavioural changes could prompt the major increases in disease prevalence which we saw as a result of culling. "The authors are right to highlight that their work shows how the benefits of badger vaccination are likely to be enhanced by badgers' social behaviour, because badger social networks are small and local, so vaccinating small numbers of badgers could still have benefits at a local scale. In contrast, culling disrupts badger social behaviour and spreads disease across the landscape." The Welsh government has chosen to vaccinate badgers in an effort to control TB in cattle, while the government policy in England is to cull badgers in high TB areas. Around 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012 at a cost of Â£100m to taxpayers. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to fight bovine TB, but animal welfare and wildlife groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. </body>

      <title>Dung beetle has galloping gait</title>
      <description>Three species of desert dung beetle move with a newly discovered "galloping gait", rather than walking like other insects, scientists say.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insect species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. The researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs." The beetles appeared simply to "drag" their back legs, they added. Dr Jochen Smolka, from the University of Lund in Sweden, who carried out the research in South Africa, was studying wingless desert dung beetles in order to find out how they navigated to their burrows. "We noticed that [one species we were looking at] was kind of bobbing along in a peculiar manner," he told BBC News. "At first we thought that maybe there was something wrong with it - that maybe it had some damage to its hind legs. "And then we noticed that all of the beetles of that species move like that most of the time." The researchers used high-speed camera to film the beetles' motion in detail. They then carried out tests in the lab, tracing the exact movement of the insects' legs as they walked across sandpaper. If the group of species the team was studying, known as Pachysoma, they found three species to have this same unusual gait. Dr Bill Sellers, who studies biomechanics at the University of Manchester, described the findings as "very peculiar". He explained that almost all of about one million insect species that have been described to science walk with the classic tripod gait. "They form a triangle with their legs," he explained. "So they have the left-front, right-middle and left-back legs on down at once, and then the opposite ones." "It's a very easy gait to control, and we know it's quite efficient." "So it's difficult to see why these beetles do what they do - it's a real puzzle." Dr Smolka and his colleagues carried out miniature time trials in their lab to see if this beetle was able to move any faster than beetles that walked normally. "But it turned out that the normally walking insects were up to 50% faster," he said. "What we're going to look at in the future is if it has something to do with their navigation." Their latest studies have suggested that the galloping beetles are able to stabilise their vision better when they are on slippery surfaces. "So it could be that if you're moving really fast [in a tripod gait], your head just moves from side to side so much that vision could be blurred," Dr Smolka explained. "Whereas in the galloping beetles, vision is always stabilised towards the front." </body>

      <title>UK set to guarantee energy projects</title>
      <description>A string of renewable energy projects are earmarked for possible government backing in an effort to speed up infrastructure schemes.</description>

      <body>A string of renewable energy projects have been earmarked for possible government backing. The private schemes, including a Forth Estuary wind farm and a biomass plant in Bristol are in line for up to Â£33bn in government guarantees. The Treasury has agreed to step in and underwrite part of the building costs if they cannot get funding elsewhere. Ministers said it would boost growth and jobs, but Labour said their record on infrastructure was "appalling". The Treasury has announced details of 13 energy, transport and education schemes that could get government backing if they do not attract financial backing by other means. The Â£40bn UK Guarantee Scheme, launched by Chancellor George Osborne last year, is part of ministers' efforts to encourage private sector investment and to boost spending seen as vital to the economy's long-term development. The new projects eligible for potential support are: Should the projects fail to attract commercial funding, the government has agreed to step in to underwrite part or all of the capital spending - charging the contractors a fee for doing so. The government has previously announced that it is prepared to guarantee the proposed Â£16bn nuclear power station at Hinkley Point in Somerset, due to be built by French firm EDF, with support from Chinese investors. The extension of the Northern Line Tube network in London and the Mersey Gateway bridge have also been offered guarantees, in principle, as have 24 other projects whose details have not been released for commercial reasons. Guarantees are not awarded until detailed feasibility and due diligence studies have been completed and contractors are ready to approach financial markets for funding. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said the government was the first ever to use the strength of its balance sheet to facilitate infrastructure projects. He defended the number of projects that had been backed so far, saying the mere offer of a guarantee had helped some projects to get alternative sources of funding. "The offer of a guarantee is helping to get projects going," he told the BBC News Channel. "There is a lot of infrastructure happening in this country because of this programme." In 2010, the government pledged to spend Â£200bn on major infrastructure projects by 2015, with an emphasis on delivering key projects on time and on budget. It has also announced additional spending after 2015. The Institute of Civil Engineers welcomed Tuesday's announcement and said the guarantee scheme had enabled "viable projects to secure finance in difficult market conditions". "It is an excellent example of government making creative use of its resources to get projects moving," said the organisation's director general Nick Baveystock. But Labour said the government had wasted the past three years. The opposition said only one project - the Â£700m partial conversion of the Drax power plant in North Yorkshire from coal to biomass - had actually taken advantage of the UK Guarantee scheme to date while, in total, work had only begun on one in five of infrastructure projects. "There's lots more that could be done but they just don't seem to have their heart in it," said shadow Treasury minister Chris Leslie. "The energy isn't there and there's a question of competence now about whether they can deliver on some of these infrastructure promises that they're making." Labour has called for an independent commission to be set up to end what it says are "decades of drift and delay" on major infrastructure decisions. Business groups have also warned about the slow pace of infrastructure spending, saying it holds the key to a sustainable long-term recovery. "Despite the scale of the UK Guarantee Scheme, only around a third of firms are aware of it, so this announcement will help raise awareness to other projects struggling to find finance," said the CBI's Rhian Kelly. "The government now needs to push more of these pre-qualification projects through the approval stage so that they can get off the drawing board." </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <title>Baldness cure a 'step closer'</title>
      <description>Scientists have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they have moved a step closer to banishing bald spots and reversing receding hairlines after human hair was grown in the laboratory. A joint UK and US team was able to create new hairs from tissue samples. Far more research is needed, but the group said its technique had the "potential to transform" the treatment of hair loss. The study results were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. There are baldness therapies including drugs to slow the loss of hairs, and transplants, which move hair from the back of the head to cover bald spots. The scientists at the University of Durham, in the UK, and Columbia University Medical Centre, in the US, were trying to actually grow new hairs. Their plan was to start with material taken from the base of a hair and use it to grow many new hairs. But human hair has been tricky to grow despite successes in animal studies. Whenever human tissue was taken from the dermal papillae, the cells which form the base of each hair follicle, the cells would transform into skin instead of growing new hairs. However, the group found that by clumping the cells together in "3D spheroids" they would keep their hairy identity. Tissue was taken from seven people and grown in 3D spheroids. These were then transplanted into human skin which had been grafted on to the backs of mice. After six weeks, new hair follicles formed in five out of the seven cases and some new tiny hairs began to form. Prof Colin Jahoda, from Durham University, told the BBC a cure for baldness was possible but it was too soon for men to be hanging up the toupee. "It's closer, but it's still some way away because in terms of what people want cosmetically they're looking for re-growth of hair that's the same shape, the same size, as long as before, the same angle. Some of these are almost engineering solutions. "Yeah I think it [baldness] will eventually be treatable, absolutely." He added: "It's hard to say exactly how long that would take, but the fact that we've done it now should reawaken interest." Any future therapy would involve transplanting cells which have been grown in the laboratory so safety is a concern. There would be a risk of infection and the cells could become abnormal, or even cancerous, while being grown. Baldness cures may not be the first application of the research. Prof Jahoda believes the findings will be used to improve the quality of skin grafts used after severe burns. Prof Angela Christiano, from Columbia University, said: "This approach has the potential to transform the medical treatment of hair loss. "Current hair-loss medications tend to slow the loss of hair follicles or potentially stimulate the growth of existing hairs, but they do not create new hair follicles. "Our method, in contrast, has the potential to actually grow new follicles using a patient's own cells." </body>

      <body>The US space agency has said it will allow Chinese scientists to attend an astronomy conference in California next month, reversing an earlier ban. Nasa put the earlier ban down to a misinterpretation of its policy on foreign nationals. Chinese officials had called the rejection of Chinese scientists' applications a form of discrimination. The event for scientists who research planets beyond the solar system will be held at Ames Research Center. The bar on Chinese scientists, revealed earlier this month, was prompted by new counter-espionage legislation restricting foreign nationals' access to Nasa facilities, Nasa spokesman Allard Beutel told the BBC. The conference will be attended by US and international researchers who work on Nasa's Kepler space telescope programme. The agency faced criticism from Chinese officials and US scientists who claimed Chinese students and researchers in their labs were being subjected to discrimination. In recent weeks, a growing number of US scientists decided to boycott the meeting in protest, with senior researchers withdrawing individually or pulling out their entire research groups. "The initial decision was based on a misinterpretation of the agency's policy regarding foreign nationals," Mr Beutel said. "We were able to clarify that interpretation and correct the decision, but it didn't happen until the federal government reopened last Thursday." Earlier this month the US government partially shut down operations for 16 days, putting hundreds of thousands of federal employees on leave. The counter-espionage legislation passed in March was part of a broad and aggressive move initiated by Congressman Frank Wolf, Republican chairman of the House of Representatives subcommittee that has jurisdiction over Nasa's budget. Mr Wolf later called Nasa's reading of the legislation "inaccurate" and sought to clarify the original intent of the law. "The congressional provision - which has been in place since early 2011 - primarily restricts bilateral, not multilateral, meetings and activities with the Communist Chinese government or Chinese-owned companies," Mr Wolf wrote in an 8 October letter to Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden. "It places no restrictions on activities involving individual Chinese nationals unless those nationals are acting as official representatives of the Chinese government," he wrote. </body>

      <title>UK first in heart failure operation</title>
      <description>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time.</description>

      <body>A pioneering operation to improve the function of failing hearts while they are still beating has taken place in the UK for the first time. Patients with heart failure struggle to pump blood around the body and mild exercise can leave them breathless. Surgeons used a form of "cardiac sewing" to remove scar tissue and reduce the size of the heart so it pumps more efficiently. The operation took place at King's College Hospital in London. One common cause of heart failure is when the arteries which nourish the organ become blocked, leading to a heart attack. Heart muscle dies and is replaced by hard scar tissue which does not beat. Over time, the scar tissue can stretch so chambers of the heart become larger, meaning the organ has more blood to force out with each heartbeat. The overall effect is a weaker heart, less able to do its job, transforming simple day-to-day tasks like climbing stairs into extreme exertions. In the operation, surgeons used a wire with anchors at both ends to pierce two sections of heart muscle. When the wire was tightened, the walls of the heart were "remodelled". The scar tissue was effectively removed and the volume of one of the chambers of the heart was reduced by a quarter. Sevket Gocer, 58 and from Bromley in south-east London, was the first patient to be treated in the UK. His heart function is said to have "improved significantly" after the operation. A similar procedure used to be performed by opening up the chest and stopping the heart, but it was a very risky operation and fell out of medical practice. Surgeons hope the less invasive operation, which can be performed while the heart is still pumping, will be a better option for patients. Mr Olaf Wendler, a professor of cardiac surgery at King's College Hospital, told the BBC: "In the technique we have now used for the first time in the UK, one does not need to stop the heart, one does not even necessarily need to place the patient on a heart-lung machine. "It's a less traumatic and less invasive type of procedure." He said the operation was being tested in a trial at hospitals across Europe and that the procedure could make a difference to patients' lives. He said: "[If successful] it's bringing them on to an exercise level where they're able to look after themselves properly including going to do the shopping and having a social life." Prof Jeremy Pearson, associate medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: "The results of this trial will determine if this experimental procedure is safe. "If the trial is successful, there will be further use of the technology as surgeons gain expertise in the technique. As more people are treated with this procedure, it will become fully clear whether it will have a real benefit for patients." </body>

The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the University of Southampton and archaeology member of the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio outbreak fears</title>
      <description>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return in war-torn Syria.</description>

      <body>Experts are concerned that polio may have made a return to war-torn Syria. The World Health Organization says it has received reports of the first suspected outbreak in the country in 14 years. Syrian's Ministry of Public Health is launching an urgent response, but experts fear the disease will be hard to control amid civil unrest. Immunisation is almost impossible to carry out in regions under intense shellfire. As a result, vaccination rates have been waning - from 95% in 2010 to an estimated 45% in 2013. At least a third of the country's public hospitals are out of service, and in some areas, up to 70% of the health workforce has fled. Outbreak risks have also increased due to overcrowding, poor sanitation and deterioration in water supply. More than four million Syrians who have relocated to less volatile areas of the country are mostly living in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO says it is already seeing increased cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A in Syria. Dr Jaouad Mahjour, director of the department for communicable diseases at WHO's regional office for the Eastern Mediterranean, said: "Given the scale of population movement both inside Syria and across borders, together with deteriorating environmental health conditions, outbreaks are inevitable." The cluster of suspected polio cases was detected in early October 2013 in Deir al-Zour province. Initial results from a laboratory in Damascus indicate that at least two of the cases could indeed be polio. A surveillance alert has been issued for the region to actively search for additional potential cases. Supplementary immunisation activities in neighbouring countries are currently being planned. WHO's International Travel and Health recommends that all travellers to and from polio-infected areas be fully vaccinated against polio. Most people infected with the poliovirus have no signs of illness and are never aware they have been infected. These symptomless people carry the virus in their intestines and can "silently" spread the infection to thousands of others before the first case of polio paralysis emerges. Polio is spread by eating food or drink contaminated with faeces or, more rarely, directly from person-to-person via saliva. </body>

      <title>Worldwide ban on bird pollutant</title>
      <description>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year can no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed.</description>

      <body>A pollutant that killed thousands of birds off the coast of Britain earlier this year will no longer be dumped at sea after a worldwide ban was agreed. More than 4,000 birds were killed or injured by the chemical polyisobutene (PIB) between Cornwall and Sussex, and on the Channel Islands. The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has reclassified PIBs from 2014. It means ships will only be able to wash their tanks and dispose of all PIB residues while in port. Until now it has been legal for discharges to be made when vessels wash out their tanks, as long as they are further than 12 nautical miles from the nearest point of land. The ban had been recommended by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), on behalf of the government, and was welcomed by the RSPB, RSPCA and other wildlife charities. The decision was taken by the IMO at a meeting in London on Monday. "There was only one entry for PIBs before," said the IMO's Natasha Brown. "We are keeping the current category but will create a new entry for the high viscosity PIB, which is the problem chemical if you like, in terms of these discharges." The substance - a lubricant used to improve the engine performance of ships - was found on seabirds, mainly guillemots, in two separate instances between January and May. In the sea, high viscosity PIB becomes "glue-like", covering birds and restricting their movements and ability to feed, causing them to eventually die from hypothermia or starvation. In August, the MCA said it had been unable to trace the vessel the contamination spill had come from and closed its investigation. Adam Grogan, RSPCA senior wildlife scientist, said: "Our staff worked around the clock washing and treating these poor birds in January and April and it was heartbreaking seeing the pitiful state they were in. "Hopefully this will help stop incidents like these happening again, and save wildlife from suffering and dying like this in the future." Alec Taylor, from RSPB, said wildlife charities worked hard for the ban, with support from several south coast MPs. "But the huge support we received from members of the public, many of whom experienced the effects of this pollution first hand as they walked the beaches, was perhaps the clinching factor in achieving such a quick decision to prevent discharges of harmful PIBs," he added. The IMO is the United Nations agency responsible for the safety and security of shipping and the prevention of marine pollution by ships. It consists of 170 member states, of which the UK is one. The organisation confirmed a number of other European countries had also been investigating the discharge of "high viscosity products" by chemical tankers, including PIBs. </body>

      <body>Social media has lit up with earthquake rumours after a giant oarfish washed up on a California beach - the second such discovery in several days. The 4.3m (14ft) dead snake-like fish was found in the city of Oceanside - five days after another and larger specimen (5.5m) had been found. Reports on social media recall an ancient Japanese myth linking extremely rare oarfish sightings to tremors. But scientists remain sceptical of any link to increased tectonic activity. They remain puzzled, however, by the two discoveries of this rare deepwater fish near the beach. The larger specimen, found on Santa Catalina island, has now been dissected and it appears well-fed, healthy and with little sign of disease. "It looks good enough to eat - if you have a 13ft pan," biologist Ruff Zetter said. Tests are also being done for radiation, following Japan's Fukushima nuclear leak on the other side of the Pacific. But it is also a rare chance to gather information about a little-known species that hovers vertically in the ocean and grazes on passing proteins. The elusive fish - which can grow up to 15m - dives to depth of up to 1,000m and is found in all temperate to tropical waters. </body>

      <title>British forests under threat</title>
      <description>New global threats from pests and diseases could spell disaster for British forests, experts warn.</description>

      <body>A year after the first case of ash dieback in wild trees in Britain, the disease has now spread across much of England, Wales and Scotland. The public is being asked to be the "eyes and ears" of the countryside amid concern about new global threats that could spell disaster for forests. In a London park, forester Simon Levey is checking a moth trap strung high in the canopy of an oak tree. He is searching for signs of the oak processionary moth, which is present in parts of the capital and Berkshire. When the moth's caterpillars emerge from their nests, they can strip oak trees bare and harm human health. "What we're looking for in these oak trees we see around us is their nests," says Mr Levey. "They're like a grey wart on the side of a tree that can range from the size of a golf ball, if not smaller, to things that are almost a couple of foot in size." It is the moth's caterpillars - with their thousands of tiny hairs - that are the hazard. Touching the caterpillars or their nests can cause skin rashes or, in extreme cases, sore throats, breathing difficulties and eye problems. In Croydon, inspections are being carried out for the moth around a 2km zone as part of a rigorous programme of control and monitoring. Infected areas are sprayed with a bacteriological agent to destroy nests and caterpillars. The traps - which contain a sex hormone that attracts male moths - are set outside from July to September, when adult moths are in flight, to see how far they have spread. "We've actually created a ring of traps for these moths round the infected area just to see if the moths are flying beyond where we would expect them to be," says Mr Levey. Dr Nigel Straw from the Centre for Forestry and Climate Change at the Forestry Commission says monitoring is key to organising a control programme - including surveys from the ground and pheromone trapping. Any moths captured are sent to the Forestry Commission's research station in Hampshire for analysis. "We will look at how many moths have been caught and at which locations and this will tell us where we are likely to have trees with eggs which will lead to infestations next year," says Dr Straw. Officials hope the outbreak in Croydon can be contained. But they accept the battle is lost in west and south-west London - where the moth is here to stay. Britain should expect "many hundreds" more pests and pathogens to arrive in the coming years, say scientists at Exeter University. The rise in global trade means pests that damage crops such as fungi, beetle and moths are now moving into new territories faster than other wildlife, aided by climate change, they report in the journal Nature Climate Change. Hundreds of pests and pathogens have shifted their ranges towards the poles by an average of about 3km a year since 1960. Insects are moving even faster, expanding their range by tens of kilometres a year, says Dr Daniel Bebber. "We know things are spreading and part of that spread is due to climate change. It's just one more impact that climate change is having on us. Things are being introduced all the time to different places. Climate change can help things to establish." In Croydon, Simon Levey is concerned about a decline if not a "potentially catastrophic loss" of some of Britain's dominant tree species, including the oak. He says acute oak decline is present in the area, but it is difficult to identify. "There's huge pressure on resources in terms of actually getting out there and identifying them," he says, "I suspect that if things progress as they do, we might face a real problem with our oak trees - a significant change in our landscape similar to the landscape changes when Dutch elm disease had its heyday in the '70s." With only limited government resources to monitor for new pests, some of that job may fall to the public. This is not unprecedented. In the past, the citrus longhorn beetle, which can arrive on deliveries from Asia of tree and shrub plants, and goods in wooden crates and packaging, has been spotted by vigilant members of the public. In July, Martin Ward, the UK government's chief plant health officer, asked for help from the public to spot Asian longhorn and citrus longhorn beetles. "Government plant health services cannot do this work alone, and we need the public to act as our eyes and ears in gardens, parks, woodlands and workplaces to help us spot threats quickly before they become a serious problem," he said. "The public can really help us at this time of year by looking out for these two potentially serious beetle pests. They thrive in climates similar to ours, and their establishment could result in losses of trees from a wide range of species." The Woodland Trust is currently training volunteers to look out for signs of tree diseases, while a citizen science project, known as Opal (Open Air Laboratories), is harnessing people-power to build a national picture of tree health. In the long term, however, there are big questions about the future shape and role of Britain's treescape. "What protects trees in the long term is diversity both in species and genetics," says Dr Bebber. "We don't have a very diverse tree flora - both in genetics and species diversity. We lost our elms in large because they were so genetically uniform. "We can learn from the science of ecology and evolution and look at the natural world and see that diversity is the protection. We certainly don't want to see the oak disappearing, the ash disappearing - it would be a sadder Britain." </body>

      <body>The badger cull in Gloucestershire could be halted after a legal challenge from a charity which says plans to extend the culling period are illegal. An eight-week extension to the cull was requested after a failure to kill the minimum number of badgers during a six-week pilot aimed at curbing bovine TB. In a letter, the Badger Trust said it would be "unlawful" for Natural England "to grant a further licence". Defra said it could not comment on the letter for "legal reasons". It said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised the cull should be extended. Defra said culls were "important to tackle bovine TB". A Defra spokesman said: "That is why these pilot culls are so important. We have to use every tool in the box because TB is so difficult to eradicate and it is spreading rapidly." The Badger Trust said it was asking Natural England to consider their letter when looking at the application to "grant a fresh licence" to shoot badgers in Gloucestershire. The letter used quotes from original statements from ministers and officials who the trust said had talked of the cull having "a maximum period of six weeks". The trust said it believed the cull had "met its purpose in testing the 'effectiveness' and had shown it not to be effective". A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <body>A zoo's two new kittens could have a future role in a project to breed Scottish wildcats in captivity for possible release into the wild. Ness and Einich were born at the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's (RZSS) Highland Wildlife Park at Kincraig, near Aviemore. RZSS and the Aspinall Foundation are leading the plans for a conservation breeding programme. The wildlife park will be among the project's main breeding sites. RZSS said Ness and Einich may play a part in the programme, which is part of the wider Scottish Wildcat Conservation Action Plan unveiled last month and involves Scottish Natural Heritage. The cats are endangered in the wild. Breeding with feral cats, disease, habitat loss and fatal collisions with road traffic have caused a dramatic decline in their numbers. Only a few hundred pure-bred Scottish wildcats are thought to survive. Douglas Richardson, head of living collections at the Highland Wildlife Park, said the new kittens were the latest breeding success for the park. He said: "But with the wildcat action plan, the contribution that these little chaps may make in the future to their species' survival will hopefully be more impactful. "The plan is for a much more aggressively managed breeding programme, running alongside a wide range of other wildcat conservation initiatives that will eventually turn the tide for the species in Scotland." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Amazonia 'ruled' by 227 tree species</title>
      <description>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <body>Scientists have discovered that three species of dung beetle walk with a "galloping" gait not seen in any other insect. The vast majority of insects species walk with what is known as an alternating tripod gait - steadily moving forward three legs at a time. It is not clear why these flightless beetles have shifted so radically from the usual way of walking. The findings are reported in the journal Current Biology. Describing this strange gait in their paper, the researchers wrote: "Like a bounding hare, the beetles propel their body forward by synchronously stepping with both middle legs and then both front legs."

      <description>How dangerous is the false widow spider?</description>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>When an operating theatre becomes a lab</title>
      <description>Why research is key to better surgery</description>

      <body>Scientific research takes place in a lab, doesn't it? Well, not when the developments are in surgery. Then it takes place in the clinics, wards and even the operating theatre. In this week's Scrubbing Up, Prof Dion Morton, director of research at the Royal College of Surgeons, says it is crucial that patients understand how important the work is - and that they take part. When people think about clinical trials their first thought might be of laboratories where pharmaceutical companies test the safety and effectiveness of drugs and vaccines. But in surgery too, clinical trials are a vitally important way of assessing the benefits new treatments bring to patients. Research and clinical trials are a daily part of the NHS, with many studies carried out by doctors and healthcare professionals who treat patients on a daily basis. Although 98% of people in the UK will need surgery at some point in their lives, less than 5% of government funding for medical research goes on improving surgery and developing new techniques. Surgery has been referred to as the 'Cinderella' of medical research, although funding has been slowly improving in recent years. From treating acute trauma to replacing joints after chronic disease, surgery has a broad impact and still cures more cancers than any other form of treatment. It is a vital part of the health service and investment in research is crucial if we are to be at the forefront of improving patient care. This is why new surgical clinical trial centres have been set up across the country. Surgeons are currently recruiting patients to assess new surgical techniques and determine which procedures give patients the best chance of making a full recovery. Each centre will focus on many different types of surgery including transplantation, heart and orthopaedic. Trials are challenging to design and it can be difficult to recruit patients, but with careful planning and good communication they are made possible. I am working on an international study which aims to find out at what point patients with late stage bowel cancer should be given chemotherapy. Bowel cancer is the fourth most common cancer in the UK and patients currently have to have surgery first to remove the cancer and then have chemotherapy. However, when the disease is advanced, all too often the cancer returns in the months or years that follow. This trial will look at whether patients who are given some chemotherapy prior to surgery are less likely to see their cancer return in the two years after treatment. In Bristol, colleagues are running a trial to compare the effectiveness of two common operations to treat severe obesity - gastric band and gastric bypass. During the course of the trial doctors will study over 700 patients, of which half will have been fitted with a gastric band and half will have had a bypass. Over three years they will compare how much weight patients' lose, whether they experience any complications following surgery and to what extent their quality of life improves following the operation. Obesity is a rapidly increasing global health problem which costs the NHS billions of pounds. Surgery is both a clinically-effective and cost-effective way of treating this disease and so the results of this trial will help the NHS decide which of these two treatments they should offer to patients. Surgical research has the potential to make real improvements in the way we care and treat patients. Patient safety and innovation go hand in hand as it is the evidence gained from these trials that will ultimately lead to reduced patient mortality and sickness. Despite limited investment, surgeons are striving to develop the evidence for new techniques and procedures that can change the face of hospital care. Raising standards, delivering new surgical treatments to patients and delivering them safely nationwide is central to a high quality health service. </body>

      <body>The Siberian tiger: majestic, enigmatic - the classic big cat precariously balanced on the edge of extinction. Threatened by deforestation and poaching to supply the black market trade in tiger body parts, it is one of the most endangered cats on the planet. But over the past decade or so, a new threat has emerged - a silent, insidious one - canine distemper virus. Worldwide there are an estimated 400-500 Siberian or Amur tigers. Exact numbers are hard to determine because this is a reclusive animal that is rarely observed. Yet, at the turn of the century, some of these otherwise withdrawn animals were seen wandering onto roads and into villages in the Russian Far East. They were fearless and docile, confused and dazed; the antithesis of their usual ferocious and wary demeanour. Over the next few years evidence mounted that this, the largest living felid, was suffering from an infectious agent and the indications - the nature of the illness, historical understanding of wild cat infections and the diagnosis, in a single wild tiger, of a virus belonging to the morbillivirus genus - provided a likely culprit. A study published in the journal mBio, confirmed these suspicions. Genetic analysis of several dead tiger samples showed that canine distemper virus was the cause. Canine distemper virus (CDV), a relative of the human measles virus, was first described in dogs and infection causes fatal pneumonia and encephalitis (inflammation of the brain). But this virus is incredibly promiscuous and can infect jump into a variety of different animals - usually with catastrophic effects. Two suspected CDV outbreaks, the first in 1988 and a second in 2000, killed thousands of Baikal then Caspian seals. The virus has also ripped through Africa, with fatal outbreaks in silver-backed jackals and bat-eared foxes and catastrophic die-offs in wild dog populations that continue to this day. For years, cats were thought resistant to CDV. Yes, domestic cats could be infected in the laboratory, but this was inefficient and the virus was unable to pass from one animal to another. A massive demise in 1994 of African lions living in the Serengeti national park in Tanzania showed that this was fallacy. This population of closely monitored lions succumbed to CDV. Whilst only 34 lion deaths were documented during the outbreak, this was only the tip of the iceberg. Before CDV struck, the lion population numbered 3,000, but afterwards this had fallen by a third. In the same outbreak, countless hyenas, bat-eared foxes and leopards also perished. Add to this the recent report of infection of large numbers of South American jaguar and it is evident that this virus has little, if any respect for the so-called species barrier - the unique inherent host factors and properties that prevent viruses from jumping from one species to another. In an intriguing turn of events, CDV was also starting to spark fatal outbreaks in various primates. So what should we make of the emergence of CDV infection in primates. Is this an indication of the potential for a more compelling species jump? Could CDV do the unthinkable and infect humans? The simple answer is a resounding yes. At least, in theory it is. To replicate, a virus has to get into a host cell. It does this through interactions between proteins on its surface with proteins - receptors - on the surface of the cell. These receptors act as gateways into the cell and if the virus protein fits then infection takes place. Different animals possess slightly different versions of these receptors on their cells so the virus proteins also have to change to be able to unlock them. A single mutation in one of surface proteins in CDV present in primates is all it takes for the virus to successfully use the human receptor. This is a tiny species barrier. But before banishing the pet dog to a high containment kennel then donning personal protective clothing before you go near, there's a key part of the story we need to consider - one that's probably been protecting us for all of these years. When you're exposed to a virus your body recognises it as foreign and your blood cells generate antibodies which bind to the virus surface proteins and protect us from infection. It's the basis for vaccination. Fortunately, the surface protein of the measles virus is so similar to CDV that antibodies generated by the measles vaccine also protect against CD; and other morbilliviruses too. But, if we ever eradicate measles and stop vaccination, maybe then we will be susceptible to CDV. But what of the Amur tiger - will CDV ensure its ultimate demise? As Dr Denise McAloose, lead author on the mBio paper, explained: "When you're talking about four to five hundred animals and your losing reproductive females and their offspring, the overall impact on populations is huge. "Some of the earlier modelling work, if it were to pan out, does suggest that this is a significant disease even at the levels of disease we are detecting now, which is probably just the tip of the iceberg." A bleak outlook that is shared by a University of Nottingham colleague, veterinary virologist Dr Rachael Tarlinton: "Because they are such tiny populations even relatively small mortality events can seriously harm their genetic diversity and this might just be enough to push them over the edge." Hopefully it's not too late. We know that CDV vaccines work and a targeted vaccination programme might just pull Amur tigers back from the brink. Current CDV vaccines have to be injected - no trivial task when the animal you want to protect is so difficult to track down and so dangerous to handle. But not all vaccines need to be injected - some very effective vaccines have been developed for oral delivery and these have been pivotal in our fight against rabies. In the late 1970s, Switzerland pioneered the widespread deployment of enticing baits laced with rabies vaccine that would be eaten by rabies-susceptible wild animals, thereby protecting them. So successful was this approach that following a similar campaign that spanned more than two decades, Germany was declared rabies-free. Whilst development of an oral vaccine is scientifically feasible, it is unlikely ever to become a reality. As Dr Tarlinton explains: "It was worth developing the oral bait vaccines for rabies because of the human zoonosis risk, but something for a purely veterinary disorder, particularly one that infects wildlife rather than livestock? It's difficult to justify the economics of doing it, even if we should." Even though vaccinating tigers is unfeasible there is an alternative: identify the reservoir and remove the virus at source through vaccination campaigns. This has proven very effective in protecting CDV-threatened lion populations in Africa. But do we know what the reservoir is? Domestic dogs have been implicated in all epidemics involving wildlife but, because the virus can infect other animals, you have to be sure. And this is what Dr McAloose and her colleagues have turned their attention to. "We have to understand if there's a reservoir. "We're trying to identify how the virus is cycling through the system to understand what the carriers are, and only with these results would we be able to make the appropriate recommendations." For the sake of the Amur tigers, I wish them well in their quest. </body>

      <description>India's mission to Mars set to stoke fires of new Asian space race</description>

      <body>The forthcoming launch of a spacecraft to Mars by India is likely to stoke the fires of a burgeoning Asian space race. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is making its final preparations to send an orbiter to the Red Planet. The principal aim is to test out India's space technology to see if this emerging space-faring nation is capable of interplanetary missions. The spacecraft will also collect scientific information about the planet's atmosphere and surface. The Mangalyaan probe was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to delay the launch by a week. The unmanned mission has a launch window lasting until 19 November. If the mission succeeds, ISRO will become only the fourth space agency, after those in the US, Europe and Russia to have successfully sent a spacecraft to Mars. According to Pallava Bagla, science editor of New Delhi television news and author of a book about India's space efforts, Destination Moon, the country's public are especially excited about the possibility of beating China to the Red Planet. "If India does beat China to Mars you can imagine the national pride," he told BBC News. The mission was announced in August last year by India's Prime Minister Manmohan Singh during his independence day speech, delivered from the ramparts of one of New Delhi's most iconic buildings - the Red Fort. "Anything said from the ramparts of the Red Fort is always replete with national pride and national pride is written very largely and boldly on this mission," according to Mr Bagla. In 2011, a Chinese attempt to send a spacecraft named Yinghou-1 to Mars was aborted because of a technical problem. The Indian space agency then fast-tracked its Mars mission, called Mangalyaan, readying it in just 15 months. India has had a space programme for more than 30 years. Until recently, its priority has been to develop technologies that would directly help its poor population, such as improving its telecommunications infrastructure and environmental monitoring with satellites. But in 2008, ISRO translated its formidable capability to build and launch satellites toward exploration and send a probe to the Moon, Chandrayaan-1. The lunar mission cost more than Â£55m. Now the government has spent a further Â£60m to go to Mars. Some have questioned the government's shift away from building infrastructure towards exploration, and wonder whether the money could have been better spent. It is a point that draws this robust response from Mr Bagla: "You can't bring the 400 million people who live in poverty in India out of poverty with this Â£60 million," he says. The shift towards exploration is also a hard-headed one by officials in the hope that it will have clear economic benefits, according to Prof Andrew Coates, who rejoices in the impressive title of "Head of the Solar System" at the Mullard Space Sciences Laboratory in Surrey, part of University College London. "The exploration programme gives them something very high to aim for. If they can show the world they have what it takes to send spacecraft to other planets they can begin to sell launches and space on its launch vehicles to scientific organisations. It also brings India to the table of international space science exploration," Prof Coates explained. Developing satellites and developing launchers is now big business. If India, or for that matter China, ease up on their investments in space exploration there is a risk that they could lose out, not least on the vital expertise that this cutting edge endeavour brings to their respective countries. Sandeep Chachra, executive director of the poverty eradication charity Action Aid in India believes that investment in space exploration could potentially benefit the country's poorest. "Investing in new technology, including space technology is an important part of the aspirations for an economy such as India. Developing a sophisticated technological base in a country with this level of poverty is not a simplistic contradiction " he told BBC News. "What is important is to harness the advances that science and technology bring for the greater good and to use those advances to overcome ingrained poverty and build hope for future generations". China though remains the greater power in space. The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has a well developed astronaut programme and an orbiting laboratory called Tiangong-1. The CNSA is planning to send its Chang'e-3 spacecraft and accompanying rover to the Moon in December. The mission is part of an ambitious plan to send more robotic probes to the Moon with a view to eventually sending astronauts to the lunar surface. The Japanese Space Agency (Jaxa) is also a major force in the region. It is by far the most experienced Asian space agency, with numerous unmanned scientific interplanetary missions under its belt. "India, China and Japan are certainly eyeing each other up," says Prof Coates. The growing rivalry is likely to see a new boom in space exploration - one that will eventually lead to more collaborative missions between the emerging space-faring nations in Asia. That might eventually lead to a truly global effort to send astronauts to Mars. Follow Pallab on Twitter </body>

      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around Â£100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK Â£27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24444431</url>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (Â£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Poor care risk 'at 1 in 4 hospitals'</title>
      <description>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows.</description>

      <body>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows. The findings are based on monitoring by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of a host of data, including death rates, serious errors and patient surveys. It found 44 out of 161 trusts fell into the two highest risk categories. The exercise has been carried out as part of the regulator's new hospital inspection regime, which will see inspectors go into every trust by 2015. The first inspections got under way in September and by Christmas the first 18 will have been completed. It will result in every trust being given a rating of either 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' as part of a shake-up in the system ordered after the Stafford Hospital scandal. The CQC said the latest information was not a final judgement, but would be used to prioritise which trusts to inspect earlier in the process. Hospital chief inspector Prof Sir Mike Richards likened the risk review to a form of "screening". He added: "Our intelligent monitoring helps to give us a good picture of risk within trusts, showing us where we need to focus our inspections." The regulator has assessed each trust's performance against up to 150 different indicators. Those performing worse than would be expected on each indicator get marked down as being at risk or elevated risk for that topic. The number of risk scores they have determines which of the bands they are placed in. Bands one and two - those at highest risk - include 24 trusts and 20 trusts respectively. The trusts in band one include the 11 trusts already placed in special measures after a review of high mortality rates. They are joined by Croydon Health Services, which was rated high risk in 12 areas for issues such as patient survey results and whistle-blowing. Also in band one are Barking, Havering and Redbridge, which was rated high risk in 13 areas including AandE waits and patient surveys, and Aintree, rated high risk in 11 areas including an elevated risk for mortality rates. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon, who is also a CQC board member, said: "It makes sense to use the wealth of routinely available data in the NHS to try to spot patterns which might identify or predict poor quality care for patients. "The intelligent monitoring tool can never by itself be a crystal ball, but it is a great start and will surely develop over time." Labour Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said: "David Cameron should be ashamed that he's put so many of England's hospitals in this position. "He siphoned Â£3bn out of the NHS front-line to blow on a back-office re-organisation nobody voted for. Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos." Use the table below to see how your local trust is rated. Select Trust Name to sort alphabetically or Band to sort by band. Each trust has been put into one of six bands. Bands one and two are the ones classed as high risk, while five and six are the lowest risk. Not all the indicators are applicable to every trust - so trusts have only been assessed against the one relevant to them and a proportionate risk score has been calculated. Where serious concerns have been expressed about a trust already, such as being placed in special measures, the organisation is automatically placed in band one regardless of the risk score. The trusts marked with an * are those that have been elevated for this reason. Source: Care Quality Commission </body>

      <body>Union leaders have voiced optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant. The Unite union said it had decided to "embrace" a survival plan put forward by owner Ineos, "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs when Ineos announced the closure on Wednesday. Workers had rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Speaking after the talks, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Before the meeting, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union Unite would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Unite remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that Ineos would reverse its decision. The company had previously said that while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael are expected to hold talks at Grangemouth on Thursday afternoon. Mr Swinney had earlier said that he hoped the talks between the management and union leaders would be "constructive and successful" He said: "I hope that at this very, very, very late stage in the process there is a willingness to listen to and to consider the proposals being put forward. "Everybody is agreed that this plant has a strong future with the necessary investment and that is why the Scottish government is willing to be a player in that." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest Â£300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that Â£300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <body>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro has died, aged 89. His family confirmed that he had suffered a heart attack on Wednesday. Sir Anthony was widely regarded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. He was awarded many prizes including 2008's Jack Goldhill Award for Sculpture by the Royal Academy of Arts, for a piece called Promenade. The Â£10,000 prize goes to the creator of "an outstanding piece of sculpture". The artist had vowed to keep working until he was 100, as he unveiled his most recent exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London in June. </body>

      <title>Clegg and PM at odds on green levies</title>
      <description>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg says he does not agree with the prime minister's bid to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills.</description>

      <body>The prime minister's announcement that he wanted to "roll back" green levies pushing up energy bills was unexpected, Nick Clegg has said. "It's not something that I fully agree with," the deputy prime minister told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The Lib Dem leader confirmed that the government was to look into whether its environmental policies could be delivered more cost-effectively. They may be funded in future from taxes rather than green levies, he suggested. But he insisted that the coalition's environmental objectives "remain clear and stable". And Downing Street later said work was under way to examine how green levies "can be rolled back from the bills" and paid for by alternative funding. During his Today interview Mr Clegg said in the weeks ahead he and Mr Cameron "will stress-test all these different levies". "If we can deliver those objectives of keeping the lights on, insulating people's homes helping the fuel-poor, supporting the green economy for less, of course I don't want to see an extra penny go on people's bills that is absolutely necessary." But funding for "looking after the environment, securing thousands of jobs in the renewable green sector, and... giving deductions on people's fuel bills for two million of the poorest households in our country" should not end, he argued. This was not the biggest factor driving up energy bills, Mr Clegg added: "In fact, 60% of the increase in energy bills since 2010 have come from wholesale prices." There was, he said, a "big argument" on energy policy, especially since Labour's announcement that it plans to freeze energy bills for 20 months if it wins the next general election. "You've got an argument from Ed Miliband, and it is a con, by the way: his freeze would see prices go up, jobs go down, investment go down. "And then you appear to have a new kind of theory emerging from the right of British politics, which says it is all the fault of us caring about the environment. "I don't accept either of those propositions." Mr Clegg also stressed that he was confident he and the prime minister could "resolve" their differences on the policy. On Wednesday at his weekly Commons question session, Mr Cameron told MPs: "We need to help people pay their bills and we need to help to get bills down. "We need to roll back some of the green regulations and charges that are putting up bills." The Liberal Democrats subsequently accused the PM of making a "panicky U-turn". A senior Lib Dem source said Mr Cameron had got "cold feet" on environmental policy promises. In the Commons, Mr Miliband said 60% of green taxes had been introduced by the current government and reminded the prime minister of his stated ambition to lead the "greenest government" ever. The Labour leader said that Mr Cameron "was changing his policy every day of the week". "His energy secretary says it is nothing to do with green taxes. And who is the man who said 'Vote blue to go green'? It was him," he added. In a speech later, Mr Miliband is expected to argue that the PM has "lost control" of his government amid differences between Conservatives and Liberal Democrats on energy policy. Mr Miliband will accuse the PM of "weakness" and offering no solution to rising household costs, according to pre-released extracts of the speech. </body>

      <body>The Met Office has warned that a storm forecast for Monday could cause disruption in the south of England. An amber alert for wind has been issued and there is also concern that heavy rain could cause flooding. The Met Office said the public in the affected area "should be prepared for the risk of falling trees as well as damage to buildings and other structures" caused by strong winds. There is uncertainty about the timing of the storm at this stage. Colin Seddon from the BBC Weather Centre said it "is certainly the worst storm we've seen this year". He said there is potential for gusts of wind over 80mph, especially on exposed coasts in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent. </body>

      <title>US ambassador summoned in mobile row</title>
      <description>Germany summons the US ambassador in Berlin over claims that the US monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.</description>

      <body>Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over claims that the US monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle will meet US envoy John Emerson later in what is seen as an unusual step between close allies. Mrs Merkel has demanded a "complete explanation" of the claims, which are threatening to overshadow an EU summit. She discussed the issue with US President Barack Obama on Wednesday. President Obama told Mrs Merkel the US was not monitoring her calls and would not in future, the White House said. However, it left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. On Monday France summoned the US ambassador over reports in Le Monde newspaper that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had spied on millions of French phone calls. A day later, Le Monde reported that the NSA had spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN. French President Francois Hollande had already called for the issue to be put on the agenda of the summit, where EU leaders are due to discuss Europe's digital economy, economic recovery and immigration. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its NSA in Europe, says BBC Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt. The German government has not said how it received the tip about the alleged US spying. But news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published stories based on material from former CIA contractor Edward Snowden, said the information had come from its investigations. A Der Spiegel report in September that the US NSA had cracked the security codes the protect data on iPhones, Blackberries and Android devices led to demonstrations in Berlin. A number of US allies have expressed anger over the Snowden-based spying allegations. State-monitoring of phone calls has a particular resonance in Germany - Mrs Merkel herself grew up in East Germany, where phone-tapping was pervasive. Her spokesman said the German leader "views such practices... as completely unacceptable" and had demanded a "complete and comprehensive explanation". "Among close friends and partners, as the Federal Republic of Germany and the US have been for decades, there should be no such monitoring of the communications of a head of government," said Steffen Seibert in a statement. Veteran French European Commissioner Michel Barnier told the BBC "enough is enough" and that confidence in the US had been shaken. Mr Barnier, the commissioner for internal market and services, said Europe must not be naive but develop its own strategic digital tools, such as a "European data cloud" independent of American oversight. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says Germany's morning papers echo a sense of outrage. A front-page commentary in Thursday's Sueddeutscher Zeitung - one of the country's most respected papers - refers to the "biggest affront". It says an attack on Angela Merkel's mobile phone would be an attack on "her political heart". German Defence Minister Thomas de Maiziere said it would not be possible to go back to business as usual. This is more than a tiff which will blow over easily, our correspondent says. In July, German media carried comments by Mr Snowden suggesting the US National Security Agency worked closely with Germany and other Western states on a "no questions asked" basis, monitoring German internet traffic, emails and phone calls. "They [the NSA] are in bed with the Germans, just like with most other Western states," Mr Snowden was quoted as saying by Der Spiegel magazine - though Mrs Merkel denied any knowledge of the collaboration. In June, President Obama assured Chancellor Merkel that German citizens were not being routinely spied upon. At the time, she was criticised by her political opponents for not being more sceptical. </body>

      <body>A plane fighting bushfires in the Australian state of New South Wales has crashed, killing its pilot, as the military faced criticism for starting one of the major fires. The water-bombing plane crashed near Ulladulla, south of Sydney. Meanwhile the military said it was co-operating with a fire services probe that found an exercise using live ordnance started the State Mine fire. NSW has been battling bushfires for days, amid high temperatures. Officials have yet to release the identity of the pilot, who was the only person aboard the aircraft. His family has been informed of his death. "It's a tragedy for the fire-fighting community," said NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Thousands of firefighters have been mobilised to tackle the fires, and on Wednesday the state came through what officials had said would be a very dangerous day because of weather conditions. Thursday brought cooler weather but more than 60 fires are still burning. Worst-hit has been the Blue Mountains area, to the west of Sydney, where many homes have been destroyed and some residents evacuated. The State Mine blaze, near the Blue Mountains town of Lithgow, was seen as a serious cause for concern earlier in the week. Fire chief Shane Fitzsimmons said an investigation had found it was ignited by live ordnance. "It wasn't deliberate, it was a side-effect of a routine activity ... and clearly there was no intention to see fire start up and run as a result of that activity," he said. Acting Defence Minister George Brandis said the military "take this issue very seriously and continue to fully co-operate with the NSW authorities, including the NSW Police, who are investigating the fire". Acting Chief of Defence Air Marshall Mark Binskin subsequently offered an apology, saying: "What I do know to date is it was an explosives activity, it was a demolition activity in support of our people that train for operations around the world". Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill said the military should have known better. "I would have hoped on a day like that which was a dry day, a hot day, with the winds, the Australian military would have known it wasn't a good time to be igniting. So far the NSW fires have destroyed more than 200 homes and left one man dead. Meanwhile, former US Vice-President Al Gore has entered the debate over climate change, calling on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott not to repeal the carbon tax. On Wednesday, Mr Abbott accused the UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, of "talking through her hat" when she described bushfires as "absolutely" linked to climate change. Mr Gore told ABC News: "Bushfires can occur naturally, and do, but the science shows clearly that when the temperature goes up, and when the vegetation and soils dry out, then wildfires become more pervasive and more dangerous. "The meaningful way to solve this crisis is to put a price on carbon, and in Australia's case to keep a price on carbon," he said. Mr Abbott is working to repeal a tax on carbon introduced by the Labor government that charges Australia's top 300 polluters for their emissions. He says the tax cost jobs and drove energy prices up, and intends to replace it with a subsidies scheme.

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>Nick Clegg has promised to set up a "champions league" of head teachers to be brought in to sort out failing schools in England. In a speech, the deputy prime minister said experienced staff could join a "pool of top talent" which would be "ready to move" at short notice. He also said free schools and academies must only employ professionally qualified teachers. Labour said voters could not trust what Mr Clegg said on this subject. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that unqualified teachers currently working in schools would not be sacked under his proposals, but would instead be given the opportunity to "seek qualifications while you are teaching". He said the rules would not apply to private schools, which also employ teachers without professional qualifications, because "you pay your fees and you take your choice", but children using taxpayer-funded schools had a right to expect basic standards. Before the coalition relaxed the rules, state-funded schools could only employ teachers on a permanent basis if they had completed teacher training, regardless of their other qualifications or experience. The number of unqualified teachers in free schools and academies has gone up from 2,200 in 2010 to 5,300 last year, according to Education Department figures, although the overall number of unqualified teachers in the state sector as a whole has fallen. In his speech, Mr Clegg announced that, from September next year, the government would create a "programme to get outstanding leaders into the schools that need them the most". The team would be made up of head teachers and deputy heads, with recruitment beginning soon, he said. Parts of the Liberal Democrat leader's speech had been heavily trailed in the media for several days, particularly his expression of differences with the Conservatives over free schools, which are state-funded but autonomous. He acknowledged "differences of opinion, some strongly held", stating that his party wants all schools to follow the national curriculum, guarantee food standards and employ only qualified teachers. He said this "view has sparked quite a bit of excitement this week - and criticism", but added that he wants parents to make their educational choices "safe in the knowledge that there are certain safeguards". Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position on free schools, saying that, as recently as last week, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Clegg said: "I am totally unapologetic that the Liberal Democrats have our own ideas." Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Nick Clegg will be judged on what he does, not what he says. "Whatever he says about free schools today, the truth is this divisive policy is his - enacted by his Tory-led government because of his help and support." </body>

      <body>A staff member at a mental health centre has been charged with helping a convicted murderer escape from custody. Lerone Boye, 27, was jailed for life in December for stabbing a 17-year-old boy to death at a birthday party in 2011. He was being held at the John Howard Centre in Homerton, east London, when he absconded on 16 October. Dean Ablakwa, 29, from north London, will appear at Thames Magistrates' Court later charged with conspiracy to assist an offender to escape. Officers in Hackney are continuing to appeal for help in tracing Boye, who is described as black, about 5ft 10in and slim, with short black hair. He has a scar on his right cheek, a goatee beard and a gold tooth in his upper row of teeth. Police have released an image of Boye moments before he escaped. People are advised not to approach him but dial 999. Boye was ordered to serve a minimum of 28 years for stabbing Kelvin Chibueze at the Arteflex Club in Ilford, east London. He was chased out of a birthday party and attacked with glass and broken bottles. </body>

      <body>The heads of GCHQ, the Security Service and the Secret Intelligence Service are to testify in public at a parliamentary committee for the first time. The Intelligence and Security Committee has said it will hear from GCHQ's Sir Iain Lobban, MI5's Andrew Parker and MI6's Sir John Sawers on 7 November. MPs and peers would seek to "give an insight into the world of intelligence, and the work the Agencies do on behalf of the UK", the committee added. The hearing will be broadcast, it said. The evidence session is expected to last for about an hour and a half. In a statement on its website, the committee said: "It represents a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies. "The committee will question the agency heads on the work of the agencies, their current priorities and the threats to the UK. "Among other things it will cover the terrorist threat, regional instability and weapons proliferation, cyber security and espionage. "However, since this is a public session, it will not cover details of intelligence capabilities or techniques, ongoing operations or sub judice matters [i.e. those currently being considered in the courts]. "The committee questions the agencies about these details in their closed sessions." The committee would broadcast its proceedings with a delay so that it retained the power to pause transmission of proceedings "if anything is mentioned which might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies", it added. Only parliamentary pass holders and "a small number of print journalists" would be able to take up the "limited number of seats available in the meeting room itself", the committee said. Members of the committee include former cabinet secretary Lord Butler of Brockwell, Labour's former communities secretary Hazel Blears, and ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Menzies Campbell. The committee is chaired by Conservative MP and former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind. </body>

      <description>Discount clothes chain Primark says it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh.</description>

      <body>Discount clothes chain Primark has said it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. Primark told the BBC it would continue to pay the wages of those affected for another three months. The collapse, which happened in April, killed more than 1,100 people. International firms have since faced criticism for lack of collective action to improve the working conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories. In addition to the death toll, more than 2,500 were injured in the disaster. Last month, the global trade union IndustriALL called a meeting of some of the world's largest retailers in Geneva to discuss a long-term compensation fund of $74.6m (Â£47.2m) for the workers injured in the disaster, and the families of those who died. However, only nine of the 23 brands being produced at the Rana Plaza factory were represented at the meeting. Key absentees included Wal-Mart and Benetton and the retailers failed to reach a deal on a compensation fund for victims. The garments manufacturing sector is a key driver of Bangladesh's economy. However, a series of incidents has raised concerns over the working conditions in some of the factories in the country. Last November, 112 workers were killed in a fire at another clothes factory in the same area, and nine died in a blaze earlier this month at a garment manufacturer, again near the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. In September, the BBC's Panorama programme reported that Bangladeshi garment workers had been locked in on 19-hour shifts. As a result, there have been calls to improve the conditions at the units, prompting some action from various stakeholders. But earlier this week, Bangladesh and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreed to launch a $24m initiative to improve the conditions of garment workers. In May, many international retailers agreed to a new code of practice regarding safety inspections for factories. At the time of the IndustriALL meeting, Primark said that it would continue to pay wages to those affected by the fire and building collapse for another three months, having paid for the previous three. The new announcement takes the total to nine months. In his first interview with the BBC, Paul Lister, head of corporate governance at Primark's parent company, Associated British Foods, said that "a lot has been done" since the fire to improve standards, and that the events of April were a "huge tragedy". "We looked on in horror. We knew our clothes were in the building, and we accepted responsibility," he said. When asked what he thought about other retailers not participating in compensation schemes, he said there was "still a long way to go" and that it was "time for others to step up". Mr Lister added that Primark would also welcome a rise in the minimum wage for garment workers. The minimum wage for a worker in such a factory is currently around 3,000 Bangladeshi taka a month (about Â£24; $40). When shown a Primark T-shirt costing just Â£2.50 and asked whether selling cheap clothes meant the people making them had to endure low pay and long hours, he said this was not the case, and that Primark's clothes were "ethically sourced". Mr Lister added that Primark and other low-price retailers often shared factory facilities and manufacturing bases with much more expensive brands. "We share 95% of our factories with other high street retailers. We share factories with Bond Street retailers. It's the same conditions, the same workforce, the same pay." "We know the factory where that T-shirt is made, we will have inspected that factory... we often sit outside factories to make sure the timesheets are correct." Mr Lister insisted that although a worker in a Bangladeshi factory would earn around 10p an hour, the garment industry had a positive impact on the country. "There are four million employed [in the textile industry], 80% of Bangladeshi exports are clothes. It is a way to alleviate poverty. It is a force for good." </body>

      <body>A pop concert for armed forces families will kick off this year's Poppy Appeal, which has a target of raising Â£37m. Acts including The Saturdays, Union J, Tich, and Luminites will take part in the event at RAF Northolt in west London on Thursday evening. Organisers at the Royal British Legion said military families were at the heart of the appeal for 2013. The Duchess of Cornwall will also visit The Poppy Factory in Richmond, Surrey, where the poppies are made. Ahead of her visit, The Poppy Factory announced that the duchess would become its patron. Wreaths, poppies and crosses for Remembrance Day events are handmade by disabled veterans at the Poppy Factory. The charity also helps disabled veterans find employment with other companies across the country. Chief executive Melanie Waters said: "The Poppy Factory uses its unique expertise to help disabled veterans into work with many businesses throughout the UK. "The patronage of The Duchess will help us to continue this work and to highlight the increasing need to support our disabled veterans into meaningful civilian employment." The Poppy Girls will sing this year's official Poppy Appeal single The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye). The group of five daughters of active service personnel was assembled after a national talent search. The Legion needs Â£1.6m a week to fund its work giving help, advice and support to the armed forces community. L/Cpl Cassidy Little, 32, of 42 Commando Royal Marines, is among those due to attend the concert. He benefitted from a theatre project supported by the Royal British Legion after he lost his lower right limb in an IED explosion in Afghanistan in May 2011. He said: "The theatre project funded by the Royal British Legion was a turning point in my recovery. "While the medical teams put my body back together, taking part in the play gave me back my self-esteem and confidence when it was at its lowest ebb." George Shelley, of X Factor boy band Union J, and who has a brother serving in the Royal Marines, said the poppy was a "symbol of pride". Royal British Legion fundraising director Charles Byrne said: "We support the entire armed forces community past and present, but families are at the heart of the Poppy Appeal in 2013. "We recognise the strength of mothers, fathers, partners and kids in armed forces families, who serve alongside their loved ones every single day and often need practical care and advice too. "We're encouraging people to dig deep for the Poppy Appeal so we can continue providing this vital support to individuals whether they're still serving, transitioning back to civilian life or have left the services, but importantly to their dependents too." The Poppy Appeal in Scotland was launched by Craig and Charlie Reid from The Proclaimers in Edinburgh on Wednesday. </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when it reopens next year. The Bletchley Park Trust is restoring the site near Milton Keynes and expects to get 250,000 visitors a year. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to reopen the site in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <body>The owner of shoe maker Dr Martens has been bought by the investment firm Permira Funds for Â£300m. R Griggs Group, based in Wollaston, near Northampton, has been making boots since 1901, but became famous with its Dr Martens boot in the 1960s. It will add to Permira's portfolio of fashion businesses which includes Hugo Boss, New Look and Spain's Cortefiel. Griggs was the first firm to use an air-cushioned sole, developed by Munich based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck. The boot that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s. Dr Martens also credit Peter Townshend, guitarist and songwriter for the Who, as another early adopter. According to the company, Mr Townshend says that, while on tour, he would go to bed with two things: a cognac bottle and a Dr Martens boot. </body>

The company said on Wednesday it would have to close the plant after workers there rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. John Hofmeister, a former president of Shell Oil and the author of Why We Hate the Oil Companies, told the Today programme's Sarah Montague the news of Grangemouth's closure did not come as a surprised. "By using Brent crude oil, the price of that crude coming into the plant for either chemicals or refining purposes - it is the most expensive crude that's out there, so Grangemouth faces a disadvantage in terms of crude oil relative to other refineries because of the higher price," he explained.

      <body>Healthy people should not take aspirin to ward off heart attacks and cancer, according to the most comprehensive review of the risks and benefits. There has been growing debate about whether all people over 50 should take a daily, low dose aspirin. But the review, conducted by the research arm of the NHS, said it was a "fine balance" due to the dangers of bleeding in the brain and stomach. Overall it warned against taking the drug, until there was more evidence. Aspirin makes the blood less sticky so it reduces the odds of a blood clot forming inside the body, which could cause a heart attack or stroke. There are even studies suggesting it can cut the risk of some cancers. However, as the drug makes it harder for the blood to clot it can cause problems inside the body. The drug is given to people at high risk of a heart attack or stroke as the medical benefit is clear. However, there have been calls to give aspirin to otherwise healthy people as well. A team at Warwick Medical School was asked to assess the evidence by the NHS National Institute for Health Research. For heart attacks and strokes, they concluded giving everyone aspirin would cause "net harm due to increased potential for bleeding". This was in part due to better management of at-risk patients including prescribing drugs to lower blood pressure. On cancer, they concluded the evidence was not strong enough to base a decision on, but trials taking place would give clearer proof in the next five years. Prof Aileen Clarke, who led the review, told the BBC: "The risks are finely balanced and for now there is not the evidence to advise people to take it. "It would be lovely to say over-50s should take an aspirin a day and have much less cancer, but the research hasn't yet been done and we should be cautious. "We need to be extremely careful about over-promoting aspirin." </body>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; Â£210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <description>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet.</description>

      <body>An international team of astronomers has detected the most distant galaxy yet. The galaxy is about 30 billion light-years away and is helping scientists shed light on the period that immediately followed the Big Bang. It was found using the Hubble Space Telescope and its distance was then confirmed with the ground-based Keck Observatory in Hawaii. The study is published in the journal Nature. Because it takes light so long to travel from the outer edge of the Universe to us, the galaxy appears as it was 13.1 billion years ago (its distance from Earth of 30 billion light-years is because the Universe is expanding). Lead researcher Steven Finkelstein, from the University of Texas at Austin, US, said: "This is the most distant galaxy we've confirmed. We are seeing this galaxy as it was 700 million years after the Big Bang." The far-off galaxy goes by the catchy name of z8_GND_5296. Astronomers were able to measure how far it was from Earth by analysing its colour. Because the Universe is expanding and everything is moving away from us, light waves are stretched. This makes objects look redder than they actually are. Astronomers rate this apparent colour-change on a scale that is called redshift. They found that this galaxy has a redshift of 7.51, beating the previous record-holder, which had a redshift of 7.21. This makes it the most distant galaxy ever found. The system is small: about 1-2% the mass of the Milky Way and is rich in heavier elements. But it has a surprising feature: it is turning gas and dust into new stars at a remarkable rate, churning them out hundreds of times faster than our own galaxy can. It is the second far-flung galaxy known that has been found to have a high star-production rate. Prof Finkelstein said: "One very interesting way to learn about the Universe is to study these outliers and that tells us something about what sort of physical processes are dominating galaxy formation and galaxy evolution. "What was great about this galaxy is not only is it so distant, it is also pretty exceptional." He added that in the coming years, astronomers are likely to discover even more distant galaxies when Nasa's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is launched and other ground-based telescopes come online. Commenting on the research, Dr Marek Kukula, Public Astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, told BBC News: "This, along with some other evidence, shows that there are already quite surprisingly evolved galaxies in the very early Universe . "This high star-formation rate maybe is a clue as to why these galaxies can form so quickly." Prof Alfonso Aragon-Salamanca, from the University of Nottingham, added: "This is an important step forward, but we need to continue looking for more. "The further away we go, the closer we will get to discovering the very first stars that ever formed in the Universe. The next generation of telescopes will make this possible." But Dr Stephen Serjeant from the Open University said: "Chasing ultra-high redshift galaxies is a very exciting but equally very difficult game, and many claims of extremely distant galaxies have since turned out to be more nearby interlopers." </body>

      <body>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked". The adaptation of James Jones' uncensored 1951 novel is Sir Tim's first totally new musical for 13 years. Written with composer Stuart Brayson, the story follows the love affairs of US soldiers stationed in Hawaii in the run up to the attack on Pearl Harbour. The new version includes swearing, nudity and a scene in a gay bar. Some of the more explicit scenes will come as a surprise to fans of the 1953 Oscar-winning film, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, which included a famous scene in which the couple share a passionate clinch on a beach. "The film was wonderful but it was made in 1953 and, 67 years on, we can take different aspects of the book and look at it through 21st Century eyes," Sir Tim told the BBC after Wednesday's opening night. "Some people might be mildly shocked but I think we've all got used to a bit of that these days. It's quite mild compared with Book of Mormon or even Billy Elliot." The cast includes Darius Campbell as Sergeant Warden, Rebecca Thornhill as his married lover Karen Holmes, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, Siubhan Harrison as his lover Lorene, and Ryan Sampson as Private Maggio. Campbell said that, during previews, there had been some walkouts from the show due to its content. "The James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. We've explored that in a way that's very real and gritty, and honours the story." The Scottish singing star, who shot to fame as Darius Danesh on TV show Pop Idol, went on: "It hasn't been without some of the older audience walking out. "Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film - and wanted to see more - have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." 'Quite dangerous' Sir Tim Rice is best known for his partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber on shows such as Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. Lord Lloyd-Webber's new West End musical Stephen Ward is due to open in December. Sir Tim confirmed that his former writing partner had already seen a preview of From Here to Eternity. "He was very complimentary and I'm hoping to see his show," he said. Sir Tim's last full musical was 2000's Aida, which he wrote with Elton John. The pair had earlier worked together on The Lion King. From Here to Eternity sees the Oscar-winning lyricist team up with the relatively unknown Brayson. The pair first met in the 1980s when Brayson approached Sir Tim in the street and asked him to listen one of his songs on cassette. "I played it in car on way home. I rang him up and said this is rather good. I couldn't do much to help his pop career but when he began writing musicals I thought, 'maybe I can help,'" Sir Tim said. Although Sir Tim hadn't intended to be involved in writing the musical, as the production took shape he "ended up doing all the lyrics apart from one or two lines". Brayson told the BBC: "I must have sent him eight or nine musicals and this was the one that he really went for. "We didn't set out to do the movie. We set out out to do something that was different and quite dangerous in parts." In the audience on Wednesday night was James Jones' daughter, Kaylie, and her brother, Jamie. "We had our doubts when the idea first came up," she admitted after the show "but I'm thrilled - it's so sophisticated and moving." She added: "I was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes because my dad said this is just the way it was back then. "I think my father would have been amazed." From Here to Eternity, directed by Tamara Harvey, is booking at the Shaftesbury Theatre , London, until 26 April 2014. </body>

      <body>A notorious piece of music once denounced as "filth for filth's sake" is going to be performed live in this country for the first time. Frank Zappa's 200 Motels, a colossal work for full orchestra, rock band, singers and actors, was banned on the grounds of obscenity in 1971. Now more than 40 years later, it will be performed at the Royal Festival Hall next week. Frank Zappa died in 1993 and, in a rare interview, his widow Gail Zappa spoke to the BBC's arts correspondent Rebecca Jones. One woman explained why the performance was rejected by the Royal Albert Hall. "You could say it was connected with sex," she said.

      <body>The high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. A new documentary asks if it's possible to find the perfect flatmate. The 1990s black comedy Shallow Grave has always been a kind of cautionary tale for housesharers. Both interviewing people and being interviewed can be unpleasant and it's easy to pick someone who turns out to be a less than delightful match. Rent has been rocketing in recent years in London and other parts of the UK, taking a one-bedroom flat out of the reach of many people. The Office for National Statistics doesn't measure housesharing specifically, but you can get a feel of numbers from the 2011 census. There were 1,850,137 households which were neither one person nor a family in England and Wales. This accounts for 7.9% of all households, an increase from 6.7% in 2001. The socially fussy will only share with people who are already friends, or vouched for by a friend. Others opt for particular websites like Gumtree, Spareroom and Moveflat. There are still some who browse the ballpoint pen scrawl on cards in newsagents' windows. The truly exotic might attend a "speedflatmating" event. Like speed dating, the idea is to allow the tenants to meet several people at the same time without having to go through the process of "interviewing" people one by one. Being forced together with other people by economics, housesharers want to pick the right person. There are sometimes surprising demands - those wanting food included, or people with multiple unusual pets. A new Channel 4 documentary, How to Find the Perfect Flatmate, explores the difficult process. The strangeness of the whole experience is summed up in He Died With A Falafel in His Hand, the memoirs-cum-novel of serial housesharer John Birmingham. When he was picking people to live with he had three questions he always asked: But there's a serious side to living with strangers. Can they be trusted? Is it safe to be around them? This has to be guessed from a few minutes over a cup of tea with another candidate waiting on the doorstep. What happens if you get an unreliable alcoholic who happens to visit on his one lucid day? But bad surprises can happen even with someone who is supposed to be a friend. Genevieve (not her real name) shared a flat in New York with her boyfriend, a friend and one of their classmates, Ben. "In September, Ben arrived with no socks in New York, so we each lent him three pairs of socks. As the weeks went by, he still didn't have any socks and we had fewer and fewer socks in our own drawers. All three of us had lost at least five pairs of socks. "One day during November, we went into his bedroom because we were suspicious. Under the bed we saw a whole stack of dirty socks. When we tried to confront him, he wouldn't listen and told us that we were being childish, that these were 'only socks', that it wasn't a big deal. "And this was true I guess, but the point was that he had crossed a line. If he was capable of going into our rooms when we weren't there and looking into our stuff, this meant that he was capable of maybe doing something worse." The whole experience left Genevieve thinking it was better to live with strangers. It avoids the false sense of security at least. Still, at least vaguely knowing someone before living with them is a comfort to many. "I can see the appeal of living with someone new and meeting different people. But it's safer to live with someone you know or someone that is a friend of a friend," says Joshi Herrmann, 24, a journalist at the London Evening Standard who lives with three friends. Herrmann is dubious about the way potential housemates describe themselves online. "They say things like 'I am very hard working', 'I am very neat and tidy' etc. It's as if they are trying to counter someone's impression of the worst flatmate but actually they make themselves look more boring than anything else." When he last advertised for someone for a cramped dark room in his houseshare in east London, he got more than 50 messages in the space of a few days. The housemates only met six potentials and in the end picked a friend of a friend. The theory is that the travails of living with random strangers are best borne when young. When you're skint and in your early 20s it doesn't seem to be so bad to be living with someone who occasionally nicks your milk and plays Sepultura at three in the morning. But there's a generation of older housemates in many parts of the UK now. Over the past five years, the fastest growing age group of sharers on the SpareRoom website has been 45-54-year-olds, who are up by 50%. The total number of flatsharers over 35 has increased by 26%. Birmingham says his book struck a chord with people who have lived in houseshares because there are really only five or six houseshare stories in the whole world. There's mad flatmate, bad flatmate, dirty flatmate and so on. Anyone who's done it has had at least one bad experience. "As long as people share accommodation together, those stories will always be relevant. The archetypes never die. And they never pay their rent." What are your tips for selecting housemates?

      <body>Prince George's christening on Wednesday comes 31 years after his father Prince William in 1982. Here are 10 ways in which baptisms have changed since then. George's christening is the exception rather than the rule. And not just because he's a royal. Although christenings were already in decline, one in three infants was still baptised into the Church of England in 1980. By 2011 that had fallen to just over one in 10. The overall number of baptisms - of people of all ages - witnessed a similar decline, from 266,000 in 1980 to 140,000 in 2011. It's a similar story in the Catholic Church, although the major drop-off in baptisms happened between 1964 and 1977, when the number halved. There's been a far gentler downward trend over the past three decades, recently stabilising at about 60,000 baptisms a year. Christenings may have dwindled but the number of godparents per child has increased. Prince George will have seven. Elizabeth Hurley's son apparently has six godfathers. And it's not just a celebrity fad. "In practice it seems to be changing," says the Archdeacon of Leicester, Tim Stratford, although there's been no doctrinal change. That's because both the Church of England and the Catholic Church only have minimum requirements, of three and one respectively. "It used to be the minimum that was the issue," says Stratford. "Now the issue for a lot of clergy is that often people are choosing a lot of godparents. "The registers we have, for instance, often only have four spaces to put godparents' names but people may be choosing six or eight." A godparent is supposed to mentor the child in their faith. And the rules haven't changed. "Because of what godparent strictly means, we only have practising Catholics as godparents, and fellow Christians as 'special witnesses'," says Fr Paul Keane, a parish priest in Essex. The Church of England does not distinguish between denominations, says Stratford. "The only requirement for godparents is that they should have been baptised. A Muslim or a Hindu cannot strictly speaking be a godparent, nor can a secularist who has not been baptised." While the Church does insist on godparents being baptised, that may not be uniformly enforced across all parishes. Stratford acknowledges that in practice the godparent's role is broader than just a religious one. "Providing the child has enough godparents, there's nothing to stop people being 'honorary godparents', without technically being one. That is fairly common in the Church," he says, explaining that the Church is soon to advise using the term "supporting friend". "It's the Church trying to catch up with emerging trends in society." People may be less religious but many are reluctant to relinquish all church traditions. "Naming ceremonies are on the rise and are something that we would probably expect to see increase in the coming years," says Sarah Barrett, managing editor of parenting website BabyCentre. These were almost non-existent about 15 years ago but now there are hundreds every year, according to the British Humanist Association. "The lack of religious belief is why they're becoming more popular," says Barrett, with many enjoying "the idea of officially welcoming the baby into the world and introducing them to friends and family". And while they may have rejected religion, they haven't rejected religious terminology. "'Godparent' is a much easier term to explain to people than 'supportive mentor'," says Barrett. Plus, Marlon Brando has never portrayed a "supportive mentor". In 1992, almost 80% of Church of England baptisms were of babies under a year old. By 2011 this had dropped to about 60%. One in three Church of England christenings is now of a child between the ages of one and 12. "Traditionally christenings took place when the child was a baby but now more and more parents are waiting until they've had a second child and then getting both christened together," says Barrett. Sort of like a two-for-one deal. But it's only partially about cost, she says. "Parents like to do it when the child will perhaps remember the ceremony." High competition for school places is credited with creating a new phenomenon - the "bogus" baptism - where the primary motivation is to get a child into a faith school. "To be sure that I could have the privilege of having my son going to my local state school I had to pretend to be an Anglican," says atheist Andrew Penman, author of School Daze: My Search for a Decent State Secondary School. "It wasn't something I did for kicks or to undermine anyone else's faith. I did it under duress because that's really the only way I could be sure of getting into my local state school," he says, adding that he felt "embarrassed" and "awkward" during the ceremony. Penman feels the practice is widespread, indicating that the numbers of people attending church "fall off a cliff after the children get past the threshold at which they either get or don't get a [school] place". The word "bogus" is a bit strong in her case, says Jane, who prefers not give her real name. A lapsed Catholic with a non-religious Jewish husband, she says she'd always wanted her children to have a religious grounding. "But I'd be lying if I said I didn't have the idea of schooling in my head. The most 'bogus' aspect is the time pressure," she says, admitting that she baptised her second child much earlier than her first after reading a parish newspaper warning that Catholic schools would be making the entrance criteria more stringent. "[It said] it would be a good idea to get your child christened in the first four months of their life," she says. It's difficult to gauge how widespread the practice is. Keane thinks that, if it's an issue at all, it's most likely to be in areas where Christian schools are oversubscribed, such as London. Both he and Stratford think that the preparation time and public nature of services mitigate the likelihood of large numbers doing so. "My experience has been that parents invariably wanted to mean what they were saying," says Stratford. George will be baptised in a replica of the same traditional white christening gown as his father and every monarch since Edward VII. But it's an increasing rarity. "Christening gowns are a bit out of fashion right now," says Barrett. "At [the baptismal] classes we were told that you no longer have to dress your child in a traditional gown," says Becky Bevis, who has a 13-month-old son. "He wore a white shirt and some baby chino trousers." None of the other four children baptised that day wore a gown either, she says. "What the Church simply asks is that the child is wrapped up in a white garment as a sign of their new life with Christ after they're baptised," says Keane. "Unless you've got an heirloom or a family tradition of passing down the christening gown, such as the royals, lots of mums will get their children dressed in cute outfits, pretty outfits, or christening nappies," says Barrett. Christenings are big business. Designers such as Vera Wang have got in on the action, while John Lewis witnessed an 8% growth in christening gift sales in the past year. Although the tradition for silver gifts still prevails, it seems to be less strictly adhered to. "We didn't receive any silver," says Bevis of her son's baptism, while she received a silver spoon for her own christening three decades ago. The penchant for silver rattles is waning, says Barrett. "Now planting trees is quite popular as a christening gift, as are things that you can give to the baby that are for future years," she says. "Some people give whisky that is meant to be drunk when the child reaches 21." Even those sticking to traditional silver may be cutting corners. Of John Lewis's premium christening gifts, only 55% were actually silver plate, with 40% pewter and 5% stainless steel. Babies may still cry from time to time, but it's far less likely to be the shrill shriek after being doused in freezing water. "Water's being warmed up in the fonts these days simply because churches can do it," says Stratford. "You wouldn't have to go very long ago to find most country churches having no electricity. How then would you provide warm water? It's got to be a relatively new phenomenon." Some rural churches may not yet have the capacity. "More and more churches are putting kitchens in so it's possible to boil a kettle and warm the water up," he says. The Church of England is still developing its language for the service. Until 1980 christening services were still given in 17th Century language. But while the Alternative Service Book introduced modern language, it provided "quite a thin service, with short questions and fewer [of them]", says Stratford. The Common Worship, introduced in 2000, hasn't pleased everybody. "The clergy thought that the language was too complex, [as were] the services themselves." It prompted the general synod in 2011 to agree new language was required, although the specifics have not yet been agreed. "It's not a dumbing-down of the language or the use of colloquialisms," says Stratford, nor about brevity or a loss of poetry, but about making the language less high-brow. Questions over the use of the word "submit" - as in "Do you submit to Christ as Lord?" - were also raised. "It felt quite inquisitorial," he says. "It was not easy for a lot of people to respond to that question because it was felt that 'submit' meant giving up and communicated the wrong meaning."

      <title>Man City referee 'should be banned'</title>
      <description>The referee for Manchester City's game in Moscow should be banned for failing to deal with racist chants, says Kick It Out</description>

      <body>The referee for Manchester City's game against CSKA Moscow should not officiate again after failing to deal with racist abuse, says Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley. City's Yaya Toure complained to Ovidiu Hategan about racist chants from CSKA fans during the Champions League win. "The referee should not be refereeing again," Ouseley told BBC Radio 5 live. "He failed to do his duty last night and that is a clear issue that Uefa should be dealing with." Under guidelines issued in 2009 by Uefa - European football's governing body - referees have the power to try to stop racist chanting from supporters. A referee can, as a first step, stop the match and ask for announcements to be made over the public address system. The second step is to suspend the match for a period and, finally, to abandon it. Since Toure reported the abuse to the referee during the game and spoke to him afterwards, the incident will be included in the official's report, which will be sent to Uefa on Thursday. Manchester City have also lodged a formal complaint with Uefa, though the BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg said CSKA Moscow claim Toure was the only person to hear the chants. Lord Ouseley, who heads Kick It Out,Â  one of the leading anti-discrimination bodies in England, continued: "Firstly, why did the ref not do his job which was to stop the game and to make sure that problem was dealt with?" And he added that the incident would also test new sanctions issued by Uefa. In May, it announced that, in the case of racist incidents involving spectators, a partial stadium closure would be applied for the first offence and a full stadium closure for a second, coupled with a fine of 50,000 euros (Â£42,800). "[Uefa] need to enforce the regulations that have been brought into play to deal with these type of offences and this will be a test for Uefa. "Will they do what they have always done and have sanctions that are applied in a way that will not stop this happening again? And if they don't do that, it brings the question: what are clubs going to do to protect their players? What is the union going to do to protect their players?" Ouseley said that if players were not adequately protected, there could be more cases of them walking off the pitch, as when former AC Milan player Kevin Prince-Boateng forced the abandonment of a friendly match between his side and an Italian lower division team over racist abuse. "It seems to me the only alternative is to provide them with the power to do what Prince-Boateng did last season with Milan and walk off the pitch because this is the only way we can bring sanity to the situation," he added. "This has gone on for too long. Uefa and Fifa take us for mugs, and that can't go on any longer." </body>

      <body>India's Supreme Court will hear a petition on Friday which is seeking the cancellation of this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. The petition was filed on the grounds that the organisers have allegedly not paid taxes for a previous event. "We will hear the petition tomorrow," said Chief Justice P. Sathasivam. A spokesman for the circuit's owner, Jaypee Sports International Limited, said: "Whatever the court says, we are ready to follow." Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who leads rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by 90 points with 100 still available, could clinch his fourth title in India this Sunday. The German, who has led every racing lap at the Indian Grand Prix since its debut in 2011, will triumph if he finishes fifth or higher, regardless of where Alonso finishes. The Supreme Court in India has executive powers and ordered circuit bosses two years ago to freeze 25% of ticket revenues until they had settled an outstanding tax dispute. That ruling followed Public Interest Litigation filed by campaigner Amit Kumar, the same man who is behind Thursday's petition. The long-term future of the Indian Grand Prix is already uncertain after F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone removed the race from the 2014 calendar. Organisers are trying to find a new date for its return in 2015, with Ecclestone keen for the race to take place in the early part of the season, rather than its current October date. </body>

      <body>Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney says he has been given a "new lease of life" under manager David Moyes. The England international looked set to leave United after falling out with Sir Alex Ferguson, who has since retired. Ferguson wrote in his new autobiography that Rooney lost his "old thrust" in the Scot's final season in charge because he was not fit enough. "That's the past, I'm looking to the future," said Rooney after the 1-0 win over Real Sociedad. Rooney, who celebrates his 28th birthday on Thursday, was impressive as United overcame the Spanish side on Wednesday to take another step towards the Champions League last 16. Sociedad defender Inigo Martinez put the ball into his own net while trying to clear a Rooney effort that had come back off a post. Rooney, speaking for the first time since the contents of Ferguson's autobiography were revealed, said he had not seen his former manager since he retired at the end of the season. Moyes has endured an indifferent start since taking over as manager from Ferguson, the former Everton boss winning just three of his first eight Premier League games in charge. But Rooney says he is "happy" and enjoying life under his former Goodison Park boss "The new coach that has come in [and has given me] a new lease of life," he said. "I'm really enjoy working under David Moyes." Rooney is also glad that Ferguson has made it clear in his latest book that he never formally asked for a transfer at the end of last season. "He has come back and corrected the story that I put a transfer request in," said Rooney. "He's gone back and proven that I didn't. Rooney's statement is a boost for Moyes, whose relationship with the striker has endured some difficult moments. Moyes was the manager at Everton when Rooney was sold to Manchester United in 2004 for Â£25m and sued Rooney after objecting to striker's account of the sale in his autobiography, Wayne Rooney - My Story So Far. Rooney was forced to make a formal apology and pay damages after Moyes won his case in 2008. The pair were also at loggerheads when Rooney claimed he was "angered and confused" by suggestions in the summer by Moyes that he was viewed as back-up to Robin van Persie at United. United have seven points from three Group A games in the Champions League after victory over Real Sociedad. Rooney said: "I thought we played some great football. We should have won the game by three, four or five, but I'm happy we got the win, that's most important thing. "We defended well, a clean sheet is always pleasing. We created a lot of chances and on another day we will take them and win the game more comfortably." Asked if he felt he was in his prime on the eve of his 28th birthday, he responded: "I do, I feel good, feel fit." </body>

      <description>Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish wants to talk to former Stoke boss Tony Pulis after the departure of Ian Holloway.</description>

      <body>Crystal Palace will approach former Stoke City boss Tony Pulis as they seek Ian Holloway's successor as manager, according to chairman Steve Parish. Holloway, 50, left the Eagles by mutual consent on Wednesday, with the club 19th in the Premier League table. Pulis, 55, established Stoke in the top flight before leaving in May - and Parish wants to appoint a manager with experience at that level. "He's never been relegated and he's out of work. We'll look," he said. Pulis was appointed Stoke boss for a second time in 2006 and two years later guided them into the top flight after a 23-year absence. Despite not finishing lower than 14th in five seasons in the Premier League, the Welshman left by mutual consent in the summer after being told the club felt the time was right for him to leave. Stoke's direct and physical style of football often drew criticism from other supporters and managers, but Parish said the Eagles, who play Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday, would approach Pulis about the vacancy at Selhurst Park. "I'm sure we'll try and contact him and if he's interested we'll have a chat with him and see where we go," he told talkSPORT.Â  "But I don't want to put pressure on anybody. We've started making a list, we'll throw everybody into that and see who we want to see." If Pulis does take charge at Palace, he will replace a man the south London club did not want to lose. "I was more than happy to get relegated and come back up with Ian," Parish said. "The word 'sacked' has never been mentioned among the directors. "I've spent three days trying to get Ian in the frame of mind that he can do it against Arsenal. "You'd love to have someone in place next week but I haven't got a list. I wanted Ian to wake up and say 'sorry about the blip' and stay." Holloway guided Palace to the Premier League via the play-offs last season after joining in November, and signed 16 players in the summer. But the only points his squad were able to gain in eight league matches this term came in the 3-1 victory against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 31 August. "All I can do is be as honest as I can and wish everyone at the club well," the former Blackpool manager said. "I need a little bit of time to chill out with the family, but I will look out for Palace's scores." </body>

      <body>Former England and Great Britain captain Jamie Peacock will be part of the BBC Sport team covering the Rugby League World Cup. In the first of a series of columns, he gives an insight into life as an international player and looks ahead to England's opening match. How much did playing for my country mean to me? Put it this way, this time last year I deliberately booked a family holiday that coincided with England's opening fixture in the World Cup. I retired from internationals in the summer of 2012, but as I watched England beat Wales and France later that year I felt a pull so strong it was painful. I knew that booking a holiday would create another barrier against the temptation to come out of international retirement. Even so, during the past Super League season, I often thought about the World Cup. I asked my wife Faye if she would mind if I competed. I also had discussions with England coach Steve McNamara as well as my Leeds team-mate - and England captain - Kevin Sinfield. However, in the final weeks of the Super League season, it was obvious my busted, 35-year-old body would not be able to rise again. It might have been different if my dad was still here and wanted me to pull on the shirt one last time. He lost his long battle against cancer the morning after we played Wigan on 5 September. But do not for a minute think that I am not massively excited about this World Cup. Its coverage on the BBC will give our great game some massive exposure and hopefully the competition will have a huge lift-off when England play Australia in this Saturday's opening-day fixture in Cardiff. Frankly, I have never really understood the decision to play such an important fixture, one that could set the tone for the tournament, at the Millennium Stadium - a venue so far away from the game's traditional heartlands. It is a definite gamble. I think the competition can ride off the back of the Olympic legacy. People are more willing now to take a look at different sports and I'm convinced new people to the game will see England do well against Australia. England cannot control how many people watch their opening game, but they can have a real impact on the sort of spectacle that takes place. I would not read too much into the shock 15-14 defeat against Italy in Salford last Saturday. If anything, the England team will now be even more motivated to show how good they are. Having said that, there is no doubt self-belief is critical for England's players. If they don't believe they can defeat the Aussies, they might as well not bother turning up. Former Australia hooker Danny Buderus was a team-mate of mine at Leeds and told me they always thought GB and England's biggest problem was a lack of belief. Sometimes, it felt to me like half of us believed and the other half weren't so sure - and the Kangaroos probably grew an extra leg off the back of that. Sure, Australia are big favourites to win the competition, but don't think they won't be scared. They lost the final in 2008 and the pressure to win the trophy back is enormous. At times, that pressure can be fatal. Sometimes, they are made out to be superhuman, but I've played against them loads of times and I've seen the fear in their eyes. I've looked at players and seen the anxiety of a someone who does not think he is good enough to be out there. Whoever you are, you've got to have the courage to act in the face of fear. When I started at international level, I asked myself what I was good at, what I'd done to earn the call-up. I told myself that when I went out there I was going to play tough and tackle anything that moved. I made sure when I carried the ball, it was hard, direct and into the heart of their pack. The England boys have also got to realise the crowd will lift them. Some time ago, I was asked to speak to the England rugby union team. Kevin Sinfield also attended, as did former England cricket captain Andrew Strauss and Toni Minichiello, the coach of Olympic heptathlon champion Jess Ennis. Minichiello talked about how Ennis was really feeling the pressure before the London Olympics and trying too hard. He told her to let the crowd be her plus-one, the extra edge she needed. I always thought that made a lot of sense: Go out there, do your stuff and let the crowd help you. There is a sense of the unknown about Saturday because England and Australia have not met for two years. On paper, the Kangaroos have the better squad but England have home advantage and go into the tournament with all their crucial players fit. McNamara has also done a great job of instilling a sense of ownership, pride and identity in the England shirt. Back in 2000, the squad lacked experience, but there are plenty of top Super League players this time as well as a few who are at the very top in the Australian NRL. The three Burgess brothers, James Graham, Gareth Widdop - these guys are big stars down under and a real asset for England. Back in 2002, I was a member of the Great Britain side humiliated 64-10 by Australia in Sydney. It was a one-off Test and the preparation was terrible. Back then, I was young and naive. When I woke up the following day and saw headlines that talked about the "death of rugby league", I thought I had contributed to that process. But if that was an incredible low, then my high point as an international player also came against Australia. I was captain of the GB team that defeated Australia 23-12 in Sydney in 2006, our first win in that city since 1988. It was a brutal game - Aussie prop Willie Mason floored Stuart Fielden before Mason and I got involved with each other. Towards the end, I was exhausted and miles behind play as we broke away to score the decisive try through Gareth Raynor. It was a cinematic moment as I watched the move unfold in front of me. All of our boys jumped up in realisation of victory as, simultaneously, the Aussie heads fell. The only rugby league shirt that hangs in my house is the one I wore that night - and the England players can create memories like that on Saturday. To win, every Englishman must have a nine out of 10 game. In a Super League fixture, even against a top team, a side can carry two of three players. Not against Australia. They have the support of the nation. They now must conquer the fear and the hurt. They must have the belief. Most of all, they cannot afford to dip their toe into the tournament. They must dive straight in. Jamie Peacock was talking to BBC Sport's Paul Fletcher. </body>

      <body>Thousands of people in Greater Manchester have been queuing to get a chance of a signed copy of Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography. The former Manchester United manager's book signing has started at a Tesco supermarket not far from the club's Old Trafford stadium. Some fans queued since Wednesday's European Champions League tie against Real Sociedad. Ferguson, 71, stepped down as Reds boss after more than 26 years in May. Fans have travelled from the Far East, the Middle East and all over the UK to the book signing. Wearing a dark blue suit, Sir Alex arrived uttering a simple "hello" before settling into his seat to greet his fans. He managed United to 13 Premier League titles, two Champions League successes, five FA Cup wins and four League Cup triumphs. On Wednesday, he rewarded one woman, who had began queuing on Tuesday, by calling to see her at 18:30 BST with a signed copy of his book so she could go back home to Wales. </body>

      <body>A man who repeatedly raped a nine-year-old girl has been jailed for five years and four months. Paul Barrett, 44, from Inverness, abused the child at an address in Cannich in the Highlands between 1 April 2012 and 17 February this year. The High Court in Edinburgh heard how Barrett forced the child to participate in sexual acts with him. He pleaded guilty to a rape charge at the High Court last month. Sentence had been deferred for reports. Defence advocate Shahid Latif told the court that Barrett was sorry for his conduct and had fully co-operated with the police and prosecutors. Mr Latif added: "Nothing can be said to justify or mitigate a crime of this nature. "Mr Barrett is an individual who has realised the devastation of what he has done." Passing sentence Lord Pentland described Barrett as "cruel, devious and manipulative". He added: "Society has a complete abhorrence towards crimes of this nature and it is the responsibility of the courts to reflect that and to deter others who may be persuaded to commit crimes of this type." </body>

      <body>A 24-year-old man from Arnol on Lewis has been accused of operating a slaughterhouse in a barn on his family's croft as a business. Norman Campbell is charged with breaking food hygiene regulations. Stornoway Sheriff Court heard that the Scottish SPCA, acting on a tip-off, found 32 carcasses and 77 sheep heads at the property in November 2011. Mr Campbell denies running a slaughtering business and maintains the meat was for his family's consumption. He has pleaded not guilty to seven charges. Four of the charges are under the food hygiene act and three under the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies regulations. Colm Fraser, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's head of environmental health, told the court he was convinced that such a volume of meat could not be for personal consumption. He added that the premises was a long way from being compliant with food safety regulations. The trial continues. </body>

      <title>RUC and UDR men 'in murder gang'</title>
      <description>A new book claims members of the RUC and UDR were part of a loyalist gang that killed more than 100 people in the 1970s.</description>

      <body>A new book claims members of the RUC and UDR were part of a loyalist gang that killed more than 100 people in the 1970s. The book claims to have uncovered evidence of collusion on a huge scale. It says the loyalist gang operated from farms in counties Armagh and Tyrone. One extract, from an unpublished HET report, says there was "indisputable evidence of security forces collusion" that should have rung alarm bells all the way to the top of government. Lethal Allies - British Collusion in Ireland contains other extracts of unpublished reports by the Historical Enquiries Team (HET) that refer to evidence of widespread collusion. The book is written by a researcher with the Pat Finucane Centre, a human rights advocacy and lobbying group in Northern Ireland. It is published on Thursday. The author, Anne Cadwallader, claims RUC officers and members of the UDR were part of a gang operating from two farms in south Armagh and Tyrone that killed 120 people between 1972 and 1976. "It can be demonstrated beyond a reasonable doubt that there was systemic collusion in these cases," she said. Allegations of collusion between members of the security forces and loyalist paramilitaries are nothing new. The BBC Spotlight programme investigated allegations about the existence of the gang nine years ago. At the time, two former RUC officers admitted they had been members of the gang. One of them was William McCaughey, who has since died. He was convicted of the murder of a Catholic shopkeeper and the kidnapping of a Catholic priest. He told BBC Spotlight he had been a member of the UVF while serving as a police officer and explained how it operated. "There was horses for courses obviously," he said. "There was people who were drivers, there was people who were able to take people's lives, shoot people. There was people who simply operated on an intelligence level, not every person involved was actually involved in the taking of life directly. "I was quite happy to co-operate at any level with any person who had a basic loyalty to Northern Ireland, who shared the same belief system, the same ideological system as myself." The book claims the loyalist gang operated from farms in Glennane in south Armagh, and Dungannon, County Tyrone, and that the security forces were aware of their activities. An extract, referring to the killings of four people in attacks on two pubs in Charlemont, County Armagh, on a night in May 1976, says: "It is difficult to believe... when judged in concert with other cases emerging at the time, that such widespread evidence of collusion in these areas was not a significant concern at the highest levels of the security forces and of government." Another HET report also claims that the RUC had advance knowledge of an attack in which two people died in August 1976. The book claims that days before the attack on the Three Steps Inn in Keady, County Armagh, the RUC knew a bomb was being stored at a farmhouse owned by a serving police officer and asked the army to put it under surveillance. According to the book, the surveillance operation was ended and the bomb was then used in the attack. It also claims that RUC Special Branch knew the identities of four people involved in the bombing, but that no arrests were made. The families of the two victims, 38-year-old Elizabeth McDonald and Gerard McGleenan, 22, have lodged complaints with the Police Ombudsman. </body>

      <body>Police have said a pipe bomb found during a security alert in County Antrim was designed to kill police officers. Police received a call around 22:00 BST on Wednesday to say a device had been thrown at a patrol in Mill Road, Newtownabbey. A number of homes were evacuated after midnight. Two suspicious objects were found during a search. One of the objects was a hoax while the second was a viable device. Residents were allowed to return to their homes just before 05:00 BST on Thursday. Ch Insp Stephen Reid, area commander of Newtownabbey and Carrickfergus said: "This device was clearly designed to kill police officers and we are very fortunate no-one was killed or injured. Had it exploded it could have killed or maimed anyone close by, police officers or local people alike. "Those responsible showed total disregard for the local community and put the lives of local people in the area at risk. "I would like to thank to local residents for their patience and support throughout this operation and I want to reassure them that we will not be deterred by this attack." </body>

      <title>Firms still failing over 'swaps'</title>
      <description>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after being mis-sold financial products, claims an MP.</description>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people plan to attend a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed Â£180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <title>Kenya journalists warned on Westgate</title>
      <description>Kenya's police chief warns journalists over their coverage of last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre, following reports of looting by soldiers.</description>

      <body>Kenya's police chief has warned journalists over their coverage of last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre, following reports of looting by soldiers. David Kimaiyo said reporters should not "provoke propaganda" or "incite Kenyans" in their coverage. CCTV footage has been leaked on local media which appears to show soldiers taking items from a supermarket. The army has said the soldiers were only taking water during the siege. At least 67 people, including six members of the security forces, were killed after Islamist militants stormed one of Nairobi's biggest shopping centres, staying there for four days. Somalia's al-Shabab group has said it was behind the attack. As well as the looting, local media have also reported that some members of the security forces were killed by friendly fire during the siege, raising concerns about the command structure. Mr Kimaiyo said two investigative journalists from KTN, a private Kenyan television station operated by the Standard Group, were among those threatened with arrest. "We are looking within the law very closely for those individuals who in one way or another might have committed crimes," the police chief told journalists in the capital, Nairobi, on Wednesday. They would soon "be apprehended and appear before the court, and face the consequences of this", he said. Mr Kimaiyo said that journalists should not "issue statements that can amount to hate speech" or statements that "could affect the life of another person". Atul Shah, the head of Nakumatt, the supermarket which was allegedly looted, was summoned by police investigating how the CCTV footage had appeared in local media, Kenya's Standard newspaper reports. Regarding concerns over which security agency was in command of the rescue operation at Westgate, Mr Kimaiyo said that as head of the police, he had been consulted. "It was a joint effort, and we clearly agreed on how to conduct it," Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper quotes him as saying. During the press conference he also said that police were now holding eight suspects who would soon be charged in court. He did not give their names or explain their alleged role in the attack. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants, who are all believed to have died by the end of the siege. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the four attackers is suspected of being a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. </body>

      <body>Two UN peacekeepers from Chad have been killed and six others wounded - some "severely" - in a suicide attack in northern Mali, the UN has said. Civilians also died when a bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle to the checkpoint in Tessalit before blowing himself up, the statement said. One child was killed and another injured, Reuters quoted Mali government officials as saying. The UN has nearly 6,000 troops in Mali to tackle militant Islamists. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the attack "will not affect the determination of the United Nations to support the restoration of security, stability and lasting peace in Mali". The UN Security Council condemned the attack "in the strongest terms". It expressed condolences to the families of the peacekeepers killed, as well as to the governments of Mali and Chad. The Security Council said those responsible would be held accountable and it called Mali "to swiftly investigate... and bring the perpetrators to justice". Mali's defence ministry said four bombers took part in the raid and all died, Reuters reported. The UN's special representative to Mali, Bert Koenders, earlier this month called for more troops to be deployed following an upsurge in bombings and rocket attacks. French troops captured northern Mali's key cities and towns from the militants after launching an operation to oust them in January. It handed security responsibility to the UN force in July. The force, known as Minusma, has less than half of its mandated strength of more than 12,000 military personnel. </body>

      <title>Pakistan 'endorsed US drone strikes'</title>
      <description>Secret US documents show senior Pakistani government officials have known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes for years, a US paper reveals.</description>

      <body>Secret US documents reveal that senior Pakistani government officials have for years known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes, an American newspaper reports. The Washington Post obtained CIA documents and Pakistani diplomatic memos which indicate officials were routinely given classified briefings. Analysts have long suspected Pakistan gave tacit consent for such strikes despite publicly condemning them. Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif has urged US President Obama to halt such attacks. "I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes," Mr Sharif said after they met on Wednesday. The attacks by unmanned US aircraft have been a critical source of tension in the relationship between the countries and came up amid wide-ranging talks between the leaders in Washington. They are also deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public and Pakistan has consistently stated that they violate its sovereignty. The Pakistani government is yet to comment on the report. The documents obtained by the newspaper focus on at least 65 drone strikes in Pakistan over the last few years and were labelled as "talking points" for regular CIA briefings. Although they are marked "top secret", they are cleared for release to Pakistan, the paper reports. The Washington Post says the documents provide a detailed timeline of the CIA drone programme "tracing its evolution from a campaign aimed at a relatively short list of senior al-Qaeda operatives into a broader aerial assault against militant groups with no connection to the 11 September 2001 attacks". A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper and the CIA also declined to comment. Correspondents say the files expose the explicit nature of the arrangement between the countries in the period when neither acknowledged that any drone programme even existed. In 2010 the controversial whistle-blowing site Wikileaks released numerous documents relating to Pakistan which showed the Pakistani military and other arms of the government had "quietly acquiesced" with drone strikes even though they publicly condemned them. In August 2008 then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is reported to have said: "I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it." But this latest cache includes documents which appear to refer to a direct Pakistani role in the selection of targets, with the newspaper referring to one 2010 entry describing hitting a location "at the request of your government". There is also a reference to a "network of locations associated with a joint CIA-ISI targeting effort". The number of civilian casualties in these drone strikes has long been a source of dispute. Local claims of civilian deaths are almost impossible to prove. One reason is the restricted media access in the region. The other is the militants' tendency to cordon off the targeted sites and conduct quick burials. Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report which said that CIA drone attacks in Pakistan are responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes. The rights group named several victims who, it says, "posed no threat to life". Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in the volatile tribal region of North Waziristan where many strikes have hit, and found a number of victims had been unarmed. The US has defended its drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. On Tuesday the White House said it takes "extraordinary care" to ensure they comply with international law and that they were a "course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life". A recent UN report also found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. Estimates by other groups such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism calculate that between 407 and 926 civilians were killed in Pakistan. The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that the general impression one gets from talking to elders and correspondents from the tribal area is that drone strikes are for the most part accurate, causing fewer civilian casualties than some reports suggest. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago, when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-west Pakistan, without giving the Pakistani government advance warning. But in their meeting on Wednesday, Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan "have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security". </body>

      <body>Six months after a major clothing factory collapse in Bangladesh, 94% of the victims are still awaiting compensation, a charity says. The charity, Action Aid, says many survivors have serious injuries that have prevented them returning to work. More than 1,130 people died when the Rana Plaza building near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, collapsed in April. Action Aid, questioned nearly two-thirds of survivors and victims' relatives for its survey. It found that 94% of those questioned said they had received no legal benefits from their employers, including sick pay or compensation. It also found that 92% of survivors had not gone back to work, with 63% of those reporting physical injuries including amputations, paralysis and severe pain. Of those surveyed, 92% said they were deeply traumatised. Until now, Primark is the only company that has provided financial support to victims - about Â£118 ($191) each to 3,300 people, according to Action Aid. The company has said it will continue to pay wages to those affected for three more months. The Action Aid survey found that survivors of the Rana Plaza disaster were facing severe financial difficulty. More than half said they had mounting debts, and more than 90% said they had no savings. Retailers in the EU and the US have pledged since April to improve working conditions in factories they use in Bangladesh, but negotiations between trade unions and retailers over long-term compensation have yet to produce a deal. On Tuesday, the Bangladeshi government and the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched a further initiative to improve the safety of buildings and prevent fires in the clothing industry. The $24m (Â£15m), three-and-a-half-year plan is to be funded by the British and Dutch governments. The ILO has been tasked with bringing together numerous measures aimed at improving working conditions, the BBC's Mahfuz Sadique reports from Dhaka. But he says that a fire at a textile plant earlier this month has highlighted once more the dangers still faced by workers. Bangladesh is reported to be the world's second largest exporter of ready-made clothes behind China. Latest government figures put the annual value of those exports at $21.5bn. The Rana Plaza collapse was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history. </body>

      <title>EU to hold summit amid US spying row</title>
      <description>EU leaders are due to hold a summit in Brussels with fresh allegations of US spying threatening to overshadow talks.</description>

      <body>An EU summit is due to begin in Brussels with fresh allegations of US spying threatening to overshadow talks on the economy and migration. Leaders want to try to consolidate Europe's fragile economic recovery, and speed implementation of a single market in digital services. British PM David Cameron will also call on the EU to cut red tape on business. But new allegations of US eavesdropping on Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel may also be discussed. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin to explain, after claims arose in the German media that her mobile phone calls had been bugged. France's President Francois Hollande is pressing for the issue to be put on the summit agenda, following reports that millions of French calls have been monitored. The veteran French EU Commissioner Michel Barnier told the BBC that "enough is enough", and confidence in the US had been shaken. Mr Barnier, the commissioner for internal market and services, said Europe must not be naive but develop its own strategic digital tools, such as a "European data cloud" independent of American oversight. The digital economy is on the official summit agenda for Thursday evening. One of the key initiatives of the European Commission is its Digital Agenda for Europe, which it says "aims to reboot Europe's economy and help Europe's citizens and businesses to get the most out of digital technologies". Council officials say investment in the digital economy is vital to boost growth, which is creeping back to the European economy. They want to address market fragmentation and a perceived shortage in IT skills. They may also discuss telecoms reform, data protection and a cap on credit card payments. With markets becalmed, Spain coming out of recession and Ireland soon to exit its bailout programme, there are signs of progress for Europe's leaders to celebrate, says the BBC's Gavin Hewitt in Brussels. But they recognise that the recovery is fragile and solid growth is needed. Mr Cameron is likely to use the economic discussion to raise what Britain sees as a proliferation of red tape. He said last week: "All too often EU rules are a handicap for firms," and that small business owners "are forced to spend too much time complying with pointless, burdensome and costly regulations". The European Commission - which makes the rules - has recognised that it may have gone too far in some places. President Jose Manuel Barroso says he wants the EU to be "big on big things and smaller on smaller things". He says the Commission has cut more than 5,000 legal acts in the past five years and wants to do more. On Friday the leaders will discuss relations with central European countries, ahead of a November summit in Lithuania, where new agreements will be signed. Migration will also be discussed, following the loss of hundreds of lives among migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. The Commission has called on EU countries to offer "additional and urgent contributions" to prevent further tragedies at sea. It wants greater resources to survey and patrol sea routes, but also a more co-ordinated approach to dealing with migrants. Countries in the Mediterranean deal with sudden and unmanageable mass arrivals, but the countries which approve most asylum requests are Germany, France and Sweden. The Commission wants a more even resettlement of refugees. EU sources say the leaders are likely to promise improved co-operation, but not more money or resources. They say they first want a new surveillance system, Eurosur, to come into force, to see what effect it has. </body>

      <body>Tens of thousands of people have taken part in rival rallies in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to mark the anniversary of the 1956 uprising against the Soviet Union. Although many took to the streets to remember the victims, events were dominated by party politics. Conservative PM Viktor Orban likened his opponents to those who betrayed the uprising, while an opposition rally called for Mr Orban to be removed. Hungary is to hold elections next year. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Hungary said the largest crowd gathered at Heroes Square to listened to Mr Orban rail against "domestic traitors" and "foreign speculators". Mr Orban compared opposition parties with those who betrayed the revolution 57 years ago, and likened Soviet troops to foreign banks and speculators today. At another demonstration on the banks of the Danube, about 20,000 people heard an array of leftist and liberal party leaders call for the ousting of Mr Orban's government. Meanwhile, in the city centre the far-right Jobbik party lambasted both the government and other opposition parties. Our correspondent says many people tried to ignore the party-political events and remember the victims of the uprising - those who fell on the barricades or were executed or imprisoned after it was crushed. The events of 1956 became a lasting symbol of the Cold War. Hungary declared 23 October a national holiday after democracy was restored in Hungary in 1990. Mr Orban has been able to push through changes to Hungary's constitution because of the two-thirds majority his Fidesz party and its allies enjoy in parliament following the 2010 election. However, critics have accused him of eroding democratic rights. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <body>Clowns gathered at a convention in Mexico City have denied any of their colleagues were behind the killing of a former drug cartel leader last Friday. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. Gunmen dressed as clowns opened fire on the former leading member of the once-powerful and violent Tijuana cartel, authorities say. Around 500 clowns at the convention held a "laugh-a-ton" rally for peace. A clown leader said if a real member of the profession had been involved in the shooting, they would have been easily identifiable by their costumes, masks and painting. "The people who do that, they're not clowns. I can swear on my mother's grave it wasn't a clown," Tomas Morales, whose stage name is Clown Llantom, told Associated Press news agency. They say clowns are frequently victims of robberies and their costumes and masks are then used to commit other crimes. The attack against Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

      <title>Syria hit by blackouts after blast</title>
      <description>An explosion near the airport in Syria's capital, Damascus, is followed by blackouts in the city and across the country.</description>

      <body>Large parts of Syria have been hit by a power cut following an explosion near the airport in the capital, Damascus. The lights went out after rebel artillery reportedly hit a gas pipeline that supplies a power station. Residents say the entire capital has been plunged into darkness and officials said the power cuts had been nationwide. Many parts of Syria have suffered sporadic power cuts since the start of the country's civil war. "A terrorist attack on a gas pipeline that feeds a power station in the south has led to a power outage in the provinces, and work to repair it is in progress," Syria's state news agency Sana quoted Electricity Minister Imad Khamis as saying. He said it could take up to 48 hours to restore supplies. President Bashar al-Assad has frequently referred to his opponents as foreign-backed "terrorists". UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said rebel shelling had been aimed at the town of Ghasula, around 2km (1.2 miles) from the airport. "It is likely this was a large-scale operation planned well in advance," Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Activists say a huge fire was seen blazing near the airport. It is unclear whether anyone was hurt. Meanwhile the SOHR says a car bomb has hit a military checkpoint in a western suburb of Damascus, causing multiple casualties among security forces. In another development, the body tasked with destroying Syria's chemical arsenal has said that Damascus is due to hand over its disarmament plan on Thursday. In a press conference on Wednesday, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it expected Syria's initial declaration within the next 24 hours. The OPCW and the UN have had a team of 60 experts and support staff in Syria since 1 October. They have said that the Syrian government has been co-operating with the watchdog's work. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August. </body>

      <description>At least 19 policemen and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 19 police officers and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say. The first saw a suicide bomber ram an explosives-filled car into a checkpoint in Rutba, 110km (70 miles) from the Syrian border, killing five policemen. Another bomber blew up his vehicle near police deployed at a bypass, killing four officers and three lorry drivers. Attacks by gunmen elsewhere in Anbar left seven other officers dead. They opened fire on several checkpoints west of Ramadi, along the main road that links the capital Baghdad to Jordan and Syria. Further attacks on Wednesday in and around Baghdad killed at least seven people and wounded about 20 others. Officials said two of those killed were policeman who were shot while going to work. They said one bomb exploded during the morning rush hour in a commercial street in the city's Amariya district. Another bomb went off at an outdoor market in the Abu Ghraib area, to the west. In the market town of Madain, south of Baghdad, a bomb killed at least four people and wounded at least nine others. Elsewhere, a gunman shot dead six people people in the northern city of Mosul, according to the AFP news agency. There has been a surge in sectarian violence across Iraq this year not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. The UN says 979 people - including 127 police and 92 military personnel - were killed in violent attacks in September, bringing the number killed this year to 5,740. The unrest was sparked by an army raid on a Sunni Arab anti-government protest camp in April. The protesters were calling for the resignation of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and denouncing the authorities for allegedly targeting the minority Sunni community. Iraq has also seen a spill-over of violence from the conflict in Syria, where jihadist rebels linked to the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda, have risen to prominence. In the past two months, Iraqi security forces have reportedly arrested hundreds of alleged al-Qaeda members in and around Baghdad as part of a campaign the government is calling "Revenge for the Martyrs". But the operations, which have taken place mostly in Sunni districts, have angered the Sunni community and failed to halt the violence. </body>

      <title>Sharif urges Obama to end drone hits</title>
      <description>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif tells President Obama drone strikes there must cease, while the leaders pledge to strengthen the nations' strained ties.</description>

      <body>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif has told President Obama the US should halt drone strikes in Pakistan, a critical source of tension in the relationship. The two leaders held wide-ranging talks at the White House on Wednesday, pledging to strengthen the often-strained ties between the nations. The leaders also discussed tension between Pakistan and India over the disputed Kashmir region. Mr Obama said the US and Pakistan remained important strategic partners. The talks in the Oval Office came just hours after India accused Pakistani troops of firing guns and mortars at several dozen Indian border posts in Kashmir. One Indian guard was killed and six others injured, according to media reports. Mr Obama did not address the incident in remarks after their meeting, but praised Mr Sharif for "taking a very wise path in exploring how decades of tension between India and Pakistan can be reduced". "Billions of dollars have been spent on an arms race in response to these tensions, and those resources could be much more profitably invested in education, social welfare programmes on both sides of the border," he said. "[That] would be good for the entire subcontinent - and good for the world." Mr Sharif spoke of his commitment to building a "co-operative relationship with India, and our efforts to peacefully resolve all our outstanding issues, including Kashmir". Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago, when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-eastern Pakistan without giving the Pakistani government advance warning. Their ties were further tested by the killing of 24 Pakistani troops in a US air strike along the Afghan border later in 2011. Following the meeting, Mr Obama acknowledged that tensions and misunderstandings would persist between the two nations. "It's a challenge. It's not easy," he said. "We are committed to working together and making sure that rather than this being a source of tension between our two countries, it can be a source of strength." And he pledged co-operation in "ways that respect Pakistan's sovereignty, that respect the concerns of both countries". Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan "have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security". "Our two countries are bound by a common commitment to the cherished values of democracy," he said. Mr Sharif said the two had agreed to strengthen co-operation on counterterrorism. "I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes," he said. He stated his top domestic priorities were the economy, energy, education and combating extremist activity. "We both agreed that progress in these core areas is indispensable for creating new opportunities and building a hopeful future for our next generation," Mr Sharif said. Mr Obama said both leaders had agreed on the importance of leaving Pakistan's neighbour Afghanistan "stable and secure" as US and coalition forces prepare to withdraw next year. The White House said a peaceful Pakistan-Afghanistan border was critical to a successful counterterrorism and counterinsurgency effort. Both leaders "expressed satisfaction with the positive momentum achieved in defence relations", the White House later said in a statement. They also pledged to abide by the commitments of the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Korea, emphasising that nuclear terrorism was "one of the most challenging threats to international security," the White House said. </body>

      <title>Democrats lament 'Obamacare' flaws</title>
      <description>President Barack Obama's Democratic allies voice their frustration with widespread problems with aspects of his signature healthcare law.</description>

      <body>President Barack Obama's Democratic allies have begun voicing frustration with widespread problems with aspects of his signature healthcare law. House Democrats have complained that technical issues with the insurance enrolment websites had overshadowed the law's current and future benefits. Some demanded Mr Obama find and sack those responsible for the glitches. Mr Obama has said technical problems with the site are "unacceptable" and pledges they will soon be fixed. He assured Americans on Monday that technical experts from both inside and outside the government were working around the clock to fix the website and its underpinnings. The health law, known formally as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and informally as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 and is Mr Obama's foremost domestic policy initiative. Among its central provisions are an expansion of the Medicaid public health programme for poor people, a requirement that Americans who do not have insurance from their employers or the government buy it on their own - with subsidies to aid the purchase, and a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. Mr Obama and the law's supporters say it will eventually reshape America's costly and inefficient healthcare system and provide insurance to most of the estimated 46 million Americans who lack it. At issue currently are websites run by the federal government and some states that serve as online marketplaces where individuals can compare private insurance plans, learn about available public subsidies, and sign up for a plan. The sites, known as exchanges, opened on 1 October. The White House aims to enrol as many as seven million people through the exchanges by the 31 March end of the enrolment period. The central site run by the federal government, healthcare.gov, has been plagued with problems, notably extremely long wait times. Websites run by individual states have not performed as poorly. The Republicans, who have opposed the law from the beginning and have sought to undermine it at every turn, are now calling for the rollout to be delayed and for deadlines for enrolment to be pushed back. The Republicans have also loudly demanded an investigation into the exchanges' shortcomings. "It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable," House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday. In light of the technical difficulties, some Democrats have also said Mr Obama should consider extending the enrolment period beyond 31 March. But House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi advised against that. "I think we should try to fix what we have, move forward with the deadline we have," she said. "What we want to do is fix it and go forward with it, not make policies that are predicated on its not working." Complaints from Mr Obama's fellow Democrats are a relatively new part of the debate. Democratic members of the House of Representatives left a briefing provided by the administration on Wednesday saying they had resolved not to let the problems with one part of the rollout overwhelm the law's benefits. "The president needs to man up, find out who was responsible, and fire them," Minnesota Congressman Richard Nolan said. "You don't get many second chances to get a good first impression." The White House has sought to reassure political allies and Americans at large that the government is working to resolve the issues. The Obama administration has launched what senior officials called a "tech surge", with senior economic aide Jeffrey Zients tasked with analysing and repairing the problems. On Wednesday, executives from top health insurance companies agreed to form technical teams to help the Obama administration fix the website and the systems underlying it. "We are collaborating closely with the insurers to address problems we have witnessed," the White House said in a statement, after executives from 14 insurance companies met Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other senior administration officials. </body>

      <body>The BBC has spoken to people in Sri Lanka who say they have been threatened with rape and tortured at the hands of officials. The group Human Rights Watch says rape and sexual violence are widely used against detainees, something the government denies.

      <body>In today's celebrity-obsessed world, most images of stars tend to be contrived, taken in controlled environments. The paparazzi would love the access Don Hunstein enjoyed for decades. From 1955-86 he worked as Columbia Records' in-house photographer, capturing countless moments of musicians in private and with their guard down. Keeping Time is a trove of mostly unseen and intimate black and white images of jazz, rock, soul, and classical greats who recorded on the Columbia label. Jon Pareles, the chief popular-music critic for the New York Times, contributed to the book. He spoke to the BBC about Hunstein's keen eye for a shot and ability to put his famous subjects at ease.

      <title>Coffee v smoothies: Which is better for you?</title>
      <description>Which drink is better for your health?</description>

      <body>One is made of fruit. The other is caffeinated. So a smoothie is a healthier option than a coffee, right? Don't be so sure, says Michael Mosley, as he weighs the evidence. Which is healthier - coffee or smoothies? It seems obvious that the answer must be a smoothie. After all, drinking coffee is a necessary evil while having a smoothie, made from fruit, is part of your five-a-day. But when you look into the scientific studies they reveal something much more surprising. Let's start with coffee. There have been numerous claims down the years that drinking coffee will increase your risk of a whole range of terrible things from heart disease to cancer. These claims have been largely based on case control studies, where you take a group of people who drink coffee and compare them with another matched group who don't. The problem with this approach is that coffee drinkers are more likely than non-coffee drinkers to have other "bad" habits, like drinking alcohol or smoking, so it is hard to tease apart what is really doing the harm. A more reliable way to get at the truth is to do what is called a prospective cohort study. You take a group of disease-free individuals, collect data about them, then follow them for a large number of years to see what happens. When scientists collected data on the coffee drinking habits of 130,000 men and women and then followed them for over 20 years they found that coffee is rather a good thing (The Relationship of Coffee Consumption with Mortality, Annals of Internal Medicine, June 2008). They crunched the numbers and concluded that "regular coffee consumption was not associated with an increased mortality rate in either men or women". In fact, data from this study suggests that moderate coffee consumption is mildly protective, leading to slightly lower all-cause mortality in coffee drinkers than non-coffee drinkers. Based on this and other studies the most effective "dose" is two to five cups a day. More than that and any benefits drop off. There are hundreds of different substances in coffee, including many different flavonoids (compounds widely found in plants that have antioxidant effects). Which of these ingredients is beneficial, we simply don't know. When it comes to the brain, however, the answer seems to be "caffeine". In research recently published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry (July 2013) they found that people who drank two to four cups of caffeinated coffee a day were half as likely to commit suicide as those who either drank decaff or fewer than two cups a day. This research pulled together data from three studies that had followed more than 200,000 people for more than 14 years, so it's pretty reliable. It is also supported by a number of other studies, which makes this claim even more plausible. One reason why caffeine may be a mild anti-depressant is that as well as making you more alert, it increases levels of neurotransmitters in the brain, like dopamine and serotonin, that are known to improve mood. The researchers don't recommend going overboard, noting that "there is little further benefit for consumption above two to three cups". One note of caution is that these trials began many years ago so the sort of coffee consumption being tested is almost certainly good, old-fashioned coffee. A simple mug of coffee delivers somewhere between zero and 60 calories, depending on whether it is black, white or white with one sugar. Cappuccinos, lattes and mochas contain coffee but they also contain a lot of calories - anything between 100 and 600 - so when it comes to fancy coffees I limit myself to the occasional tall, skinny cappuccino (70 calories). But what about fruit smoothies? They may consist of pure fruit but by the time you've got rid of the peel and mashed the fibre then you have already lost many of the potential health benefits. What you are mainly left with is a sugary drink. In a survey published in early 2013, researchers found that out of 52 commercial smoothies, 41 had more sugar than Coca-Cola (a 12oz can contains the equivalent of about nine teaspoons), and all had more calories. Fruit smoothies are acidic and the bits cling to your teeth, so dentists are not enthusiastic. An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but not when it's been peeled, blended, mashed and packaged. In a study published in August 2013 in the British Medical Journal (Fruit Consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes) they found that while eating fruit cuts your risk of developing diabetes, drinking it appears to increase the risk. This was another big study involving lots of people followed for many years. An interesting finding was that different fruits gave different levels of benefit. Three servings of blueberries, for example, cut the risk of diabetes by 26%, while eating apples, pears, bananas and grapefruits also had a positive, albeit much smaller, effect. Overall those who ate fruit cut their risk of developing diabetes by 2%, while those who drank it (more than three glasses of fruit juice a week) increased their risk by 8%. More bad news for fruit juice drinkers comes from a case-controlled study done in Western Australia that examined the daily diets of more than 2,000 people. They found that eating some types of fruit and vegetables (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower and apples) cuts your risk of colorectal cancer, while drinking fruit juice was associated with an increased risk of rectal cancer. Sugary drinks lead to raised levels of the hormone insulin and persistently high levels of insulin are associated with increased risk of some cancers. The researchers point out that many things that protect against bowel cancer, such as antioxidants and fibre, are lost or diminished during the juicing process. None of these studies specifically looked at the health benefits or otherwise of fruit smoothies, which are a relatively recent phenomenon, nor did they look at the impact of different types of juice - for instance, whether it was freshly squeezed or from concentrate, home-made or shop-bought. I would assume, for example, that drinking a home-made vegetable smoothie is going to be a lot better for you than a commercial fruit smoothie. And I very much doubt that the occasional fruit juice or fruit smoothie is going to do any harm. Nonetheless, I've personally given up buying them and we rarely have them in the house. I eat whole fruit and when it comes to soft drinks I'm sticking to water, tea and, of course, coffee.

      <title>Could Concorde ever fly again?</title>
      <description>Could Concorde ever fly again?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24629451</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70641000/jpg/_70641820_183694639(1).jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Ten years ago today, our ever-shrinking world got a little bit bigger again. Three Concordes landed in a procession at Heathrow airport, while thousands of emotional fans looked on. After 27 years, the world's most famous plane had been pensioned off - first by Air France and then by British Airways - marking the end of supersonic passenger flight. So how is it that a noisy, polluting lump of aluminium, that was too pricey for most people to ride in, is still so popular? "It was probably more advanced than Apollo 11, which put the first men on the Moon." Jock Lowe is not only Concorde's longest-serving pilot, he's a former president of the Royal Aeronautical Society. "No military plane came anywhere close. It was so manoeuvrable and there was so much spare power, even ex-fighter pilots weren't used to it." Jock can't keep the joy out of his voice as he tells me what Concorde was like to fly. "The time we took it to the Toronto International Airshow, 750,000 people turned out to watch. I'll never forget that sight." He is modest about it, but Jock is part of an elite club. There are more US astronauts than there are Concorde pilots. Jock then recalled the time he was chatting to some pilots of the super-secret American spy plane, the SR71 Blackbird. Now, the whole point of that amazing aircraft was that it flew way beyond the reach of other planes. Faster and higher, hidden away. But one day, these guys said that their air traffic controller told them to get out of the way because there was a Concorde coming through. They couldn't believe it. Peering out of one window, two American military pilots wearing spacesuits. Peering out of the other, perhaps Joan Collins guzzling champagne - I'm guessing she was on the plane as she often was. I wonder if they waved? Technically, Concorde was revolutionary. It was the first aircraft to have computer-controlled engine air intakes. This may not sound much but it was one of the most significant leaps in aviation technology at the time. In any technology, in fact. It meant that they could slow the air down by 1,000mph in the space of about 15ft (4.5m). Without that, the engines would have blown apart. Concorde had carbon-fibre brakes. Again, the norm now, but back in the 1960s a technological marvel - and it was fly-by-wire decades before Airbus made that a mainstream technology. A decade on, there is still a lot of anger at the way Concorde was retired, with British Airways and Airbus both often accused of pulling the plug too soon. Almost as soon as the final flights touched down, a campaign was launched to get her airborne again. And it is still going strong. The Save Concorde Group (SCG) wants British Airways to either help fund a heritage flight, or release an aircraft to someone else who will. BA still owns seven Concordes, which remain scattered in museums across the globe, from Barbados to Manchester. "The only real reason for Concorde's retirement was politics, and that remains the single obstacle in the way of her return to the skies," says Ben Lord from the SCG. He told me that he is certain he can get a Concorde flying again for Â£20m ($32m) and he reckons Sir Richard Branson would still help him out with the money. "I still have a wonderful desk model of the plane in full Virgin Atlantic livery," says Sir Richard in his latest blog. "But despite offering Â£1m for each aircraft (they were originally sold to BA by the British government for Â£1) sadly our friends at British Airways were having none of it - and decommissioned the planes in a way that makes any chance of them flying again an unlikely prospect!" Talking of money, let's scotch that myth that the great gas-guzzler did not make any cash for British Airways. Going back to Jock Lowe, he told me that up until that horrendous crash at Paris in 2000, she made a net average profit of about Â£30m a year. That is Â£500m net profit over her lifetime. And Jock insists that in her final few months before retirement, she was still making money. Still, he does not think Concorde will ever get airborne again. And when I spoke to British Airways the answer was the same as it has always been. No chance. "We firmly believe that the technical and safety challenges of returning a Concorde to the skies are absolutely prohibitive," says BA. So will we ever see her like again? Well, the world's two dominant planemakers, Airbus and Boeing, certainly do not plan to build something supersonic any time soon. But there other options on the horizon. Sir Richard Branson's space plane Virgin Galactic is due to take its first paying passengers next year and he is promising that within his lifetime, they will be able to fly people from London to Sydney in two and a half hours with minimal impact on the environment. One final thought. I asked Jock Lowe if they ever did aerobatics when they were testing Concorde. He said they did execute barrel rolls, but never a loop-the-loop, although the aeroplane was more than capable of doing it. Doubtless it would have spilled some champagne. </body>

      <body>What do an Australian accountant living in south-west London, a 65-year-old sheep farmer in Wales, and council tenants in a rural Lincolnshire district have in common? The answer is a passion for energy efficiency that means that they will not be hit as hard as most by the latest round of gas and electricity price rises. They have built or live in properties where the insulation drastically reduces the need for heat. "You have to plug the gaps, otherwise it is like pouring water into a leaky bucket," says Peter Urquhart, the Aussie who has created an eco home in North Cheam. His project is no grand design, but a two-bedroom, timber-framed bungalow which his neighbours refer to as "the shed". Close to completion in a suburban estate opposite a primary school, only the modern chimneys protruding from the slanting low-rise roof give any clue that this property is different. But inside, skylights mean the rooms are filled with natural light and there is a ventilation system which allows the stale air going out to heat the fresh air coming in. Solar panels lay flat against the roof, creating energy for the underfloor heating. "It is unusual, but it is a home at the end of the day," says 36-year-old Mr Urquhart. The project, he says, took a lot more time, energy and money than he expected. Yet, for him, the reward is displaying an example of what can be done. It is not, he admits, a template for every home in the UK. After all, not everyone has the opportunity to build from scratch, or has the finance to spend upfront. Yet, the Energy Saving Trust says there are small changes that people can make to their homes to make them more energy efficient, and cut bills. They include the use of energy saving lightbulbs, turning off unnecessary lights, setting the washing machine to 30C, or wrapping hot water tanks in decent insulation. Mr Urquhart's motivation was his concern for the environment - a view shared by his wife Lucy. The result is a property which, he estimates, has only a third of the energy needs of an equivalent Victorian home - and 40% of them are provided by the solar panels. The arrival of three-month-old daughter Molly means they have changed their plans to move in, so now they want to sell before embarking on a similar eco home project elsewhere. He is not the only one looking to mirror the design of an energy efficient property. Sheep farmer Anthony Porter has planning permission to build three cottages on his land in the historic county of Radnorshire in Wales. He built the first after reading about American settlers who, despite a shortage of timber, built homes that lasted for more than 100 years. Their, and his, choice of building material was bales of straw. With the price-lifting, profit-making energy industry being portrayed as the big bad wolf, the house made of straw may have worked after all. Lanterns, wind-up torches, a shower warmed by propane gas, and a wood-burning stove nullify the need for mains gas or electricity. The two-bedroom holiday cottage, nestled in idyllic countryside, was built during eight months of huff and puff by Mr Porter and a builder through the winter of 2012. Now it is hired by holiday-makers looking for a break from the gadgets and gizmos of modern life. Mr Porter says it is more fire resistant than a timber-framed house, and carries no greater insurance premium than a standard cottage. The walls are plastered with lime mortar and the roof space is insulated with sheep's wool, meaning the whole building, excluding the land and his own labour, cost Mr Porter Â£31,700. "It was quite a leap of faith," he admits. It was even more of a gamble for the councillors of North Kesteven in Lincolnshire to spend taxpayers' money on building the first straw bale social housing in the country in 2010. But, after looking at the figures, they were convinced it would pay off. The three-bedroom family homes each had a building budget of Â£110,000, which the council says is Â£20,000 less than a brick-built home of the same size. They also feature sheep's wool insulation, solar panels and triple glazing, resulting in an average saving of 44% in running costs, the council estimates. Critics of straw bale homes say that the thickness of the walls means there is less space in the house than with more standard walls. The need to keep them free of leaks and moisture is also vital. More significantly, most homeowners and tenants do not have the opportunity to bypass big energy bills in the same way, especially if they are living in draughty, Victorian homes. While these projects provide an advert for insulation, very few people have signed up to the Green Deal - a scheme in England, Wales and Scotland through which householders can borrow money to install double-glazing, loft insulation, and more efficient boilers. Enthusiasts of self-built homes argue that building a home from scratch means a range of energy efficient installations would be easier to include than in older homes. Self-build is a sector being encouraged by the government with tax breaks, despite the fact that those who want to build their own homes often complain of a shortage of land, planning difficulties, and a lack of mortgage products to finance the project. "With the lack of new homes being built at the moment, you would have thought more lenders would be offering self-build mortgages. Many of the banks and building societies quietly pulled out of the market citing a lack of demand for their mortgages," says Aaron Strutt, of mortgage brokers Trinity Financial. And there is an added irony. The energy companies are suggesting that government-imposed "green" levies are getting more expensive and are pushing up bills for consumers. There is little doubt that before a solution is reached, and before eco homes become less of a novelty, household energy costs will keep on rising. </body>

      <title>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</title>
      <description>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</description>

      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

Tokyo is the world's largest metropolis and home to more than 35 million people, so on the face of it, it is hard to believe there is any kind of population problem at all. But Akihabara, an area of the city dedicated to the manga and anime subculture provides one clue to the country's problems. Akihabara is heaven for otaku. They are a generation of geeks who have grown up through 20 years of economic stagnation and have chosen to tune out and immerse themselves in their own fantasy worlds. Kunio Kitamara, of the Japan Family Planning Association, describes many young Japanese men as "herbivores" - passive and lacking carnal desire. It seems they no longer have the ambition of the post-war alpha males who made Japan such an economic powerhouse and no interest in joining a company and becoming a salary man. They have taken on a mole-like existence and, worryingly, withdrawn from relationships with the opposite sex. A survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2010 found 36% of Japanese males aged 16 to 19 had no interest in sex - a figure that had doubled in the space of two years. I met two otaku, who believe themselves to be in relationships with virtual girlfriends. This girlfriend is actually a Nintendo computer game called Love Plus, which comes as a small portable tablet. Nurikan and Yuge take their girlfriends, Rinko and Ne-ne, on actual dates to the park, and buy them cakes to celebrate their birthdays. "It's the kind of relationship we wish we'd had at high school," says Nurikan. In the game he is a 15-year-old, though in reality he is 38. "As long as I have time, I'll continue the relationship forever," says Yuge, who is 39. "As she's at high school, she picks me up in the morning and we go to school together. After school we meet at the gates and go home together... In the game I am 17." Yuge says he often puts Ne-ne - or the games console containing her - into the basket of his bicycle, then he takes photographs of them at his destination. Though Yuge would like to meet a real woman, and Nurikan is married, they say this is easier than having a real girlfriend. "At high school you can have relationships without having to think about marriage," says Yuge. "With real girlfriends you have to consider marriage. So I think twice about going out with a 3D woman." Nurikan says he keeps Rinko a secret from his wife, and hopes he never has to choose between them. It's hard to avoid feeling that otaku are in a perpetual state of childhood and are quite comfortable with their lives this way. Exactly why they have retreated into fantasy land is not obvious. Tokyo-based social commentator Roland Kelts says many young Japanese men are pessimistic about the future. They don't believe they will match their parents' wealth and don't want to commit themselves to relationships. "If you compare China or Vietnam, most of those kids on scooters going to nightclubs, and dancing their heart away and perhaps having sex - they know it's getting better, they know they are probably going to rock their parents' income," he says. "No-one in Japan feels that way." Several surveys have shown that even when Japanese men and women are in relationships, they have very little sex. In one survey just 27% said they had sex every week. Marriage rates are also plunging, and very few babies - only 2% - are born out of wedlock. Japan's demographic timebomb is also linked to the lack of immigration. In Britain one in eight people were born abroad, compared to one in 60 in Japan. But immigration in Japan is still heavily restricted, despite a dearth of some qualified workers. In Britain there are 60,000 healthcare workers from overseas, while in Japan - where there is a serious shortage of nurses - there are only 60. Japan has managed to preserve its unique culture in an increasingly globalised world but could that very sense of identity stand in the way of solving its population problems? Or is it just time for Japanese men to grow up, have more sex and make more babies? Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>John Carpenter reflects on Halloween</title>
      <description>John Carpenter's horror masterpiece Halloween turns 35</description>

      <body>In 1978, a low-budget film about a masked killer stalking a young babysitter in a quiet Illinois suburb took the film industry by storm. Filmed for just over $300,000 (about $1m today), John Carpenter's Halloween has since made more than $47m. Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. "I can believe it," says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. "I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid." Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, "was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders". "The idea was that every American girl can relate to that." After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. "The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was," says the director. "I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it. And I had the movie figured out and it was a lot of fun." Although the idea of a stalking killer was not a new one, having been seen in films like Michael Powell's voyeuristic Peeping Tom; Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13 and even Tobe Hooper's creation Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween's Myers was a different beast. "We had this idea of Michael Myers being not quite a human but almost a supernatural force," says Carpenter. "Evil as a force of nature in the personification of this man. "So we put him in a mask so he wouldn't have human features." The two-dollar rubber mask was a likeness of Star Trek actor William Shatner, sprayed a bluish-white - and it terrified people. "The best compliment I got was standing outside a theatre and hearing the audience scream, that was just delightful." Halloween ushered in the era of the slasher movies of the 1980s. Though they were not the first, it - along with Friday 13th - brought the previously niche horror genre hurtling into the mainstream. Carpenter, however, plays down his reputation as the father of the genre: "I think the main reason that Halloween inspired other movies was very shrewd producers looking and saying, 'This idiot made this for $300,000, we can do it and make money'. "It's all about making money in Hollywood. It wasn't about art." The slasher genre now looks relatively timid when compared with the explosion in what became known as the "torture porn" of the 2000s. Super-violent films such as Hostel and the Saw franchise undoubtedly built on the brutal nature of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Since then, filmmakers have returned to the basics with ghost films like The Conjuring and The Woman In Black, which have proved to be a massive draw at the box office. But Carpenter - who has dabbled in ghostly tales such as The Fog and Christine - again insists: "Horror films have been around since the beginning of cinema and each one leads to another so they continue to morph and change depending on society. "None of this is new, there have always been ghost stories. There are just new ways of telling stories." Though horror makes up the main body of Carpenter's work, the director has branched out into other genres such as the comedy-action of Big Trouble in Little China and the romance of Starman - which earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination. His influence on a younger generation of filmmakers can been seen, in particular in the work of Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn of Drive fame. In a recent BBC interview, he voiced his love for Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York - starring Kurt Russell as the anti-hero Cyclops Snake Plissken whose mission is to rescue the US president from the Big Apple - now a maximum security prison. "God, I loved that movie," said Refn. "It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulsey beat." Carpenter, roaring with laughter, is clearly delighted with the compliment: "Hell yes," he cackles. "Who wouldn't be?" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Carpenter is blessed indeed, for alongside the seven sequels to Halloween, no fewer than four of his films have been remade in recent years, with an adaptation of Escape from New York long rumoured. British actors Jason Statham and Tom Hardy are believed to be front-runners to take over the role of Plissken. "I'm mostly extremely excited, especially when they have to pay me money," says Carpenter. "I made my films and the remakes are the remakes, so its fine with me." After 43 years in the film business, Carpenter is now semi-retired but offers a word of advice to young filmmakers. "The biggest challenge is surviving the movie business and making films despite all the obstacles in your way," he says. "Nobody tells you how to survive. "I don't know if I'm as hungry as I was. I'm not as driven as I was, my entire life's goal was to become a professional director and I did that, I've nothing left to prove to myself." A 35th anniversary edition of Halloween is out on 21 October. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about Â£1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or Â£112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <title>The political prisoners who Burma will not free</title>
      <description>The inmates Burma will not or cannot free</description>

      <body>The military hat still hangs proudly on the wall of Major Win Naing Kyaw's house, on a peg just beneath what is clearly a favourite picture. The major, in sunglasses, stands stiffly, staring out sternly; next to him is his wife, Khin Moe San, with an infectiously radiant smile. Smiles are now in very short supply. Khin Moe San has just been to visit her husband in prison. "He's not well", she says, shaking her head, before telling me he's been "sad and depressed" since President Barack Obama visited Burma (also known as Myanmar) last year. High-level foreign visits are often accompanied by prisoner releases and this trip was no different. Of the 10 political prisoners serving life in the major's block in prison, nine were allowed to go free. Only he was left behind. "The government clearly hates him," Khin Moe San told me sadly. The major certainly has powerful enemies. Four years ago, he was arrested at Rangoon (also known as Yangon) airport. After spending weeks in jail, he confessed to leaking sensitive details of Burma's military ties with North Korea to journalists. Under a law more than 60 years old, he was sentenced to death for revealing state secrets. As is now common in Burma, the sentence was then commuted to life imprisonment. Khin Moe San tells me her husband's confession was forced, made after he had been deprived of food, water and sleep, and his family had been threatened. Whatever the truth, the major is considered by many to be a political prisoner. Earlier this year Burma's president set up a special committee to identify political prisoners and submit recommendations to the government as to who should go free. But those like the major, who are put on the list, are not necessarily freed. For all the talk of democracy, it's not hard to guess who's blocking his release - the Burmese army is still hugely powerful. Not many of the 133 names still on the latest list of political prisoners are straightforward. Often, the issue is about what exactly makes a prisoner "political". Some human rights groups are unhappy that those who have taken part in violence are included. What if someone has been party to the most brutal of atrocities - should they be ruled out? In a dingy room on the outskirts of Rangoon, I met up with one of the daughters of a student leader called U Sein. She showed me the only picture the family have of their father - a fresh-faced man from another era. In the 1970s and 80s, U Sein worked as part of the resistance against the dictatorship and then joined a rebel group called the All Burma Students' Democratic Front. On the frontline in the northern mountains, relations between the young fighters soured. U Sein was among a group accused of being government spies. Fifteen were executed outright. The rest were buried up to their waists in the ground - beaten and left exposed to the elements for more than a week. Having dreamed of bringing democracy to Burma, U Sein and 19 others ended up being tortured to death by their own side. One of the men leading the students' interrogation and torture in the mountains was called Than Gyoung. He is now in jail. But much to the horror of the tortured students' families, he may not be there much longer. Activists consider Than Gyoung to be a political prisoner - his name has been put forward by the committee for release. Bo Kyi, himself a former political prisoner, said he considers all of the students, including Than Gyoung, to be victims of the system at the time - the products of a brutal military dictatorship, and the suspicion and paranoia it created. Bo Kyi wants Than Gyoung released and then a meeting held with the families of the students, so that the killer can explain his actions and they can, he hopes, be reconciled. If it happened, it would be an isolated example of Burma delving into its traumatic recent past. The tentative democratic changes that have taken placed here in the last three years have been made possible by looking to the future, to avoid upsetting the army and its vested interests. All are acutely aware that scratching too deep or looking too closely at recent history could threaten Burma's still-fragile reforms.

      <title>Focus on growth on eve of EU summit</title>
      <description>Fresh hopes for growth at EU summit</description>

      <body>The summer is past and European summits return. Europe's leaders gather in Brussels on Thursday with the markets becalmed and some economic statistics to celebrate. Even the threat - a few weeks back - of the Italian government falling scarcely ruffled the markets. The promise by the president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, a year ago, to do whatever it takes to defend the euro continues to act as a shield against the bond market vigilantes. No one, it seems, is prepared to bet against the ECB. It is true that almost on a daily basis there are reassuring signs of progress. The Spanish economy has just edged out of recession after two years. Since 2008 its exports have grown by an impressive 14.6%. Unemployment at above 26% may have peaked. Italy is running a trade surplus and Greece this year will register a primary budget surplus excluding debt repayments. Ireland is set to exit its bailout programme in mid-December. And yet despite all the austerity and spending cuts the level of debt, amongst the countries that use the eurozone, is still rising. French unemployment, which was down in August, is set to rise again. Italy is struggling to bring down its labour costs without which it cannot be competitive. The Greeks are locked in argument with their lenders over a budget gap. It may need further funding. It was revealed this week that Greeks are, on average, 40% poorer than in 2008. Even the most Panglossian of Europe's leaders recognises that the recovery is fragile and solid growth is needed so in Brussels the leaders will concentrate on supporting and expanding the digital economy and building a single digital market. Discussions on telecoms, copyright, data protection, credit card payments and digital signatures can appear dry but are all central to what potentially will be the fastest growing economic sector in the future. UK Prime Minister David Cameron will try to focus the dinner conversation on reducing red tape and on revealing the cost of EU regulations to the business community. The difficulty for the European heads of government is that many of these ideas and initiatives take time when there are 26 million people out of work in the EU. Growth of at least 1.5% is needed to start reducing the unemployment lines. In the short term, the most important step is to make it easier for small- and medium-sized companies to borrow at affordable rates. Even while the focus is on growth, important decisions about the euro lie ahead but they cannot be taken whilst Germany is still in the process of forming its coalition government. Almost certainly those decisions will not be taken at this summit. The eurozone has agreed on a banking supervisor but it has not agreed on a resolution mechanism for winding up failing banks. The Germans do not want to pick up the bill. Yet cleaning up the banks remains the eurozone's biggest challenge. In Germany there is much discussion about Chancellor Angela Merkel's supposed plan for the eurozone. The idea is probably less developed than presented but countries would have to accept binding contracts which would give Brussels more power over national budgets and even social security and pensions. If that was to happen, the Germans say it would require treaty change and that is strongly opposed by the French. What all this underlines is that in the months and years ahead, Europe will still be building up its defences against the crisis re-occurring. On Friday the leaders will discuss migration from Africa and the Middle East and the need to prevent further tragedies at sea as occurred off the island of Lampedusa. Former French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said: "The EU has proved unable to forge a harmonised immigration policy... It is not even able to rescue those who still believe in the European dream." Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta has said that Europe "cannot sit there and watch" and has called for "immediate action". There is a general consensus that Europe needs to do more but almost all plans run up against difficulties. Perhaps the least controversial step is to put more resources into Frontex, the agency that patrols the Mediterranean. Others want to see the EU doing more to prevent migrants reaching the Libyan border. The EU already has a mission in the country but it has been frustrated at almost every level. Libya's borders are now so porous that persuading Tripoli to patrol its own shoreline is unrealistic. Some leaders will want an open discussion about "burden-sharing" and a change to asylum policy but this is politically sensitive. Very rapidly a discussion about migration can become one about "the free movement of people" within the EU. There will be expressions of solidarity but if there are to be major decisions about migration and asylum, they may not take place until June next year after the European elections. So as Europe's leaders come to Brussels their crisis is less acute but the questions remain: how can the EU deliver growth, what further steps towards integration are needed and what does solidarity mean in a union of nation states? All of these questions will be argued over in the year ahead. </body>

      <title>Bustling market towns hold the secret of happiness</title>
      <description>Do market towns hold key to happiness?</description>

      <body>Britain's bustling market towns are hailed as the places containing the secrets of happiness. New government research on life satisfaction concludes that cities and smaller towns should try to replicate the community spirit, thriving high streets and social networks of large rural and market towns. Data released by the Office for National Statistics reveals that the least happy areas in the UK are Harlow and Brentwood - both in Essex. The happiest are Fermanagh and Moyle, both in Northern Ireland. But why should that be? Identifying the factors that are linked to high levels of life satisfaction is one of the aims of the government's well-being programme. The idea is that ministers can then tailor policies to fit. What today's government analysis reveals is that happier places tend to have lower levels of ill-health, crime and unemployment. So far, so unsurprising. They also have higher levels of retired people and young couples without children. Among other factors linked positively to life satisfaction are "working from home", a rural community and volunteering. Among the negative factors are "women working full time", lone parent households and higher numbers of newly settled migrants. The data only identifies correlation rather than cause, so it may be that the correlation with the number of migrants, for example, may reflect an area's relative deprivation. The places with highest levels of life satisfaction tend to be larger than a small town but smaller than a city. The happiest places of all, it turns out, are larger rural or market towns. The government analysis suggests some of the benefits of market town living be "designed into" other communities. Among the official advice to ministers is the delivery of public services in ways which meet people's needs for social contact - fewer call centres, more real people, perhaps - creating thriving high streets and promoting volunteering. Above all, it seems, the secret of market towns' high well-being levels is their sense of distinct identity, community spirit and perfect size - small enough for people to feel included but large enough to remain private. </body>

      <title>Tim Rice unveils Eternity musical</title>
      <description>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked".</description>

      <body>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked". The adaptation of James Jones' uncensored 1951 novel is Sir Tim's first totally new musical for 13 years. Written with composer Stuart Brayson, the story follows the love affairs of US soldiers stationed in Hawaii in the run up to the attack on Pearl Harbour. The new version includes swearing, nudity and a scene in a gay bar. Some of the more explicit scenes will come as a surprise to fans of the 1953 Oscar-winning film, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, which included a famous scene in which the couple share a passionate clinch on a beach. "The film was wonderful but it was made in 1953 and, 67 years on, we can take different aspects of the book and look at it through 21st Century eyes," Sir Tim told the BBC after Wednesday's opening night. "Some people might be mildly shocked but I think we've all got used to a bit of that these days. It's quite mild compared with Book of Mormon or even Billy Elliot." The cast includes Darius Campbell as Sergeant Warden, Rebecca Thornhill as his married lover Karen Holmes, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, Siubhan Harrison as his lover Lorene, and Ryan Sampson as Private Maggio. Campbell said that, during previews, there had been some walkouts from the show due to its content. "The James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. We've explored that in a way that's very real and gritty, and honours the story." The Scottish singing star, who shot to fame as Darius Danesh on TV show Pop Idol, went on: "It hasn't been without some of the older audience walking out. "Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film - and wanted to see more - have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." 'Quite dangerous' Sir Tim Rice is best known for his partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber on shows such as Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. Lord Lloyd-Webber's new West End musical Stephen Ward is due to open in December. Sir Tim confirmed that his former writing partner had already seen a preview of From Here to Eternity. "He was very complimentary and I'm hoping to see his show," he said. Sir Tim's last full musical was 2000's Aida, which he wrote with Elton John. The pair had earlier worked together on The Lion King. From Here to Eternity sees the Oscar-winning lyricist team up with the relatively unknown Brayson. The pair first met in the 1980s when Brayson approached Sir Tim in the street and asked him to listen one of his songs on cassette. "I played it in car on way home. I rang him up and said this is rather good. I couldn't do much to help his pop career but when he began writing musicals I thought, 'maybe I can help,'" Sir Tim said. Although Sir Tim hadn't intended to be involved in writing the musical, as the production took shape he "ended up doing all the lyrics apart from one or two lines". Brayson told the BBC: "I must have sent him eight or nine musicals and this was the one that he really went for. "We didn't set out to do the movie. We set out out to do something that was different and quite dangerous in parts." In the audience on Wednesday night was James Jones' daughter, Kaylie, and her brother, Jamie. "We had our doubts when the idea first came up," she admitted after the show "but I'm thrilled - it's so sophisticated and moving." She added: "I was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes because my dad said this is just the way it was back then. "I think my father would have been amazed." From Here to Eternity, directed by Tamara Harvey, is booking at the Shaftesbury Theatre , London, until 26 April 2014. </body>

      <title>Nick Grimshaw loses more listeners</title>
      <description>BBC Radio 1's Breakfast show, hosted by Nick Grimshaw, loses 300,000 listeners over the last three months.</description>

      <body>BBC Radio 1 presenter Nick Grimshaw has seen his audience figures slump by 300,000 over the last three months. The 29-year-old breakfast DJ now has one million fewer listeners than his predecessor Chris Moyles, according to the figures from research body Rajar. With 5.58m listeners a week, the breakfast show is suffering its lowest audience for a decade, easily beaten by the morning shows on Radios 2 and 4. Grimshaw took over from Moyles in 2012, in a bid to attract younger listeners. Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said: "After the biggest set of changes to Radio 1 for a generation, we're really happy that the breakfast show sounds fresher, younger and more vibrant than ever and as a result 833,000 of the show's 'over-30s' listeners have moved on to other stations." Chris Evans appears to be the main beneficiary, attracting 9.34 million weekly listeners, while Radio 4's flagship Today show draws 6.8 million listeners. Evans' figures were up 800,000 on the same period last year, re-affirming his status as the UK's most popular breakfast DJ. Grimshaw, by comparison, has lost 305,000 listeners in the three months to 24 October - with audiences falling by 17% on the same quarter in 2012. He now trails Evans by 3.8 million listeners, a dramatic change from four years ago, when the breakfast shows for the two stations were almost neck and neck. Radio 1's breakfast show is now close to its record lowest audience of 5.5 million, recorded by Sara Cox in the last three months of her tenure, in 2003. Radio 2 continues to have the UK's biggest audience with 14.9 million listeners each week, up a million in a year. Radio 1 has 10.83 million listeners, marginally behind Radio 4's 10.87 million. "Radio 2 is a remarkable success story and continues to reach huge audiences whilst never failing to surprise and amaze with the diversity of its output," said Radio 2 controller Helen Boaden. Radio 3's total listener numbers rose 1.5% to just over 2 million, during a period that included its annual coverage of the Proms, while BBC 6 Music's listenership was up 6.9% year on year - despite a dip of 3.4% on the previous quarter. BBC Radio 5 Live grew its audience to 6.12 million, rising 0.5% year on year, while digital sister station Radio 5 Live Sports Extra attracted a record 1.52 million listeners following its coverage of England's Ashes victory this summer. BBC's Asian Network fell by 5% over the year, averaging 555,000 listeners each week. </body>

      <body>Dark Knight Rises star Tom Hardy will play Sir Elton John in a biopic of the singer's life called Rocketman, it has been announced. The 36-year-old British actor previously played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and has starred in films such as Inception, Lawless and Bronson. Rocketman is being made with the co-operation of Sir Elton, 66, who is an executive producer on the project. It will begin shooting in late 2014, Focus Features said. The screenplay has been penned by Lee Hall, who was Oscar-nominated for Billy Elliot, and recently worked on the film adaptation of War Horse. It follows Reginald Dwight's journey from childhood piano prodigy to global superstar, under his stage name Elton John. Hardy is respected for his wide-ranging talent, but his brawny, tattooed frame makes him an unconventional choice to star as the flamboyant musician. He is not the first actor to play Sir Elton. In 2001, Justin Timberlake appeared as a "young Elton" in the video for the latter's This Train Don't Stop There Any More. Last month, Sir Elton John played live at the Emmy Awards ceremony for the first time. He performed a tribute to Liberace, the American pianist and vocalist whose life was told in the recent biopic, Behind the Candelabra. </body>

      <body>British actor Jamie Dornan is in talks to replace Charlie Hunnam in the forthcoming film adaptation of erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. Belfast-born Dornan, best known for his roles in BBC drama The Fall and US fantasy series Once Upon A Time, will play lead character Christian Grey. Dornan is understood to have screen-tested for the role before Hunnam was cast, reports Variety. He is expected to sign up for at least three films based on the book trilogy. Published in 2011, Fifty Shades of Grey follows the sexually-charged relationship between billionaire Grey and college student Anastasia Steele, who will be played by Dakota Johnson - daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. The novel and its two sequels, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have become a literary phenomenon that earned author EL James a reported $95m (Â£61.5m) last year. There has been intense speculation over who will star in the film adaptation, which will be directed by another Briton, artist Sam Taylor-Johnson. Hunnam dropped out of the role earlier this month. Universal Pictures said his sudden departure was a mutual decision due to a scheduling problem with the actor's TV commitments. However, there have been reports that the Sons of Anarchy actor had been overwhelmed by the media attention. He was also reported to have been dissatisfied with Kelly Marcel's screen adaptation. Closer's Patrick Marber, who was Oscar-nominated for his Notes on a Scandal screenplay, is currently working on the screenplay, with Universal hoping to begin shooting next month. </body>

      <body>A Turner Prize sculpture of a nude man has caused controversy among some schools in Northern Ireland. The prestigious exhibition opened to the public in Londonderry on Wednesday morning, the first time it has been taken outside of England. The entries are on show at former Army barracks at Ebrington. Derry is the UK City of Culture 2013. David Shrigley's naked model has been avoided by a number of schools because it shows a man urinating into a bucket. Glasgow-based Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greeting cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. Schools from across Northern Ireland have been invited to the exhibition. Ann Murray, the principal of Oakgrove Integrated Primary School in Derry, said: "This particular piece of art is too much for some students. "We have younger people at the school, so I'd rather have their parents take them to see Shrigley's piece rather than the school. "We talked about Shrigley's piece, but we avoided that particular gallery. "Some parents may find it really offensive." Jack Malvern, the arts correspondent with The Times newspaper, said: "I personally don't think it's offensive. "What we have here is teachers who are worried about parents' potential reactions rather than their actual reactions. "If one parent says no then the entire class is excluded. It's a shame. "There is nothing offensive about this, it's humorous. "When I was speaking to people in Derry they told me that you have to take into consideration local sensitivities. They said they are a more socially conservative society." Denis Feeney, vice principal of St John's Primary School in Derry, said: "We didn't go to the Shrigley piece because it just wasn't appropriate. "The Turner experience was fantastic all round, but we thought it was just a bit much." Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. The winner will receive Â£25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. The other shortlisted artists will each receive Â£5,000. </body>

      <title>Sophia Loren wins 39-year tax feud</title>

      <body>An Italian supreme court ruling has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities. The argument centred around Loren's earnings in 1974. She claimed tax was owed on 60% of her income, but the state said it should be 70%. The Court of Cassation ruled in her favour, saying the actress's earnings were covered by a 1982 tax amnesty. "A saga that has lasted nearly 40 years is finally over," said Loren. "I always look to the future and I leave bad experiences like this one behind me," she was quoted as saying by the La Stampa daily newspaper. Her lawyer, Giovanni Desideri, said: "The supreme court has wrapped up a Kafkaesque case." Loren, who was born Sofia Scicolone and started her film career in 1950, famously spent 17 days in prison in 1982 in a separate tax dispute - an incident that drew her fans to the jail near Naples. She said at the time that her tax specialist had erred, meaning her tax return understated her earnings by about 5 million lire (then $7,000). Entering the prison, she said she was being subjected to "an unjust situation due to a little mistake by a tax specialist". The actress shot to fame internationally when she acted alongside Cary Grant in the 1958 film Houseboat. She won an Oscar for her heart-rending performance in 1961 film Two Women about a mother raped while protecting her daughter in war-torn Italy. In July, she was photographed on the set of a film version of Jean Cocteau's 1930 play La Voix Humaine - The Human Voice - which will be directed by her son Edoardo Ponti. </body>

      <body>The female head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) has been named the most powerful figure in the art world. Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani came top of ArtReview magazine's annual Power 100 due to "her organisation's vast purchasing power". Sheikha Al-Mayassa first appeared on the Power 100 in 2011 at number 90, rising to number 11 in 2012. China's Ai Weiwei, who topped the countdown in 2011, is the highest-placed artist at number nine. Other familiar names in the top 10 include art dealer Larry Gagosian, ranked at four, and Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota, placed at six. The latter was made a Companion of Honour by Prince Charles on Wednesday at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his services to art. Sheikha Al-Mayassa is the sister of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who assumed the role of Qatar's emir when his father abdicated in June. According to ArtReview, the QMA spends around $1bn a year (Â£618m) developing galleries, sponsoring film festivals and supporting public art. It also sponsored Tate Modern's Damien Hirst exhibition, which attracted more than 463,000 visitors during its run last year. Last year's Power 100 was also topped by a woman - Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, the curator of the influential Documenta 13 exhibition in Kassel, Germany. David Zwirner, who owns galleries in London and New York, is in second place in this year's rundown, while his former business partner Iwan Wirth is ranked at three. Sir Nicholas comes just behind Hans Ulrich Obrist and Julia Peyton-Jones, the co-creators of the Serpentine galleries in London. Compiled by a 13-member international jury, the Power 100 is described as "a unique snapshot of the contemporary art scene". According to the contemporary art magazine, those included are "judged on their international influence over the production of art and contribution to the art world during the past 12 months". </body>

      <body>Children's author Malorie Blackman has been named at the top of a list of the UK's most influential black figures. Blackman, who is the current Children's Laureate, topped publishing company Powerful Media's annual Powerlist. The author was followed in the top five by merchant banker Ken Olisa, barrister Matthew Ryder, athlete Mo Farah and media agency boss Karen Blackett. Blackman said: "Highlighting so many black people in such diverse different spheres is such an inspiring thing." She continued: "It challenges stereotypes and shows that many people are achieving great things. It's a fantastic showcase of the amazing success stories that often go unreported." Blackman began her career as a computer programmer and TV scriptwriter before being spurred to write her first book because of a dearth of children's stories featuring black characters. She has now written more than 60 books for children and teenagers, including Noughts and Crosses, Pig-Heart Boy, Hacker and Cloud-Busting. She was made Children's Laureate in June. At number two on the list, Ken Olisa runs merchant bank Restoration Partners and is a non-executive director at Thomson Reuters. A library at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge, was recently named after Olisa after he made a Â£2m donation. The names were chosen by a five-person panel headed by management consultant Vivian Hunt and including Thomson Reuters executive Olakunle Babarinde. The Powerlist is sponsored by Thomson Reuters and Lloyds Bank. A spokesman for the Powerlist said the panel was independent and the rankings decided on merit. </body>

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <body>Indian singer Manna Dey has died in a Bangalore hospital at the age of 94. He had been ill for the past few months and was in hospital for a respiratory infection. His funeral is due to take place later on Thursday. Born Prabodh Chandra Dey in 1919, Dey was popularly known as Manna, and chalked up a number of hit Bollywood songs in a career spanning six decades. He sang in several languages including Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Bhojpuri. His long career saw him win several awards for his contribution to music, including state honours like the Padma Shri in 1971 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2005. He was also given the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007. Dey sang more than 3,500 songs, including romantic ballads, intricate raga-based songs, Qawwalis and fast-paced modern numbers in his career. Along with Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh, and Kishore Kumar, he made up what was known as the "famous quartet of singers" who dominated the Hindi film music industry from 1950s to 1970s. Many of Dey's tracks for Bollywood films became huge hits and he sang for some of the biggest Bollywood names like Raj Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra. His most popular numbers included Zindagi kaisi hai paheli (Life, what a riddle it is) from the film Anand; Poocho na kaise maine raen bitayee (Don't ask how I spent my night) from Meri Surat Teri Aankhen, Ek chatur naar (A clever woman) from Padosan and and Eey bhai zara dekh ke chalo (Oh brother, look where you're going) from Meraa Naam Joker. He also sang for Bollywood super-hits Sholay and Amar Akbar Anthony. In the last few years, he had largely withdrawn from public life. Tributes have been pouring in for the singer from the film industry and his fans on social media sites. Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari led the nation in paying tributes to "a legend who enthralled a whole generation". "Deepest condolences on the sad demise of Manna Dey. His voice and unique style enthralled a whole generation. Another legend has left us," the minister wrote on Twitter. "Manna Dey, stalwart of the music world, passes away. Flooded with memories and his songs," tweeted Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. In another tweet, Bachchan said: "Strange how we connect events of our life with his songs." "Manna Dey passes away. His voice shall linger forever. R.I.P." tweeted film-maker Mahesh Bhat. Actor Manoj Bajpai tweeted: "Manna Dey is no more! A great singer! Let's pray for him! My condolences to his family! His music will live for 1000 yrs. RIP" Actress Shabana Azmi wrote: "Manna Dey had a unique voice. He will live on through his songs Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen/ dil ka haal suney dilwala/ poocho na kaise maine. RIP." Popular cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted. "Oh no. Such terrible news to get up to. Manna Dey no more? Less melody in the world." </body>

      <body>Robbie Williams is to perform duets with Lily Allen and Rufus Wainwright at a one-off live swing show next month. Muppets Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog will also appear at the London Palladium, singing songs from Williams's new album Swings Both Ways. He and Allen have recorded Dream a Little Dream, previously sung by Ella Fitzgerald and The Mamas and The Papas. The show on 8 November will be Allen's first live UK performance since taking a break from music to have children. The singer and mother of two stepped out of the limelight following her 2009 album It's Not Me, It's You, but in February this year performed at a Paris fashion show produced by former collaborator Mark Ronson. She is now gearing up for the release of her third album, which she promised Twitter followers in August would be "soon", and has also penned songs for the forthcoming Bridget Jones musical. Williams's latest record is his second swing-themed release after 2001's Swing When You're Winning - a play on the name of his previous studio album, Sing When You're Winning. Kelly Clarkson, Michael Buble and Olly Murs have also recorded tracks for the album, including I Wan'na Be Like You from The Jungle Book, featuring Murs. Williams's new single, Go Gentle, is released on 11 November, with the album following a week later. Swings Both Ways has also seen Williams reunite with long-term writing partner Guy Chambers for several new songs. The one-off gig is being filmed for broadcast on BBC One at a later date. A statement released by Williams's management quoted Miss Piggy as saying: "Moi is always thrilled to perform at the Palladium, no matter who I have to share the stage with. "But being up there with moi's dear friend Robbie Williams and Kermie will make this night even more spectacular." </body>

      <body>Two officials in China have been sacked after unauthorised "restoration" work left centuries-old Buddhist frescos ruined, state media report. The paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, and dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). They have been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures. The case, exposed by a blogger, has drawn widespread condemnation in China. An official in charge of temple affairs and the head of the cultural heritage monitoring team in the city of Chaoyang, where the temple is located, have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported. The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying. The scandal was exposed by a blogger nicknamed Wujiaofeng, who posted photos of the "restored" frescos online and compared them with pictures of the originals. The local government in Chaoyang immediately launched an investigation after photos of the new paintings appeared online, the Global Times reported. Permission for the work to go ahead was given by city-level cultural heritage officials after a request by the temple abbot. But it should have been sought from the cultural heritage office at provincial level to ensure national standards were followed. This had not happened, Mr Li said. The project was given to a local firm which was not qualified for carrying out repair works on cultural relics, the official said. With investigations still going on, more officials will be punished, the paper added. Experts who work for the provincial cultural heritage office in Liaoning have suggested the frescos could be restored to how they used to look, but they will never be as good as the originals. The "restoration" work has drawn condemnation from users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter. One user said "I feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey." Another said: "Ignorance is horrible!" </body>

      <body>Three Romanian men have pleaded guilty to stealing seven paintings, including works by Picasso, Gauguin, Monet and Matisse, from a Dutch museum last year. Radu Dogaru, Alexandru Bitu and Eugen Darie told a Bucharest court they took the paintings from the Kunsthal Museum in Rotterdam in October 2012. The suspects admitted they brought the paintings to Romania and had tried to sell them on the black market. The seven works have never been found and may have been burned. Thieves broke in through a rear emergency exit of the museum, grabbing the paintings off the wall and fleeing within minutes. The stolen works included two paintings by Monet, a 2002 piece by Lucien Freud and a self-portrait by the Dutch painter Meye de Haan. Speaking in court on Tuesday, Mr Dogaru said security had been "practically inexistent" and he had "entered practically just with a screwdriver". His lawyer went on to tell reporters his client said he had inside help. A spokeswoman for the museum declined to comment. Mr Dogaru told the court the paintings had been handed over to a Russian Ukrainian man and had not been burned in his mother's stove as had been suggested. Olga Dogaru, who is charged with handling stolen property, had told investigators she burned the paintings but later denied it. Her son also claimed at one point he had offered to return five of the paintings to Dutch authorities, but they had declined the offer and demanded all seven. Six Romanians have been put on trial in the case. One is still on the run and being tried in absentia. The next hearing in the case will be held on 19 November. </body>

      <body>World-renowned architect Frank Gehry is to design residential buildings as part of the Â£8bn redevelopment of London's Battersea Power Station. Gehry Partners will work with Foster and Partners on the 'High Street' phase of the development, a retail pedestrian street that will link the site to the proposed new Northern Line extension. Sir Norman Foster's company will design the residential buildings to the west. Gehry's firm will design the buildings to the east - his first in London. Together the companies will design 1,200 apartments, a 200-room hotel and 350,000 sq ft of retail and restaurant space. "Gehry Partners is honoured to have this wonderful opportunity to collaborate with our respected colleagues Foster and Partners on this seriously important project for the city of London," said Gehry, 84. "Our goal is to help create a neighbourhood and a place for people to live that respects the iconic Battersea Power Station while connecting it into the broader fabric of the city." Gehry is best known for such eye-catching edifices as the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Cinematheque Francaise in Paris. Yet his only construction in London to date was the temporary summer pavilion he designed for the Serpentine Gallery in 2008. Lord Foster, 78, designed London's famous Gherkin tower, the new Wembley Stadium and the redeveloped Reichstag in Berlin. Grant Brooker of Foster and Partners said the company was "absolutely delighted to be chosen to be part of this inspiring regeneration project". Famed for its four brick chimneys, Battersea Power Station was decommissioned in 1983 and has been vacant for the last 30 years. It is internationally famous for featuring on the cover of Pink Floyd's 1977 album Animals and has been used as a location in numerous films. </body>

      <body>Animated snail-racing tale Turbo has beaten Tom Hanks's true-life hostage drama Captain Phillips to the top of this week's UK box office. The Dreamworks film earned Â£3.9m including previews, compared with the Â£3.4m of Hanks's Paul Greengrass-directed thriller. Action stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone's prison break film Escape Plan was third with Â£961,470. The top five was rounded off by Prisoners and Sunshine on Leith. This week's figures are a lift on the previous seven days when Prisoners topped the chart for a third consecutive week, in a weekend which saw no release make more than Â£1m. Turbo, which features the voices of Ryan Reynolds and rapper Snoop Dogg, flopped when it was released in the US earlier this year, earning $21m (Â£13m) over its first weekend. With a reported budget of $135m (Â£83.6m) it only made $82.6m (Â£51.2m) in North America during its run, although it has since earned more than $224m (Â£139m) worldwide. Hanks, meanwhile, has won rave reviews for his role in the film about a container ship seized by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean in 2009. The film opened this year's London Film Festival. Bollywood action film Boss, starring Akshay Kumar, opened at number nine despite opening in just 63 screens. Averaging Â£3,732 per cinema, it took significantly more than Escape Plan's average of Â£2,656 per location across 362 screens. Romantic drama Enough Said, starring Sopranos actor James Gandolfini in one of his final film roles opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, missed out on a top 10 place but earned a respectable Â£170,357 from its 79 screens. While a second bad week for Wikileaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, saw it fall out of the top 10 to 13 after taking Â£118,397. </body>

      <body>Tim Burton is in talks to direct Michael Keaton in Beetlejuice 2, according to Hollywood trade magazines. Burton directed the first cult hit movie, which was released in 1988 and starred Keaton as a fast-talking, devious ghost from the underworld. The Frankenweenie director is currently working on the film Big Eyes, before going on to direct Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. The original Beetlejuice spawned an animated TV series produced by Burton. The film also starred Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin and Winona Ryder. Burton has been nominated twice for Oscars in the animated feature category - for Corpse Bride in 2006, and last year for Frankenweenie. Beetlejuice won an Academy Award for best make-up in 1989. </body>

      <body>British film-maker Peter Greenaway is to receive the Stockholm Film Festival's prestigious visionary award. The festival's jury praised The Cook, The Thief, His Wife and Her Lover director for "challenging the spectator like a true modern visionary". The jury said Greenaway had "created a new cinematic language by questioning traditional notions of artistic expression". Previous winners include Gus Van Sant and Wes Anderson. Greenaway has directed more than 50 films, including The Draughtsman's Contract, Drowning By Numbers and The Pillow Book. The director and trained artist will receive his prize - a bronze horse statuette - in Stockholm on 8 November, where he will also take part in a meet-the-audience session. He is currently professor of film studies at the European Graduate School in Switzerland and has curated art exhibitions worldwide. Earlier this year, Greenaway announced he was returning to the UK to film an adaptation of Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. "There is a surge of film-making activity in England and the studios seem to be more available," he told Screen Daily. Greenaway has not made a film in Britain since The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover, starring Dame Helen Mirren, in 1989. The film-maker famously declared that "cinema is dead" in 2002. The Stockholm Film Festival runs from 6 to the 14 November. Steve McQueen's 12 Years A Slave is the opening film. </body>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

      <body>Pop star Rihanna was asked to leave a famous Abu Dhabi mosque complex after posing outside the building for an unauthorised photo shoot. The singer tweeted pictures of herself in a black jumpsuit and headscarf on photo-sharing site Instagram. A statement from the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque Centre, said she was asked to leave after "inappropriate pictures" were taken. The photos "did not comply with terms and conditions" of organised visits. Rihanna performed live in the capital of the United Arab Emirates on Saturday. The mosque said Rihanna, 25, first arrived "at an entrance that was not designated for visitors". "She was confronted by the mosque officials and directed to the appropriate entrance to the mosque, to carry out a visit under the normal conditions." She was asked to leave after striking a series of poses for the photo shoot. The statement claimed Rihanna turned up at the mosque "without any previous co-ordination with the administration". Several of the photos could be construed as suggestive, with one showing the pop star lying on her back in the mosque's courtyard. The mosque is a major tourist attraction which welcomes non-Muslims - it had more than three million visitors last year. Rihanna's publicity team has yet to make a comment. </body>

      <body>Counter-terrorism saga Homeland has been renewed for another season by US cable channel Showtime, as has 1960s-set drama Masters of Sex. The fourth season of Homeland and the second of Masters of Sex will both comprise 12 episodes and air in 2014. The shows are aired on Channel 4 in the UK on Sunday and Tuesday respectively. The most recent instalment of Homeland was watched by 1.97 million, while Tuesday's episode of Masters of Sex attracted 848,000 viewers. The overnight figures are down on the ratings achieved by the shows' debut episodes on 6 and 8 October respectively. Homeland, starring Claire Danes as troubled CIA agent Carrie Mathison, was watched by 3.31 million viewers when it returned to UK screens earlier this month. And the opening episode of Masters of Sex, which stars Britain's Michael Sheen as pioneering sex expert Dr William Masters, drew an audience of 1.43 million two days later. In the US, both shows are broadcast back-to-back on a Sunday night, with the most recent edition of the terrorism drama attracting 1.8 million viewers and Sheen's drama watched by 1.4 million. "Homeland continues to prove its strength for Showtime, and is one of television's most exciting, provocative and widely-discussed shows," David Nevins, president of entertainment at the network, said. "The critical and audience reaction to Masters of Sex since its great launch has been incredibly gratifying. It's a privilege to get to work with such talented and creative people as [Homeland creator] Alex Gansa and [Masters of Sex's] Michelle Ashford, as well as their tremendous casts. "They have each created truly original shows, with distinctive voices that are among the most admired series on television." </body>

      <body>The Metropolitan Police Service will be the subject of a BBC One documentary series that will go behind the scenes at Britain's largest police force. Channel controller Charlotte Moore said The Met would be the first "definitive" look at the "vital" organisation. Over six hour-long episodes, she said the public would see the police force "in a way never seen before". Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was "delighted" to work with the BBC "on such an important project". "I hope that over the coming months, we can reveal the true scale and complexity of the challenges faced by officers and staff across the service." According to the BBC, the show will "take an in-depth look at how the Metropolitan Police Service works" and "show the scale and complexity of policing London on a day-to-day basis". "We have been granted extraordinary, unprecedented access to film from top to bottom of the organisation," said Moore, who nurtured the series in her previous role as commissioning editor for documentaries. The BBC One announcement coincides with news from BBC Three about five new factual and current affairs series. These include Slum Survivors, a three-part series that tests young people's resourcefulness in the slums of Lagos, Mumbai and Jakarta, and The Human Tissue Team, a two-part look at tissue donation. </body>

      <body>A previously unheard radio show recorded by David Bowie to promote his album Pin Ups is to be broadcast for the first time in 40 years. The 15-minute mock radio show, made in 1973, will be aired on BBC Radio 6 Music on Wednesday. The show features five tracks from Pin Ups, a covers album that features Bowie and Twiggy on the sleeve. The recording was discovered by Nigel Reeve, who oversees Bowie's back catalogue. He said it was a "jaw-dropping" moment when he played it for the first time. The five songs in the show - The Pretty Things' Rosalyn, Them's Here Comes the Night, The Yardbirds' I Wish You Would, The Merseys' Sorrow and The Who's I Can't Explain - are interspersed with Bowie's own musings on the London music scene. The show was produced by Bowie and Ken Scott, who worked with Bowie on his albums from Hunky Dory through to Pin Ups. Reeve discovered the recording during research several years ago. "It was in an old tape vault on 1/4" tape with simply the words 'Radio Show' written on it," he said. "This is such a rare find. No one knew of its existence, apart from David and Ken. To play it for the first time was quite simply a jaw-dropping moment." Clips of the show will be broadcast across Wednesday on BBC 6 Music and will be available to listen to until midnight on Sunday 27 October. Presenter Shaun Keaveny said: "It's beyond exciting for 6 Music to be showcasing the first-ever airing of this historic recording, in a year that has been all about the Bowie comeback." David Bowie broke a 10-year silence in January, releasing a new single, Where Are We Now, completely out of the blue. It was the first sign of his 24th studio album The Next Day, recorded in secret over two years with long-time producer Tony Visconti. The album is nominated for the Mercury Music Prize, which will be announced on 30 October. "As a network showcasing music of alternative spirit, David Bowie is at our core," said James Stirling, Editor, 6 Music. "It's fantastic that our listeners will have the opportunity to hear this radio show for the first time ever." </body>

      <description>Tinie Tempah on the mysteries of his new album</description>

      <body>Brit Award-winning UK rapper Tinie Tempah tells how Adele helped him pick the songs for his new album - and why his old school might not like it. Tinie Tempah has no eyes on the cover of his new album. They've been scratched out, painted over. And deliberately so. "I'm trying to make it about the music again," he explains. "It felt like I was starting to become a personality. People were starting to know me for lots of other things, which is cool, but I just want it to be about the music. "Don't look at the eyes, listen to the voice, hear what I'm saying." Coming to terms with fame is a recurring theme of the star's second album, called Demonstration. "Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?" he asks on Children of The Sun. On Looking Down The Barrel, the rapper admits: "When I'm near the public for too long, I act fidgety." "You can definitely hear me battling to hold onto that sense of normality and reality, as opposed to being thrown into this mad world of celebrity," says the 24-year-old. The success of his Mercury-nominated debut made Tinie a tabloid fixture - linked with Rihanna and Nicole Scherzinger in the gossip columns. But thankfully his new album isn't an awful "tears of a pop star" sobfest about empty hotel rooms and emptier relationships. Instead, he lists his distractions - New York fashion week, partying in Las Vegas - before admonishing himself: "Oy oy, mate, don't sell out!" "The most important thing is self-awareness," he says - but witty lyrics help, too. He writes, on the Daft Punk-referencing Lover Not A Fighter - about meeting his old teacher, who declares herself a fan and tries (successfully) "to get in my jeans". Is it a true story? "It's not directly literal," he laughs. "Without sounding un-gentlemanly, it may not necessarily have been 'my teacher', but it could have been 'a teacher.'" Nonetheless, he's keen to find out how the song is received in his old school staff room. "It's going to be like a game of Cluedo! They're going to be looking around - 'was it you?'" Born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu, Tinie Tempah grew up in the notorious, now-condemned Aylesbury estate in Peckham. His parents had come to the UK from Nigeria in their 20s. His father, a barber, retrained as a social worker and his mother worked as a human resources officer. By the time Tinie was 12, they had saved enough money to move to Plumstead - a short walk from the O2 Arena, which he headlines in December. The youngster picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology. But his life changed when he saw the music video for So Solid Crew's 21 Seconds: Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double-glazing to fund his first music video, and was being played on radio stations like KISS and BBC Radio 1Xtra before he signed a record deal with Parlophone in 2009. Five of the singles from his first album, Disc-Overy, hit the UK top 20 - while the inspirational, rap-rock crossover Written In The Stars made him a star in America, too. But the follow-up was delayed while his record label Parlophone changed hands, as part of the huge Universal-EMI merger. "There was a holding period where I could release the album in England, but I wouldn't have been able to release it in the rest of the world," says the musician. "It was a mad, compromising time. I remember Coldplay had just brought out their album and Chris Martin said to me, 'everyone who got out their album at the start of the year was lucky because there's going to have to be a long wait.'" Tinie filled the time writing new songs, and releasing others for free online. "I've realised more and more you need to get your ideas out," he says. "Unless you know you've made another Heal The World, I don't think you should hold on to music. "If you empty your tank it'll refill again." Forever attired in a tailored jacket, dark blue denim and his trademark, thick-rimmed spectacles, Tinie was named Britain's best-dressed man by GQ Magazine two years ago. He told the editors he maintained a sharp appearance because "it would be weird if I was wearing exactly what someone in the crowd was wearing. What would set me aside from them?" But off-stage, he is determined to stay grounded. His cousin is his manager, he's constantly in touch with his mum, and everyone has the right to put him in his place. "I don't consider myself a crazy person, so if I do get a good telling-off, I usually know it's for something worthwhile," he says. He's coy about his transgressions, though - admitting only that he gets carried away in clothes shops. "People will say, 'you're never going to wear that, you're getting excited,'" he laughs. "I'm not off the rails... yet, anyway." However, he can't help referencing his new-found wealth on his record. Lines like "I'm putting on the pounds but I ain't gaining weight" permeate the new album - but does he worry that bragging about success will alienate fans? "I definitely do think that," he says, "but all these things are happening to me and you can't not say it. "You know when you've put a lot of water in a balloon, and it's getting bigger and bigger? Sometimes I just want to burst with excitement - and where else should I say that, if not in my music?" He hopes the lyrics give fans something to aspire to - the same way So Solid Crew inspired him. "I always feel an obligation to anybody who's trying to be like me," he says. "I'm a British musician and I'm very much in pop culture - but I have come from grime, a genre of music which is still very niche, and is still very underground." "Given where I've come from, there's an obligation to say, 'you know what? The world is a big place, and the moment I left here and applied myself, great things happened.'" He certainly moves in high circles. He got feedback on the new album from Coldplay's Chris Martin, while Adele advised him on the track list. He's also been picking up tips in Hollywood. "I was lucky enough to go to Jennifer Lopez's house [and] she basically said to me that anybody at the top of their game is constantly still studying their craft. "She gave me an example of the fact that Will Smith, whenever he shoots a movie, still has his acting coach on the other side of the camera. "Even though he's at the top of his game, he still wants to learn. It's such a humbling thing for me, you know, so that was a really good bit of advice." Unsurprisingly, his ambitions are global: Hearing Beyonce sing Irreplaceable in Spanish (Irreempazable) made him realise that success wasn't just determined by breaking America. "Playing in Kuala Lumpur or Sri Lanka is just as good a feeling as playing in America," he says. "It's just about being as big an artist as I can be. "I believe in the magic of music. Hopefully one day I'll make the right song, or the right album, that will impact the whole world." Tinie Tempah releases the single Children of the Sun on Monday, 28 October. His album, Demonstration follows on 4 November. </body>

      <title>John Carpenter reflects on Halloween</title>
      <description>John Carpenter reflects on hit horror Halloween as it turns 35</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24296254</url>

      <body>In 1978, a low-budget film about a masked killer stalking a young babysitter in a quiet Illinois suburb took the film industry by storm. Filmed for just over $300,000 (about $1m today), John Carpenter's Halloween has since made more than $47m. Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. "I can believe it," says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. "I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid." Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, "was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders". "The idea was that every American girl can relate to that." After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. "The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was," says the director. "I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it. And I had the movie figured out and it was a lot of fun." Although the idea of a stalking killer was not a new one, having been seen in films like Michael Powell's voyeuristic Peeping Tom; Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13 and even Tobe Hooper's creation Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween's Myers was a different beast. "We had this idea of Michael Myers being not quite a human but almost a supernatural force," says Carpenter. "Evil as a force of nature in the personification of this man. "So we put him in a mask so he wouldn't have human features." The two-dollar rubber mask was a likeness of Star Trek actor William Shatner, sprayed a bluish-white - and it terrified people. "The best compliment I got was standing outside a theatre and hearing the audience scream, that was just delightful." Halloween ushered in the era of the slasher movies of the 1980s. Though they were not the first, it - along with Friday 13th - brought the previously niche horror genre hurtling into the mainstream. Carpenter, however, plays down his reputation as the father of the genre: "I think the main reason that Halloween inspired other movies was very shrewd producers looking and saying, 'This idiot made this for $300,000, we can do it and make money'. "It's all about making money in Hollywood. It wasn't about art." The slasher genre now looks relatively timid when compared with the explosion in what became known as the "torture porn" of the 2000s. Super-violent films such as Hostel and the Saw franchise undoubtedly built on the brutal nature of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Since then, filmmakers have returned to the basics with ghost films like The Conjuring and The Woman In Black, which have proved to be a massive draw at the box office. But Carpenter - who has dabbled in ghostly tales such as The Fog and Christine - again insists: "Horror films have been around since the beginning of cinema and each one leads to another so they continue to morph and change depending on society. "None of this is new, there have always been ghost stories. There are just new ways of telling stories." Though horror makes up the main body of Carpenter's work, the director has branched out into other genres such as the comedy-action of Big Trouble in Little China and the romance of Starman - which earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination. His influence on a younger generation of filmmakers can been seen, in particular in the work of Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn of Drive fame. In a recent BBC interview, he voiced his love for Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York - starring Kurt Russell as the anti-hero Cyclops Snake Plissken whose mission is to rescue the US president from the Big Apple - now a maximum security prison. "God, I loved that movie," said Refn. "It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulsey beat." Carpenter, roaring with laughter, is clearly delighted with the compliment: "Hell yes," he cackles. "Who wouldn't be?" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Carpenter is blessed indeed, for alongside the seven sequels to Halloween, no fewer than four of his films have been remade in recent years, with an adaptation of Escape from New York long rumoured. British actors Jason Statham and Tom Hardy are believed to be front-runners to take over the role of Plissken. "I'm mostly extremely excited, especially when they have to pay me money," says Carpenter. "I made my films and the remakes are the remakes, so its fine with me." After 43 years in the film business, Carpenter is now semi-retired but offers a word of advice to young filmmakers. "The biggest challenge is surviving the movie business and making films despite all the obstacles in your way," he says. "Nobody tells you how to survive. "I don't know if I'm as hungry as I was. I'm not as driven as I was, my entire life's goal was to become a professional director and I did that, I've nothing left to prove to myself." A 35th anniversary edition of Halloween is out on 21 October. </body>

      <body>Soul legend Edwin Starr had worldwide success in the 1960s and 70s with hits including the classic protest song War. But the Nashville-born singer spent the final years of his life thousands of miles from the Motown heartland of Detroit. He died in Chilwell - on the outskirts of Nottingham - in 2003. A decade later, Starr's younger brother Angelo Starr and manager Lilian Kyle look back on his life and chart his unusual journey to the English suburbs.

      <body>Mark Wilson was 14 when, in 1976, he first heard the Sex Pistols. He spent the best part of the next four decades collecting all the band memorabilia he could get his hands on. But then he made the hardest decision of his life - to sell it. He stood at the back of the auction room, watching people claim his hoard, piece by piece. Each nod, each subtly raised hand brought him closer to an empty house. "I didn't want to be part of it," he says. "I think, if I could have, I would have probably pulled them out at the last minute." But it was the right time to "get rid of it", he says. "Once the first thing was sold that was it, the beginning of the end." His wife, Sandra, quietly mouths that giving it up "nearly killed him". Like many collectors, Mark had no intention of collecting - he just bought a record. With the Pistols' debut single, Anarchy in the UK, a near 40-year love affair began. He started wearing tight trousers, ripped T-shirts, safety pins, padlocks and spiked hair. His parents "weren't impressed at all". "I got the next record, then the next one, then the next one and then I decided to go to Virgin Records and I asked them, what are you doing with the poster?," he says. Mark moved from the north-east of England to London in the early 1980s and started trawling markets such as Portobello Road "picking stuff up when it wasn't popular". He paid Â£100 for an Anarchy in the UK promotional poster - eventually selling it for 12 times that amount - but he bought for the love of it, not for the hope of profit, he says. There was a limit to how much money he would spend but not, it seems, to how much time, especially when it came to bidding on internet auction sites. "I sat up one night until 3 o'clock in the morning. I was at work the next day at 7," he says. "I just sat and waited and waited and waited. And I got it." Years later - and back in Gateshead - the punk clothes were long gone but his passion for the band was still intact. He let it take over his house. In his sitting room were framed shirts designed by Vivienne Westwood. Sandra said they were "appropriate and nice" but "looked different". Little did she realise she had Â£2,000 worth of muslin cloth on her wall. "You become accustomed to it," she says. "You've got to give and take. It did make the house unusual and everybody used to ask about it." She only put her foot down over one "disgusting" T-shirt. It stayed on the bedroom wall - but behind a wardrobe. Records, CDs and most of the shirts were in blanket boxes. The posters, cuttings, passes and autographs were all framed and up on the walls. "I've got a room in the house which I use as an office that was covered from the skirting boards to the ceiling and even on the ceiling," Mark says. "Literally covered. You could not see that room. "There was a lot of stuff I didn't have framed. Just didn't have the space, I would have had to move into a mansion." The precious vinyl singles and LPs had not been played for a long time but Mark is never very far away from a Sex Pistols CD. Apart from Sid Vicious's signature and a few pieces which did not sell, they are all he has left after the auction. He admits the money came at a good time since he had just opened a second hand furniture shop but he is adamant he "certainly wasn't forced to sell it". "Once it was over I was back to normal," he says. "That was it. Finished. Wait for the cheque". He does not miss it, he says. "It's in my head. I still play the records. I've still got the Sid Vicious autograph. Times move on. "They'll never take my memories away." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

An amber alert for wind has been issued and there is also concern that heavy rain could cause flooding. The Met Office said the public in the affected area "should be prepared for the risk of falling trees as well as damage to buildings and other structures" caused by strong winds. There is uncertainty about the timing of the storm at this stage. Colin Seddon from the BBC Weather Centre said it "is certainly the worst storm we've seen this year". He said there is potential for gusts of wind over 80mph, especially on exposed coasts in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent. </body>

      <body>Thousands of people in Greater Manchester have been queuing to get a chance of a signed copy of Sir Alex Ferguson's autobiography. The former Manchester United manager's book signing has started at a Tesco supermarket not far from the club's Old Trafford stadium. Some fans queued since Wednesday's European Champions League tie against Real Sociedad. Ferguson, 71, stepped down as Reds boss after more than 26 years in May. Fans have travelled from the Far East, the Middle East and all over the UK to the book signing. Wearing a dark blue suit, Sir Alex arrived uttering a simple "hello" before settling into his seat to greet his fans. He managed United to 13 Premier League titles, two Champions League successes, five FA Cup wins and four League Cup triumphs. On Wednesday, he rewarded one woman, who had began queuing on Tuesday, by calling to see her at 18:30 BST with a signed copy of his book so she could go back home to Wales. </body>

      <body>No further searches will be made for a missing man heard shouting for help from the sea unless fresh sightings of him are made, coastguards have said. A member of the public called 999 after hearing the man shouting for help near the Western Arm of Brighton Marina, just before 14:45 BST on Wednesday. The RNLI lifeboat was dispatched but the man had disappeared under water. Emergency services spent the afternoon searching the scene but scaled it down as darkness fell. Some clothes were found on the beach although it was unclear whether they were connected to the missing person, Sussex Police said. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) initially said the search would resume at first light. But a spokesman said it was now a missing person inquiry being handled by police. "If we receive any additional information or any fresh sightings then the search will resume," he said. </body>

      <body>Staff at a school in Gloucestershire that became infested with venomous spiders have denied they overreacted by closing for a day. Pest controllers were called in to fumigate The Dean Academy in the Forest of Dean on Wednesday after false widow spiders were found earlier in the week. Some people have criticised the closure, saying the creature's bite is not serious. A spokesman said the school had taken advice from environmental health. The school's education adviser, Phil Lomax, said: "We haven't overreacted at all. "When there's infestation of any kind in a school building it's important to take careful consideration of risk to health and well-being. "In this particular case, with the advice from environmental health, a quick fumigation allowing the fumes to clear and [get] back to normal was the best solution. "You can't actually know whether some students may be more susceptible to bites, stings from wasps, spiders or any other [bugs] either, so I think we've taken a balanced view here in the best interests of students." Some parents told the BBC they thought it had been wrong for the whole school to be shut while the problem was dealt with. Entomologist Steven Falk said: "[The noble false widow] has got a toxic bite but the bite is on a par with a honey-bee sting. "They're nowhere near as dangerous as the media is making out, so we're a little bit surprised [that the school was closed]." There were no reports of anyone being bitten by the arachnids, and the school reopened as normal on Thursday after Wednesday's fumigation. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most venomous of the dozen or so species of biting spider known in Britain. Its bite can cause severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers. </body>

      <body>A staff member at a mental health centre has been charged with helping a convicted murderer escape from custody. Lerone Boye, 27, was jailed for life in December for stabbing a 17-year-old boy to death at a birthday party in 2011. He was being held at the John Howard Centre in Homerton, east London, when he absconded on 16 October. Dean Ablakwa, 29, from north London, will appear at Thames Magistrates' Court later charged with conspiracy to assist an offender to escape. Officers in Hackney are continuing to appeal for help in tracing Boye, who is described as black, about 5ft 10in and slim, with short black hair. He has a scar on his right cheek, a goatee beard and a gold tooth in his upper row of teeth. Police have released an image of Boye moments before he escaped. People are advised not to approach him but dial 999. Boye was ordered to serve a minimum of 28 years for stabbing Kelvin Chibueze at the Arteflex Club in Ilford, east London. He was chased out of a birthday party and attacked with glass and broken bottles. </body>

      <title>US health chief becomes new NHS boss</title>
      <description>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service.</description>

      <body>A senior executive at a private US health firm has been appointed to lead NHS England - the most powerful body in the health service. Simon Stevens, who has worked as an NHS manager and acted as a health adviser to Labour, will take over from Sir David Nicholson in April. Mr Stevens is currently working for United Healthcare as its global health president. His appointment comes at a challenging time for the health service. While the NHS budget has been protected - it is rising 0.1% each year at the moment - the settlement still represents the biggest squeeze on its funding in its history. This is happening at a time when there are growing demands for care. There have already been signs the NHS is struggling to cope. Last winter pressure on AandE units meant the waiting time target was missed from January to March. Meanwhile, a growing number of trusts are running up deficits. As chief executive of NHS England, Mr Stevens will have control over the day-to-day running of the health service. Mr Stevens would be paid the same as Sir David - Â£211,000 per year - but had offered to take a 10% pay cut in the first year due to "NHS spending pressures", NHS England said. He will draw a salary of Â£189,900 in the first year. Christina McAnea, head of health at the union Unison, sounded a note of caution about Mr Stevens' appointment. She told the Today programme on BBC Radio 4: "I am surprised that they haven't been able to find someone within the NHS... and somewhat concerned that this is the Tory-Lib Dem government trying to install American medical values." Ms McAnea said she hoped it was not a "surreptitious attempt" to move away from the NHS values of "free medicine for all" But the chairman of NHS England, Sir Malcolm Grant, said they wanted to do a global search and believe Mr Stevens is the right person to lead the health service through the coming years. Sir Malcolm told the Today programme: "We wanted the best in the world and we've got I think the best in the world. Of course we've got somebody who's got experience both of the public health system in this country and of the best of American healthcare. "The NHS has to be open to ideas from across the world. All nations are facing a crisis in the affordability of healthcare and the American experience is valuable to us." Mr Stevens said: "It will be a privilege to lead NHS England - at a time when the stakes have never been higher - because I believe in the NHS, and because I believe that a broad new partnership of patients, carers, staff and the public can together chart a successful future for our health service." NHS England chairman Prof Sir Malcolm Grant said: "I am delighted that Simon will be taking on this exceptionally challenging leadership role for the NHS. "We have been through a rigorous global search, and engaged with a range of excellent candidates. "I am confident that Simon Stevens is the right person to lead NHS England through the coming years, bringing new ideas and fresh energy." Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "Simon has an extraordinary reputation in the UK and abroad as a reformer and an innovator, and we are lucky to have someone of his calibre doing such a vital role. "He will make a key contribution to the two biggest challenges facing the NHS right now - how to raise standards of care and also be financially sustainable. "His passion for our universal health service free at the point of use goes back many years but he will add international expertise as we face the challenges ahead." The announcement comes after Sir David said in May he was stepping down after seven years leading the health service. He had faced repeated calls to resign over his role in the Stafford Hospital scandal. Sir David spent 10 months in charge of the local health authority in 2005 and 2006 at the height of the problems. </body>

      <title>Power to regulate cyclists 'limited'</title>
      <description>Police and councillors seek new ways to regulate cyclists in Surrey after the success of the 2012 Olympic Games road races.</description>

      <body>Police and councillors say they are seeking new ways to regulate cyclists in Surrey after the success of the 2012 Olympic Games road races. Hundreds of cyclists now head to the Surrey Hills at weekends to ride the routes used in the games. Councillor Helen Clack said Surrey County Council (SCC) was limited in how much it could regulate cycling outside official races. But she said the council's new cycling strategy would be a powerful tool. Speaking at a public debate at the University of Surrey in Guildford, she said there was an agreement with the Mayor of London to co-host the RideLondon 100-mile race for five years. More than 65,000 people took part in the first race in August on a route similar to last year's Olympic road races. The penultimate stage of the Tour of Britain was also held in Surrey. "There has been a massive increase in cycling," said Ms Clack. "If we are in charge of closing a road then obviously we can regulate that race but we are limited about how much we can regulate cycling which is not part of a race. "We have written to the government and said listen to our cycling strategy." Chairman of Headley Parish Council David Preedy said road closures for major cycling events were only one problem for residents. "These big events produce a spin-off of a large number of people who come to practise on the routes," he said. "They are cycling as fast as they can on roads that are open to other traffic and that is a major safety issue." Surrey's Deputy Chief Con Nick Ephgrave said the Association of Chief Police Officers was reviewing cycling regulations introduced in 1960. "As a product of the enormous boom in cycling, we have people who are really enjoying it but do not really know how they should behave in a group," he said. "My officers are aware of the Highway Code but the issue is how enforceable is that in a county like Surrey completely covered in quiet lanes?" Cyclists in the audience at the debate, hosted by BBC Surrey, said they had suffered from the poor behaviour of motorists. One said she had been shouted and sworn at by drivers and had water and urine thrown at her. Another said she was afraid to use her bike on busy roads because of the amount of traffic. </body>

      <body>Surfers and swimmers have been warned to avoid some west Cornwall beaches after a mystery substance was found. A dog that ate the white glutinous substance died and several others were made sick, according to vets. Public Health England (PHE) said the substance, which is being analysed by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), was a "source of worry". Cornwall Council is putting up warning signs at beaches in the affected areas. Dr Femi Oshin, from Devon, Cornwall and Somerset PHE, said: "We are advising people to avoid contact with the substance. "At this stage we are not aware of any human health issues but if you do come into contact with the substance, please wash it off using normal soap or shower gel and water and wash your clothes." "We are aware of reports of the substance having an effect on dogs, who may have licked or tried to eat it. "We'd advise all dog owners to keep their dogs on a lead when walking them on these affected beaches." The beaches affected include Praa Sands, Porthcurno and Penzance promenade and PHE said it was possible that the substance would travel to other Cornish beaches over the forthcoming days. The MCA said early indications were that the substance may be vegetable oil-based. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

A car overturned on the southbound carriageway at 05:15 BST followed a short while later by a collision between a van and a lorry. Avon and Somerset Police said the man's family had been told and were being supported by a family liaison officer. One lane northbound, between between the junctions for Burnham-on-Sea and Bridgwater, has since reopened. Supt Chris Weigold said it was a "significant incident" which left the police with no option but to close the motorway. "I know this will cause considerable disruption to motorists today as people try and get to work, meetings and to catch flights," he added. "While we will work to get the motorway open again as soon as possible, people should expect the road to be closed for some time." Traffic is being diverted off the M5 at earlier junctions and along the A38. </body>

      <body>Dorset Police has announced plans to sell its divisional headquarters in Ferndown in a bid to save Â£500,000 a year in running costs. The force said 202 staff would be relocated to other areas of the county if the sale went ahead. Chief Constable Debbie Simpson said a review had recommended the force reduce the size of its estate. She said the force spent Â£6.44m each year on its facilities and savings were needed in order to meet budget targets. She said: "While there will always be a requirement for specialist facilities such as custody suites, the review has established that we need to minimise our estate. "The force is currently reviewing its use of Ferndown station and its administrative facilities to identify whether they can be accommodated elsewhere." Dorset Police's estate is valued at Â£49.5m and covers 80 sites. Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Martyn Underhill said: "We need to make sure that the Dorset Police estate is fit for the future. "If we lose a fifth of our budget and staff, we also need to lose some of our building estate. "These proposed changes are about matching our resources to the demands of the communities that we serve, in order to keep people safe. "I would like to reassure people in Dorset that we are committed to local neighbourhood policing and that police officers will still operate in the heart of Ferndown." </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when it reopens next year. The Bletchley Park Trust is restoring the site near Milton Keynes and expects to get 250,000 visitors a year. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to reopen the site in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <body>Olympic gold medallist Sir Ben Ainslie is to be made a freeman of his Hampshire home town at a ceremony later. The 36-year-old will be made an Honorary Freeman of Lymington and Pennington at the event at the town's community centre. He will be the first person to have been given the honour by the town council, which was formed in 1980. Sir Ben is also an honorary life member of the Royal Lymington Yacht Club. The ceremony, at 18:30 BST, will be attended by the Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire, Oliver Crosthwaite-Eyre, members of Sir Ben's family and fellow Olympians. Members of the public are also welcome to attend. Sir Ben, who was born in Macclesfield and grew up in Cornwall, has lived in Lymington for 13 years. He won four gold medals at the London 2012 sailing events, hosted in Weymouth and Portland in Dorset. He was knighted in the 2013 New Year Honours for his services to sailing. Lymington and Pennington town clerk Steve Cridland said: "We have been trying to get this done since January and tomorrow is the only time [Sir Ben] can make it. "It was his Olympic medals that sparked the whole thing but, of course, the America's Cup has happened since the council's decision." Sir Ben won medals at all five Olympic games from 1996 to 2012. Following his 2012 Olympic success, he was honoured with an open-top bus parade through Lymington. A postbox on the town's High Street was unofficially painted gold in his honour by resident Rob Smith. The act was initially described as "vandalism" by Royal Mail but it was later decided it could remain gold like the other 111 official postboxes painted gold to honour Team GB's Olympic heroes. The title of honorary freeman is generally given to people of distinction and people who have given their services to the local area. </body>

      <title>Dickson best for England - Fotuali'i</title>
      <description>Northampton Saints scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i says team-mate Lee Dickson should be England's first-choice number nine.</description>

      <body>Northampton Saints scrum-half Kahn Fotuali'i has said team-mate Lee Dickson should be England's first-choice number nine. Dickson looks set to compete with Leicester's Ben Youngs for the starting position to face Australia next month. "Fingers crossed he will be among it," Fotuali'i told BBC Radio Northampton. "Hopefully he will get a start for England. I would pick him as England's first number nine at the moment the way he's playing." Dickson, 28, has shared scrum-half duties with Fotuali'i since the Samoa international, considered to be one of the best nines in the world, arrived from Ospreys in the summer. And Dickson, who has been capped nine times, limited Fotuali'i to an appearance from the replacements bench for last weekend's Heineken Cup victory over the half-back's former Welsh region. Stuart Lancaster has selected Youngs and Harlequins's Danny Care in his squad for the autumn internationals, but Care has been allowed to rejoin his club team for this weekend's Premiership visit of Sale. That will most likely mean Dickson will be vying with 24-year-old Youngs, who is capped 33 times, for the clash with the Wallabies on 2 November, with places up for grabs in the subsequent matches against Argentina and New Zealand. "Lee is a credit to himself and has put in the hard work," added Fotuali'i. "Training-wise he is out there doing the extras - passing, kicking. We both do the same and feed off each other. "We learn off each other. Well, I learn off him and hopefully he learns from me." </body>

      <title>Crystal Palace plan Pulis approach</title>
      <description>Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish wants to talk to former Stoke boss Tony Pulis after the departure of Ian Holloway.</description>

      <body>Crystal Palace will approach former Stoke City boss Tony Pulis as they seek Ian Holloway's successor as manager, according to chairman Steve Parish. Holloway, 50, left the Eagles by mutual consent on Wednesday, with the club 19th in the Premier League table. Pulis, 55, established Stoke in the top flight before leaving in May - and Parish wants to appoint a manager with experience at that level. "He's never been relegated and he's out of work. We'll look," he said. Pulis was appointed Stoke boss for a second time in 2006 and two years later guided them into the top flight after a 23-year absence. Despite not finishing lower than 14th in five seasons in the Premier League, the Welshman left by mutual consent in the summer after being told the club felt the time was right for him to leave. Stoke's direct and physical style of football often drew criticism from other supporters and managers, but Parish said the Eagles, who play Premier League leaders Arsenal on Saturday, would approach Pulis about the vacancy at Selhurst Park. "I'm sure we'll try and contact him and if he's interested we'll have a chat with him and see where we go," he told talkSPORT.Â  "But I don't want to put pressure on anybody. We've started making a list, we'll throw everybody into that and see who we want to see." If Pulis does take charge at Palace, he will replace a man the south London club did not want to lose. "I was more than happy to get relegated and come back up with Ian," Parish said. "The word 'sacked' has never been mentioned among the directors. "I've spent three days trying to get Ian in the frame of mind that he can do it against Arsenal. "You'd love to have someone in place next week but I haven't got a list. I wanted Ian to wake up and say 'sorry about the blip' and stay." Holloway guided Palace to the Premier League via the play-offs last season after joining in November, and signed 16 players in the summer. But the only points his squad were able to gain in eight league matches this term came in the 3-1 victory against fellow strugglers Sunderland on 31 August. "All I can do is be as honest as I can and wish everyone at the club well," the former Blackpool manager said. "I need a little bit of time to chill out with the family, but I will look out for Palace's scores." </body>

      <title>Stott vows to return after injury</title>
      <description>Olympic gold medallist Etienne Stott says his second shoulder dislocation in two years will not end his canoeing career.</description>

      <body>Olympic gold medallist Etienne Stott has said his second shoulder dislocation in two years will not end his canoeing career. Bedford's Stott, 34, injured his right shoulder in 2011 and in July this year damaged his left shoulder. "It's possible to come back." he told BBC Three Counties Radio. "There is an increased risk of re-injury but I'd rather have that increased risk rather than not be able to canoe again." Following keyhole surgery Stott managed to recover from his 2011 injury in time to win C-2 gold at London 2012 with partner Tim Baillie. But his second setback, suffered at a World Cup competition in Spain, is more complicated, with the ligament becoming completely detached. "It's not a trifling injury, but the surgeons see this kind of thing and say it's possible to repair it," said Stott, who had finished second and fourth with Baillie in the two previous World Cup events. "You have to go out there and get on with it. What else can I do? I love what I do. The sooner I can get back the better. "Luckily it was on the other shoulder. If you destroy an old repair it's a much more serious proposition. "Early in the new year is when I'll be back on the water. So I've got a long way to go still. I'm probably just over halfway." The injury means the second half of 2013 has been a write off for the pair, who were unable to compete at last month's world championships. "That was Tim's year derailed as well. He's been doing projects closer to his heart and keeping fit," said Stott. "When we get back on the water we can hopefully get back to where we were." </body>

      <title>Churchill's 'secret army' bomb plan</title>
      <description>How WWII bomb manuals were hidden in plain sight</description>

      <body>They were Winston Churchill's "secret army", tasked with causing havoc behind enemy lines had the Nazis invaded during World War II. But keeping the identities of the Auxiliary Unit members a secret was crucial to their survival. One of the ways was by hiding bomb-making manuals in plain sight, disguised as old calendars and diaries. Its cover promises agricultural fertilisers that "do their stuff unseen until you see results". But turn the page and a comprehensive guide on where to plant explosives and how to make your own bombs is revealed. The Countryman's Diary 1939 is one of two manuals being auctioned later which shed light on the training and abilities of the guerrilla units. Sponsored by Highworth's Fertilisers - a fictional company named after the Wiltshire town near where the units trained - the diary gives advice on how to set booby traps and kill German troops using household items. It was owned by Louis Pugh who commanded a unit in Tenterden, Kent. The units were formed in 1940 following the Dunkirk evacuation when Churchill became convinced that invasion was imminent. The cells, recruited mainly from men of the Home Guard, were trained to operate independently and sabotage German supply lines as they invaded. The trained killers - who would have become the British resistance movement - were also expected to carry out assassinations. As the owner of a chemical factory, Pugh was deemed suitable to lead a unit that would specialise in using explosives. After training in Wiltshire, he recruited his unit from trusted local men, built a base at Gibbets Oak Farm and stocked it with weaponry. However, according to Jeannette May, senior valuer at Eastbourne Auction Rooms where the manuals are being sold, it had to be abandoned quickly. "It was discovered by a couple of courting lovers who went past and found it," she said. "Pugh took everything back to his house and stored it, while they built a second base. "However, he had a young family at the time and was really worried about the repercussions, for his family and village, if the Germans had invaded and discovered it. "It was estimated that the life expectancy for a member of one of the units - had the Germans landed - would've been 10 to 14 days." The manuals are being sold alongside photographs, three booby trap mechanisms and several medals. As the rarest items, the manuals are expected to fetch the most, between Â£500 and Â£800. Mrs May said the mundane nature of the covers would have been thought about at some length. She said: "Perhaps they chose 1937 as the date as they imagine a German sifting through possessions in 1940 would ignore it." Inside, there is matter-of-fact advice on how to kill effectively using home made bombs in cocoa tins. It reads: "The essential point is that for outdoor booby traps you must aim at killing by splinters - not by blast. Another very good method is to use an old motorcycle cylinder filled with gelignite. The fins fly very well." After the threat of invasion passed, the units were disbanded, with Pugh joining the RAF and becoming Flt Lt Pugh. He died in 1984. Mrs May said the items had been handed to the auction house by his stepson, but little else is known about his time with his unit. "Many of them kept it a secret until their deaths - they just wouldn't talk about it," she said. </body>

      <title>How dangerous are false widow spiders?</title>
      <description>How dangerous is the false widow spider?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24636116</url>

      <body>A school has been closed because of a venomous false widow spider, and experts say they are on the increase. But how much of a threat do they really pose? Sightings of Steatoda nobilis, the false widow spider, are on the rise. It is being cited as Britain's most venomous spider, and it is spreading. But experts say the species is not usually aggressive towards humans and that being bitten is rare. The species is becoming more common and more widespread, says John Tweddle from the life sciences department at the Natural History Museum, London. He says that "it's not an influx as such, rather that existing populations are expanding". And being bitten by one is not very common, explains Dr Tweddle. It's much less common than a bee or a wasp sting. "There have been very few confirmed incidences of bites from Steatoda nobilis, although adult female false widow spiders are certainly capable of biting humans if handled without due care - the smaller males are not known to cause bites. "It is not an aggressive species towards humans and is most likely to bite when accidentally prodded or squashed, or trapped in clothing." The false widow is believed to have arrived in Britain in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands in the late 19th Century, with the first reported sighting in Torquay in 1879. The species has most likely spread as a response to a changing climate, adds Dr Tweddle. "We're expecting the species to continue to increase its distribution within the UK. We tend to spot spiders most frequently during the Autumn as this is when many of the UK's larger species reach maximum size, so are most visible." The symptoms of a bite range from feelings of numbness, severe swelling and discomfort, to various levels of burning or chest pains. The severity of the symptoms depends on the amount of venom that was injected. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Although a bite is very uncomfortable, it's no stronger than a wasp sting, says Mark Champion from the Wildlife Trust. There is also a greater chance of dying from a wasp or bee sting, he adds. "The bite that it gives is mainly defensive, so it's not coming out to get you, it's not a horror movie," he told BBC Breakfast.. "The swelling can become the size of a tennis ball. It can be something quite big but it's not something we all need to panic about." A footballer was recently bitten by a false widow in his sleep had to undergo surgery to cut away the area around the bite. One newspaper has also reported that a man was left fighting for his life after a bite on his foot. Sara Goodacre from the University of Nottingham's Spider Lab, says there seems to be a "disproportionate worry" about the creatures and that such media reports are "scaremongering". False Widows are extremely prevalent in France and Spain, yet there are rarely reports of holiday makers being bitten, Dr Goodacre told BBC News. Furthermore, she adds, some of the media reports of the bites are not consistent with the effect a neurotoxin - present in a false widow's venom - would have. Responding to the footballer surgery, Dr Goodacre says: "That's what you would need to do with a venom that's slowly breaking down the tissue, which some snake and spider venoms do - but not the false widow. "People aren't always reporting the same consistent symptoms. It's important to work out if we are talking about the same thing, or whether it's an allergy where the symptoms depends on the person that's bitten. "This [false widow's] neurotoxin doesn't seem to do that. At best it's very unclear, at worst it's scaremongering." The bottom line, Dr Goodacre says, is that the false widow spiders should not be a problem as they are not aggressive. "Some people are clearly having a reaction to something so the question is what is it? If there is a problem we should investigate it further." According to the British Arachnological Society, false widows might occasionally be the subjects of mistaken identify. "It is difficult to obtain accurate evidence as those complaining of bites often do not see the spider but assume they are the culprit because of the absence of a bee or wasp," said the society. "Alternatively, they only get a brief glimpse. Rarely is the spider captured so that an accurate identification can be carried out." </body>

      <title>Sex Pistols 'took over my house'</title>
      <description>How a Sex Pistols collection became an obsession</description>

      <body>Mark Wilson was 14 when, in 1976, he first heard the Sex Pistols. He spent the best part of the next four decades collecting all the band memorabilia he could get his hands on. But then he made the hardest decision of his life - to sell it. He stood at the back of the auction room, watching people claim his hoard, piece by piece. Each nod, each subtly raised hand brought him closer to an empty house. "I didn't want to be part of it," he says. "I think, if I could have, I would have probably pulled them out at the last minute." But it was the right time to "get rid of it", he says. "Once the first thing was sold that was it, the beginning of the end." His wife, Sandra, quietly mouths that giving it up "nearly killed him". Like many collectors, Mark had no intention of collecting - he just bought a record. With the Pistols' debut single, Anarchy in the UK, a near 40-year love affair began. He started wearing tight trousers, ripped T-shirts, safety pins, padlocks and spiked hair. His parents "weren't impressed at all". "I got the next record, then the next one, then the next one and then I decided to go to Virgin Records and I asked them, what are you doing with the poster?," he says. Mark moved from the north-east of England to London in the early 1980s and started trawling markets such as Portobello Road "picking stuff up when it wasn't popular". He paid Â£100 for an Anarchy in the UK promotional poster - eventually selling it for 12 times that amount - but he bought for the love of it, not for the hope of profit, he says. There was a limit to how much money he would spend but not, it seems, to how much time, especially when it came to bidding on internet auction sites. "I sat up one night until 3 o'clock in the morning. I was at work the next day at 7," he says. "I just sat and waited and waited and waited. And I got it." Years later - and back in Gateshead - the punk clothes were long gone but his passion for the band was still intact. He let it take over his house. In his sitting room were framed shirts designed by Vivienne Westwood. Sandra said they were "appropriate and nice" but "looked different". Little did she realise she had Â£2,000 worth of muslin cloth on her wall. "You become accustomed to it," she says. "You've got to give and take. It did make the house unusual and everybody used to ask about it." She only put her foot down over one "disgusting" T-shirt. It stayed on the bedroom wall - but behind a wardrobe. Records, CDs and most of the shirts were in blanket boxes. The posters, cuttings, passes and autographs were all framed and up on the walls. "I've got a room in the house which I use as an office that was covered from the skirting boards to the ceiling and even on the ceiling," Mark says. "Literally covered. You could not see that room. "There was a lot of stuff I didn't have framed. Just didn't have the space, I would have had to move into a mansion." The precious vinyl singles and LPs had not been played for a long time but Mark is never very far away from a Sex Pistols CD. Apart from Sid Vicious's signature and a few pieces which did not sell, they are all he has left after the auction. He admits the money came at a good time since he had just opened a second hand furniture shop but he is adamant he "certainly wasn't forced to sell it". "Once it was over I was back to normal," he says. "That was it. Finished. Wait for the cheque". He does not miss it, he says. "It's in my head. I still play the records. I've still got the Sid Vicious autograph. Times move on. "They'll never take my memories away." </body>

      <title>Antique guns 'adapted' by criminals</title>
      <description>Antique and obsolete guns are targeted by criminal gangs</description>

      <body>Antiques and obsolete guns are being adapted and used by criminals facing a shortage of weapons, according to police. A decade ago, Britain's cities were experiencing a surge in gun crime but, following successful interventions by crime agencies and the government, the number of firearms offences annually is now half what it was in 2003, according to the Office for National Statistics. One reason is the supply of weapons has been severely restricted, forcing criminals to seek out other means of sourcing guns. The National Ballistics Intelligence Service (NABIS), established in 2008, helps police forces solve crimes in which guns have been used, identify individuals who import and supply them illegally, and track down people who are illegally converting or adapting them. On the firing range at its base in a Birmingham suburb, ballistics expert Greg Taylor shoots several rounds from a Russian-made Baikal pistol. Built to fire CS gas canisters, they were easily adapted to fire live 9mm ammunition. There was a period, a few years ago, where this was the go-to gun of choice for criminal gangs in the UK, but as a result of international co-operation between British and Russian authorities and those in the Baltic states, the supply has dried up. But other weapons have taken its place. In the laboratory next door cupboards are filled with evidence from active firearms investigations by the 28 police forces in England and Wales which NABIS serves. On the desks are microscopes used by the ballistics experts to match bullets to weapons and in the armoury is a collection of hundreds of different weapons, kept in store in order to be used to provide matches to crime scenes. Many were brought here rather than destroyed after successful prosecutions in the courts. One is the Hungarian Feg pistol which was used during an incident where West Midlands Police officers were attacked during the riots in 2011. They came under fire from gang members outside the Barton Arms pub in Aston. As a result, 10 people were jailed, including Beniha Laing and Wesley Gray, who were sentenced to 35 and 29 years respectively. Another weapon seized after that attack was a French-made Saint-Etienne army revolver, used by the French Army in the 1870s. Like many weapons of that era, spanning from the American Civil War until WWI, they can be legally imported as antiques. Though they were built to fire ammunition that is now obsolete, they can be adapted to fire modern bullets. "You can buy a weapon like that because it's of obsolete calibre, there's no licence required, and criminals are converting or modifying ammunition to fit," said Mr Taylor. As we are discussing the problem, a new addition to the collection is brought in - a single shot Derringer-style pistol, which might have been carried by ladies in the late 19th Century for personal protection. It is thought that a number of burglaries at antiques weapons collectors' homes across the country may have been ordered by gangs who are desperate to source new guns and rifles. There are stringent penalties for possessing a firearm, including imprisonment. However, NABIS say there are now "armourers", who illegally provide guns for hire to gangs because of the shortage of supply. In some cases, the same gun might have been used a number of times by different gangs in different cities. "In the UK, getting your hands on a weapon is probably not as free and easy as it is in some countries," said Det Supt Iain O'Brien. "So you have a situation where weapons can be used by different sides of a dispute." The next potential threat in this country is the introduction of a gun which can be made using a 3D printer. It would not need to be imported. When the ballistics expert tested one on the range, using a remote firing device and behind the safety of a bulletproof screen, it blew up. It would probably have caused more damage to the person firing it than the one being fired at. However, as crude as early versions are, they could become more sophisticated. </body>

      <description>Nick Clegg promises to set up a "champions league" of head teachers to be brought in to sort out failing schools in England.</description>

      <body>Nick Clegg has promised to set up a "champions league" of head teachers to be brought in to sort out failing schools in England. In a speech, the deputy prime minister said experienced staff could join a "pool of top talent" which would be "ready to move" at short notice. He also said free schools and academies must only employ professionally qualified teachers. Labour said voters could not trust what Mr Clegg said on this subject. Mr Clegg told BBC Radio 4 Today's programme that unqualified teachers currently working in schools would not be sacked under his proposals, but would instead be given the opportunity to "seek qualifications while you are teaching". He said the rules would not apply to private schools, which also employ teachers without professional qualifications, because "you pay your fees and you take your choice", but children using taxpayer-funded schools had a right to expect basic standards. Before the coalition relaxed the rules, state-funded schools could only employ teachers on a permanent basis if they had completed teacher training, regardless of their other qualifications or experience. The number of unqualified teachers in free schools and academies has gone up from 2,200 in 2010 to 5,300 last year, according to Education Department figures, although the overall number of unqualified teachers in the state sector as a whole has fallen. In his speech, Mr Clegg announced that, from September next year, the government would create a "programme to get outstanding leaders into the schools that need them the most". The team would be made up of head teachers and deputy heads, with recruitment beginning soon, he said. Parts of the Liberal Democrat leader's speech had been heavily trailed in the media for several days, particularly his expression of differences with the Conservatives over free schools, which are state-funded but autonomous. He acknowledged "differences of opinion, some strongly held", stating that his party wants all schools to follow the national curriculum, guarantee food standards and employ only qualified teachers. He said this "view has sparked quite a bit of excitement this week - and criticism", but added that he wants parents to make their educational choices "safe in the knowledge that there are certain safeguards". Downing Street has taken issue with the Lib Dem position on free schools, saying that, as recently as last week, Lib Dem schools minister David Laws had said he was "100% behind" the policy. But Mr Clegg said: "I am totally unapologetic that the Liberal Democrats have our own ideas." Labour's shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said: "Nick Clegg will be judged on what he does, not what he says. "Whatever he says about free schools today, the truth is this divisive policy is his - enacted by his Tory-led government because of his help and support." </body>

      <title>Teenagers' anti-sexting app launched</title>
      <description>A children's charity launches a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves.</description>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <title>Londoners 'taking university places'</title>
      <description>Young people in the capital are much more likely to go to university than anywhere else in England, a study reports.</description>

      <body>Young people in London are 43% more likely to go to university than their counterparts in the north-east of England, says a report from the Higher Education Funding Council for England. The funding council has published an analysis of changing patterns of young people going to university. It shows a widening regional gap, with Londoners taking an increasingly disproportionate number of places. The gender gap has widened too, with women more likely to go to university. The study from the funding council examines trends in young people entering higher education in England, between 1998-99 and 2011-12. The overall underlying trend is that more young people are going to university, with the proportion of 18-year-olds getting places rising from 30% to 38%. But this is not an even spread. The increase has been much greater among young women, with a current gender gap of 12%, compared with 3% in the late 1990s. This gender gap was even more extreme in the poorest areas, with women 35% more likely to go to university. The gap in university entry between rich and poor remains as wide in this decade as it was in the 1990s, although both groups have increased their numbers. "Young people in the most disadvantaged areas would need to treble their participation rate in order to match the rate of those from the most advantaged areas," says the study, observing that the difference remained "broadly stable". But there had been significant regional shifts. London had the highest levels of participation in 1988-99 and this was even more pronounced by 2011-12. The proportion going to university has risen from 35% to 48%. Schools in the capital have become among the highest performing in the country and a much higher proportion of youngsters go on to university than anywhere else. What makes this particularly striking is that in 1998-99, youngsters in London in poorer "low participation" areas were the least likely in the country to go to university. But by 2011-12 they had gone from the bottom to the top of the regional league table. There are 23% of youngsters in London living in poorer areas now entering university. The lowest level of entry among the most deprived is now in the south-east, previously amongst the highest. The study says that more than half of all the extra disadvantaged entrants brought into higher education across England were from London. The highest level of participation by constituency, Wimbledon, has four times the level of university entry for the lowest, Nottingham North. This more local breakdown showed the highest levels of university entry in south-west and north-west London, with the highest rates of increase clustered around north-east and south-east London. The report highlights the places with the lowest levels of university entry, coastal towns, former industrial towns in the midlands and north, rural areas of the south-west, the east midlands and east of England. Along with Nottingham North, the other lowest individual constituency was Bristol South. In terms of the increase in the young people going to university, the biggest increases in the country were in Barking, Lewisham Deptford, Croydon North, Bermondsey and Greenwich. In contrast, North West Norfolk, Bognor Regis and Copeland in Cumbria saw numbers going into reverse. The lowest regional level of increase over these years was the south-west. Prof Les Ebdon, head of the Office for Fair Access, welcomed the "sustained progress" in increasing participation in higher education. But he said that narrowing the gap between the most and least advantaged would mean early intervention. "This means encouraging children from an early age to think about higher education as an option, supporting teenagers as they make key decisions, and working with employers to reach out to potential mature students." He also warned that the fall in part-time student numbers would have a disproportionate impact on poorer families. Rachel Wenstone, vice-president of the National Union of Students, said: "It's fantastic to see that young people still recognise the value of higher education, but it remains a national embarrassment that where you're from remains such a key factor in whether or not you go on to university." Prof Michael Gunn, chair of Million+, representing new universities, said: "The increase in the number of young people from disadvantaged backgrounds entering higher education is one of the great British success stories of the last 15 years. "This is the result of governments being willing to fund an expansion in university places and widening participation initiatives and modern universities rising to the challenge. Without this commitment and increased investment in schools it is unlikely that any of this would have happened." </body>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when it reopens next year. The Bletchley Park Trust is restoring the site near Milton Keynes and expects to get 250,000 visitors a year. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to reopen the site in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <title>Call to improve RE lesson standards</title>
      <description>Religious education in schools in England needs to be more consistent, amid concerns the subject is being marginalised.</description>

      <body>Religious education in schools in England needs to be improved, says a group of RE specialists who fear the subject is being marginalised. The report calls for a more structured national framework for the subject and improvements in teacher training. Earlier this month Ofsted warned that more than half of schools were failing to give pupils good RE lessons. Report chairman John Keast says the aim is "securing the future of RE in our schools". The study, published by the Religious Education Council for England and Wales, is an attempt to tackle the "uneven quality" of how the subject is taught in England. The report proposes a curriculum framework which could be used as a "national benchmark". This suggests how pupils should be able to find out about different religions and their beliefs, festivals and symbols. It calls for improvements in how teachers are trained to give them more confidence in the subject. The National Association of Teachers of RE welcomed the idea of a consistent national framework for the subject, which would work in parallel to the revised national curriculum. "It is imperative that, in this tough age for RE, we provide teachers with a curriculum framework of high quality," said RE adviser, Lat Blaylock. The report also suggests that the current GCSE and A-level in religious studies should be reformed. There was controversy when the subject was not included in the GCSEs needed for the English Baccalaureate, with claims that it would lower its importance in secondary schools. Ofsted recently published a strong criticism of how the subject was being taught. The education watchdog said the subject should play "a key role in promoting social cohesion and the virtues of respect and empathy, which are important in our diverse society" but instead "many pupils leave school with scant subject knowledge and understanding". "Some schools boast good and outstanding RE, yet many cannot," said Mr Keast. "In recent years RE has fallen into a vacuum. Falling back on the safety net of statutory provision is not enough to ensure consistent high standards, strong teaching, adequate examination provision and clarity on what the subject covers. "Having a thoroughly reconsidered national curriculum framework is a means of changing both practice and attitudes to RE." "The modern world needs young people who are sufficiently confident in their own beliefs and values that they can respect the religious and cultural differences of others," says Education Secretary Michael Gove, in a foreword to the report. </body>

      <body>A school has been forced to close because of an outbreak of Britain's most venomous spider. The Dean Academy, in the Forest of Dean, said it "had identified an issue with false widow spiders" in its ICT block and other areas of the site. A letter from vice-principal Craig Burns to parents said the school would be shut on Wednesday to be fumigated. Conservationists believe a change in the climate could be the cause of an increase in sightings of the species. In the letter, Mr Burns said the school had taken immediate pest control advice on discovery of the spiders. Initially the decision was taken to close the ICT block but further discoveries of the species elsewhere have led to a full school closure. "This will enable pest control to fumigate every area in the academy and ensure everyone's health and safety," Mr Burns wrote. "There have been no reports of anyone being bitten by the false widow spiders at the academy but if you have any concerns please seek medical advice." The school is expected to be open as normal on Thursday. The false widow (Steatoda nobilis) is about the size of a 50p coin and is the most dangerous of the 12 species of biting spider known in Britain. There have been no reported deaths from its bite in the UK. Symptoms can include severe swelling, chest pains and tingling of fingers, with the severity depending on the amount of venom injected. Gloucestershire spider recorder David Haigh said people would have to be "very unlucky" to be bitten by one as they do not move very quickly and are not aggressive. He said he has never heard of a school being closed due to spiders, but said recent media attention on the False Widow has led to greater awareness. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <title>Near-drowned woman can pursue payout</title>
      <description>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson in Essex 13 years ago wins a landmark case at the Supreme Court.</description>

      <body>A woman who almost drowned in a school swimming lesson 13 years ago has won a landmark case at the Supreme Court. Annie Woodland was a pupil at Whitmore Junior School in Basildon, Essex, when she had to be resuscitated in 2000. She suffered severe brain damage. A claim for Â£3m damages was rejected in 2011 and that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal last year. The latest ruling now paves the way for her to pursue compensation from Essex County Council. Her lawyers argue that the county council owed her a duty of care "in the capacity loco parentis" when Miss Woodland, then aged 10, took part in a school swimming lesson at a local pool. The swimming teacher and lifeguard who, it is claimed, negligently failed to notice Miss Woodland had got into difficulties, were not employed by the county council. Lawyers for Miss Woodland, who is now in her early 20s and lives in Blackpool, argued that the school still owed her a duty of care, even when third parties were contracted to provide teaching. When the case was dealt with in the Court of Appeal, Lord Justice Tomlinson said the imposition of a non-delegable duty of care on the council could have a chilling effect on the willingness of education authorities to provide valuable experiences for their pupils. The issue before the Supreme Court justices at a hearing in July related to the criteria to be applied in "determining the circumstances in which a school's duty to its pupils under the National Curriculum can be delegated". In his ruling released on Wednesday, Lord Sumption found that the local authority owed a "non-delegable duty of care". "It is fair, just and reasonable to impose such duties," the ruling states. "It is consistent with the long-standing policy of the law to protect those who are inherently vulnerable and subject to a significant degree of control. "It is wholly reasonable that a school should be answerable for the performance of part of its own educational function. "Parents are required by law to entrust their child to a school and have no knowledge or influence over the arrangements that the school may make to delegate specialised functions, or the competence of the delegates." He concluded that if third parties were found to be negligent, Essex County Council would be in breach of a duty of care. Lady Hale said the decision was a "development of the law" and avoided the "unsatisfactory possibility" that one child could sue but another could not. An Essex County Council spokesperson said: "The Supreme Court has changed the law so that a public authority now has liability in certain circumstances for the negligence of its independent contractors where children or vulnerable people are involved." "This overturned the earlier decisions of the High Court and the Court of Appeal. "However, the question of whether Essex County Council is liable in this case remains to be decided and will be heard by the High Court next year." Miss Woodland's mother, Alison Morris, said she was "greatly relieved that justice has been done". She said: "It should never have come to this in the first place. No child should suffer in this way. This ruling will make such a difference to families in the future." Miss Woodland's father Ian said: "It has caused enormous damage to our family. "Up until this ruling, we had seen only injustice. How could the school not be responsible for our daughter during a National Curriculum lesson? "I hope that, in the light of this judgment, no other family has to go through the same as we have done." </body>

      <description>An exam body reveals that most A-level grade predictions from schools are incorrect when final results are published</description>

      <body>Most A-level grade predictions made by teachers are incorrect when the final results are published, according to data revealed by an exam body. Predicted grades are an important part of the university application process. Only 48% of predicted grades were correct for pupils taking the OCR exam board's A-levels in summer 2012, in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Almost one in 10 of the wrong forecasts, more than 15,000 entries, were incorrect by more than one grade. For this one exam board, there were more than 186,000 incorrect forecasts for that summer's A-levels. These teacher forecasts were gathered by the OCR board in May, a few weeks ahead of the exam season. As such they should have been more accurate than the January predictions used in the university admissions system. The findings could re-ignite questions about the fairness of a prediction-based university application system, before pupils know their results. Although, the exam body says, it means more than 90% of forecasts were correct within a margin of one grade. The A-level statistics published by Cambridge Assessment, OCR's parent body, show that teachers were much more likely to be over-optimistic about results - with 39% over-predicting, compared with 13% whose predictions turned out to be lower than the actual grades. Independent school teachers were the most accurate in predicting the right grade, followed by grammar schools, academies, sixth form colleges and comprehensives. The lowest level of accuracy was for teachers in further education. Predictions from further education colleges, as the least accurate at both ends of the scale, were both the most likely to be over-optimistic and the most likely to be wrongly pessimistic. Independent and grammar schools were the toughest in terms of predictions, with the lowest levels of over-optimism. Teachers were much stronger at predicting the highest grades, A* and A, with more than 60% accuracy. For C-grades, only 47% had been correctly predicted. But the figures also show that over a range of subjects, when a pupil is forecast three A-grades or better, only 35% of these predictions prove to be correct. Oxford University said that there were other factors considered in applications, as well as predicted grades. "We look carefully at a range of factors when considering a student's application, including GCSE scores, aptitude test results, interview performance, teacher reference and Ucas statement, so that we are not reliant on predicted grades to select the very best students," said admissions spokesman, Matt Pickles. </body>

      <title>N Ireland 'UK's happiest nation'</title>

      <body>People in Northern Ireland were happier than those in any other part of the UK last year, a survey has suggested. A third of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction as nine out of 10, said the Office for National Statistics. England scored lowest for life satisfaction, while Scotland was rated the least anxious country in the UK. It is the first time differences between UK nations have been published. The ONS used data from the Annual Population Survey from April 2012 to March 2013 which included the responses of around 165,000 people. Four questions to monitor personal well-being in the UK were asked: People were asked to rate the questions 0-10, where 0 was "not at all" and 10 was "completely". The survey took place between April 2012 and March 2013. While 33% of people in Northern Ireland rated their life satisfaction at 9-10, Scotland came second with 27%, Wales third with 26.8% and England last with 25.6%. Wales, however, had proportionately more people than any other nation in the UK who rated their life satisfaction as low. The ONS said Wales had the highest level of unemployment among the UK countries at 8.4% between February to April 2013. In response to how worthwhile people felt their lives were, Northern Ireland triumphed again with 37.6% choosing the most positive responses, while Wales, England and Scotland followed with 31.9%, 31.2% and 31% respectively. For happiness, Northern Ireland was again well ahead on the score board, followed by Wales with 31.7%, Scotland with 31.2% and finally England with 30.7%. Northern Ireland came a close second to Scotland however in levels of anxiety. Four out of 10 Scots rated their anxiety levels as just 0-1. In England, the southern county of Hampshire scored some of the highest average levels of personal well-being. Bath and North East Somerset, Cornwall and Rutland also registered high scores in the four questions. The lowest personal well-being rates were found in Stoke-on-Trent, inner London, Blackburn and County Durham. In Wales, Gwynedd, the Isle of Anglesey and Pembrokeshire were the happiest areas, while Newport, Blaenau Gwent and Caerphilly reported low levels of happiness. In Scotland, Eilean Siar, Orkney and Shetland, Dumfries and Galloway and Highland registered higher levels of well-being against the less happy areas of North Ayrshire, Dundee City and Glasgow City. </body>

      <title>University sells study-free MBA</title>
      <description>An online university sold a top degree for thousands of pounds with no work required, a BBC Newsnight investigation reveals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24618786</url>

      <body>A so-called university sold an MBA degree for thousands of pounds with no academic work required, a BBC Newsnight investigation has revealed. The American University of London (AUOL) awarded a fictitious person created by the programme a Master's in Business in exchange for a Â£4,500 fee. AUOL has insisted it is "not a bogus university" and defended the robustness of the qualifications it offers. Newsnight has found hundreds of senior executives listing AUOL qualifications. The programme contacted some of them, but they all insisted that they had had to study for their degrees. AUOL styles itself as a pioneer of distance learning, offering degrees and post-graduate qualifications in business, IT, law, education and liberal arts, humanities, and English to more than 100,000 students worldwide. Its website claims that that all of their courses "have been designed to the most exacting standards, in accordance with the most stringent criteria, in order to provide outstanding education at an affordable price". However, Newsnight found that getting the university to provide a qualification without any study at all was easy. The programme drew up a one-page fake CV for a management consultant Peter Smith, known as Pete, living in South London, which included 15 years of made-up work experience and a fictitious undergraduate degree from a UK university. The real Pete was actually a dog living in Battersea Dogs' Home. Newsnight sent "Pete's" CV to AUOL, along with a completed application for the Master's in Business (MBA) and Â£50 application fee. AUOL also requires applicants to provide photocopies of previous qualifications and a photograph of themselves. However, Newsnight was unable to provide either since the qualifications did not exist and the applicant was a dog. Despite these omissions, just four days after sending in the application, AUOL sent "Pete" an e-mail saying that his application for a degree based on previous experience had been successful and that once the university had received his Â£4,500 fee he would be registered as an MBA graduate within about two weeks. When Newsnight's reporter telephoned to check whether "Pete" would be required to submit any work, a university representative said: "No, no, apparently the APEL [Accreditation of Previous Experiential Learning] board awarded him the full degree immediately based on his qualification and his professional experience, so he doesn't have to do any courses." We showed our written application to Jan Bamford at London Met University which runs properly accredited MBA courses. She was incredulous that a degree could be awarded to someone "with such limited work experience and such a poor application". "I find it incredible that any organisation is awarding an MBA on what essentially amounts to the evidence that is on a piece of paper. That's appalling. Really appalling. And again it goes to the very heart of the fact the government needs to regulate this behaviour," she added. In order to hand out a British degree an institution has to be recognised by Parliament. However, it is perfectly legal to give the impression that a university is run in the UK even when in reality it is incorporated overseas. AUOL is one such place - seemingly based in London, but actually incorporated in St Kitts and Nevis in the Caribbean, as they state on their website. Despite its name, AUOL does not seem to have any physical presence in London. Newsnight found that the university's phone number is a Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, area code and that the bank that university fees are paid to is in Beaconsfield. According to public records, including the electoral roll, Professor Michael Nimier, who was the founder of AUOL, and Sonia Grimes, who is the registrar, live in the town. On its website, AUOL boasts some well qualified supervisors and says that "the university's academic staff are highly qualified and experienced". But when we contacted five Western academics on its list, all said they had never worked there and never agreed for their name to be used. George Gollin, an American academic with expertise in unaccredited education, told Newsnight that AUOL "did not stand up to scrutiny". "It doesn't have authority to award degrees. They are not degrees. They are pieces of paper and I'm guessing they are not able to sell very many degrees into countries where English is the first language." The university says most of its graduates study at independent colleges in countries overseas. Those affiliates are apparently independent with their own staff subject to their own local laws. AUOL simply takes a fee to help set the curricula and issue graduation certificates in its own name. On professional social networking sites Newsnight found hundreds of senior executives who said they had qualifications from AUOL. The programme spoke to a number of them, all of whom insisted that they did have to submit work to get their degrees. Dr Robert Oakes, a psychologist from Birmingham, who gives expert testimony in court cases, was awarded a PhD just five months after first submitting work. However, he told the programme that he had spent 18 months on his own background research prior to this and he was already a registered psychologist based on a previous degree. Dr Oakes said he believed AUOL was properly accredited, but that he has now taken the qualification off his CV. Dr Rita Bowser, a senior nuclear industry executive who was in charge of selling a new generation of reactors in the UK, was awarded a doctorate in business after submitting what she described as "significant amounts of coursework". Her employer, Westinghouse, said she is well qualified for her job based on 30 years of experience and two previous degrees including a master's from the respected Georgia Tech. Since AUOL is not properly accredited it is not possible to verify how much work they did, nor what standard was required. The university has claimed to be recognised by three different American institutions, but these institutions are themselves unofficial and unrecognised. The university is listed as "bogus" by the agency that values degrees for the Italian government and it has been blacklisted in five US states, including Texas where it is illegal to use any of its qualifications to get a job. In a statement AUOL told Newsnight: "We are not a bogus universityâ¦ and have always been upfront about our status. We have not applied for accreditation with any American, British or other official agency. Many graduates go on to higher education or hold important positions on the strength of our degrees." The university added that most of its study modules are on a par with those used by top distance learning universities and that it only issues degrees based on work experience in exceptional circumstances. </body>

      <title>'Students need eating-disorder help'</title>
      <description>Students with eating disorders can struggle to get treatment they need while at university, says a charity.</description>

      <body>Many students with eating disorders struggle to get the treatment they need at university, warns a charity. Without help, students with eating disorders risk dropping out of their studies warns Beat, which campaigns on behalf of sufferers. A survey of just over 200 students with eating disorders found 32% were diagnosed after starting their course. Almost a fifth (18%) said their condition had forced them to drop out of their degree course. Another 39% had to take a break from their studies. More than half (52%) of those surveyed said their university was not doing enough to support students with eating disorders or to identify those at risk and intervene to help them. Nearly seven in 10 (69%) said they had struggled to access treatment while at university. "We know there are a number of risk factors when young people go to university such as moving away from home and living independently, academic pressures, making new friends. "This can be a very vulnerable time for some people", said a spokeswoman for Beat. She said young lives were being disrupted at a crucial stage in their development by loss of education, damage to career prospects and in some cases, premature death. The charity is calling on all student counselling services and student unions to be more aware of eating disorders and to improve the help on offer to sufferers. A leaflet aimed at students outlines ways friends can support those with eating disorders and help get them the support they need. The leaflet outlines signs of an eating disorder in a friend and how to approach someone about getting help. "Be prepared for them to be angry, upset or say hurtful things. "The illness affects how someone thinks and can prevent them from being able to truly believe anything is wrong," it advises. The leaflet emphasises that no one chooses to get an eating disorder and that recovery is possible One former student quoted by Beat said: "Not once at university had anybody questioned my health or given me any help or guidance. "If I'd wanted to go and talk to someone I would have been completely at a loss where to go or who could help me. "This resulted in my condition worsening and I ended up dropping out of uni completely." The National Union of Students (NUS) said it was working to make support for mental health issues a higher priority in universities and colleges. Vice-president Colum McGuire said: "For some the stress and new surroundings that come with leaving to go to university can trigger mental health issues." "NUS is concerned about cuts to services that support students facing these challenges, particularly around poor referrals on to outside services, and whether those services themselves actually have adequate resources to help students." A spokeswoman for the umbrella group Universities UK said universities, alongside student unions provided extensive support for students, "including welfare officers, advice centres, hall wardens and university counselling services. "Every university offers student advice services, offering confidential and independent support and advice to students on a range of areas." </body>

      <title>Asiaâs parents suffering 'education fever'</title>
      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (Â£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (Â£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about Â£22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (Â£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (Â£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <title>Harvard tops global CEO league table</title>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (Â£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>School forgets time capsule location</title>
      <description>An Essex school is unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no-one remembers where it is buried.</description>

      <body>A school was unable to open a time capsule in time for its 50th anniversary because no-one could remember where it was buried. The plastic ice-cream tub was originally placed in the garden of Writtle Junior School, near Chelmsford, 25 years ago. But teachers now think it may have been removed from its original burial place. Headteacher Nick Taylor said the "desperate search" was called off in case they destroyed their garden. The school called in metal detectorists but to no avail. Mr Taylor said: "I think we've dug about three holes around our school garden and we've had to stop because we were slowly destroying it in our desperate search for the capsule." Writtle Junior School decided to mark its 25th anniversary by filling a time capsule which was scheduled to be opened on its 50th anniversary. Pupil Chris Green won the competition to decide the contents of the plastic container which included first and second class stamps, coins, a newspaper and a toy car. It was buried in the school's garden under a slab, engraved with its date. But despite digging "a very, very deep hole", nothing was found under the slab, according to Mr Taylor. However, the garden has been remodelled in recent years and deputy headteacher Sue Evans said she believed the capsule may have been moved at that point. Former pupil Karen Patient was at the school when the capsule was buried. She said: "I have told the the headmaster where I think it was buried but they haven't tried there yet - as far as I remember it was in a different corner, underneath a bench." Mrs Evans said she was sure they would eventually find the capsule if they keep digging, "although our gardening club might not recover". A second time capsule has now been buried to mark the 50th anniversary. Mr Taylor said this time the school would keep very detailed records of its location. </body>

      <body>Intensive exercise improves the academic performance of teenagers, according to new research. The study, of about 5,000 children, found links between exercise and exam success in English, maths and science. It found an increase in performance for every extra 17 minutes boys exercised, and 12 minutes for girls. The study by the universities of Strathclyde and Dundee found physical activity particularly benefited girls' performance at science. The authors said this could be a chance finding or reflect gender differences in the impact of physical activity on the brain. Children who carried out regular exercise, not only did better academically at 11 but also at 13 and in their exams at 16, the study suggested. Most of the teenagers' exercise levels were found to be well below the recommended 60 minutes a day. The authors speculated what might happen to academic performance if children got the recommended amount. They claimed that since every 15 minutes of exercise improved performance by an average of about a quarter of a grade, it was possible children who carried out 60 minutes of exercise every day could improve their academic performance by a full grade - for example, from a C to a B, or a B to an A. However, the authors admitted this was speculation given that very few children did anywhere near this amount of exercise. Dr Josie Booth, one of the leaders of the study, from Dundee University said: "Physical activity is more than just important for your physical health. "There are other benefits and that is something that should be especially important to parents, policy-makers and people involved in education." The authors of the study, published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine, said further research backing the findings could have implications fore public health and education policy. The study was funded by a grant from the BUPA Foundation to the University of Strathclyde. </body>

      <title>Schools must support health needs</title>
      <description>Schools in England are going to have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma.</description>

      <body>Schools in England will have a legal obligation to support children with long-term health conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy and asthma. A written statement from Education Secretary Michael Gove announced plans to introduce a "clear requirement on all types of state schools". Schools will have to take "reasonable action" to provide extra support. Campaign group Diabetes UK welcomed the announcement as a "major step" that could affect a million children. The announcement, in a written ministerial statement, responds to concerns that some children are being excluded from a good education because of their underlying health problems. It aims to clarify the rights of families concerned about how their children's health problems might affect their education. Asthma UK says that on average there are two children in every class with asthma. "Whilst a vast majority of schools take these issues seriously, it is clear some families have had poor experiences," says the statement from Mr Gove. "This new duty, underpinned by statutory guidance, will help schools to ensure that they are taking reasonable action to support children with medical conditions, where necessary." The change will be introduced as an amendment to the Children and Families Bill. The proposals say that although most schools already make provisions, this will set out a clear framework of expectations. This could include making an individual plan for a pupil. There will also be advice on storing medicines and emergency procedures. A statement from Diabetes UK says that while many schools provide excellent additional support, there are examples where children are "effectively excluded from fully participating in their education and hindered in meeting their full academic potential". Caroline Moore, the charity's director for planning and support services, said the announcement "has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of around a million children". Kay Boycott, chief executive of Asthma UK, said: "We can't overstate the importance of the government putting a duty on schools to support children with medical conditions. "On average, two children in every classroom in the UK are living with asthma and just a quarter of teachers say they would feel completely confident knowing what to do if a pupil had an asthma attack. "This is putting children's lives at risk on a daily basis and needs to be urgently addressed by introducing individual care plans and training for teachers on implementing them as part of a medical conditions policy for every school." </body>

      <title>Consumer body to study universities</title>
      <description>The Office of Fair Trading has turned its attention to the university sector with plans to review students' consumer rights and university competition.</description>

      <body>The Office of Fair Trading has turned its attention to the university sector with plans to review students' consumer rights and university competition. The move follows concerns of inadequate regulation and variable teaching quality at institutions in England. The OFT has called for information from students, universities, regulators, government bodies and employers. It said choice between universities should "play a positive role in underpinning their success in future". OFT chief executive Clive Maxwell acknowledged that universities in England "enjoy an enviable reputation across the world". The review will focus on undergraduate higher education, particularly on whether recent changes aimed at giving students in England more choice and driving competition, have been effective. It defines university as including any provider of higher education courses. The review will look at whether the regulatory system is contributing to effective competition or undermining it. Earlier this month, a report criticised university regulation in England as inadequate in an era of higher student fees. The Higher Education Commission said that before higher fees were introduced last year, universities depended on teaching grants which came with regulatory conditions attached - but as the value of teaching grants falls and student fees rise, the ability to regulate universities through funding is also reduced. The OFT says it is particularly interested to hear how universities compete for students, how they deliver value for money and how they decide which courses to offer and how to deliver them. It will ask whether information from universities is adequate to help prospective students decide where and what to study, whether universities meet students' expectations and what they can do if they need to complain. In May, a report by the consumer group Which? and the Higher Education Policy Institute (HEPI) revealed big variations in teaching time, with students at some universities getting twice as much teaching as others doing the same subject elsewhere. It included a poll that found that almost one in three first-year students at UK universities felt their courses were not good value for money. Sonia Sodha, head of public services at Which?, said she hoped the OFT review would lead to an improvement in the quality of university courses. "Our comparisons with previous decades show that today's students are working for fewer hours, are set less work and are receiving less detailed feedback. "With increased tuition fees and a greater choice of universities and courses than ever before, it's essential that students can access better information about the academic experience on offer so they can see whether they are getting value for money." Toni Pearce, president of the National Union of Students, said: "It would be useful to have an external view of what is working well, and in the best interests of students, and what may need some reform. "We would be particularly interested to hear what the OFT finds on issues NUS has campaigned on over many years, such as student access to information, including full transparency on teaching arrangements, complaints procedures, and means of redress if and when things go wrong." Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of Universities UK, welcomed the review in the light of major changes to the sector. "It is still early days in terms of assessing how the changes are working, but universities have done a great deal already to increase the amount of available information on courses and to respond to feedback from students." </body>

      <body>A school is likely to remain closed for the rest of the week after ceiling damage, probably caused by heavy rain. The Grade II-listed Albert Primary in Penarth closed after loose plaster was found on two ceilings. Vale of Glamorgan council said the damage, thought to be the result of a water leak, was spotted on Monday. About 385 children attend the school, with another 72 in the nursery. The council said the ceilings would have to be made safe before re-opening. Councillor Chris Elmore, cabinet member for children's services, said: "Our officers think the damage has been the result of a water leak, probably caused by the extremely heavy rain we had over the weekend. "The damaged ceilings are over two halls, which lead to the classrooms. "My priority is the safety of the children and staff, so unfortunately we have to close the school while we make the ceilings safe. "We apologise to parents for the inconvenience and I will make sure our officers do everything they can to have the school open again as soon as possible." Parents have been told the school will probably remain closed this week, while next week is the half-term holiday. It said there is "no issue" with asbestos in the ceilings. The Victorian-era building closed temporarily for repairs last year. In December 2012, the school was closed down for emergency repairs to pipe work which required the floors being lifted up. </body>

      <body>There has been a warning that the number of educational psychologists in Scotland in dangerously low. A report from the Scottish National Steering Group of Educational Psychologists said nearly a quarter might retire in the next four years. It also said too few new trainees are being recruited. The steering group said it feared some councils could breach their statutory obligations on provision if the situation does not improve. The Scottish government said its committed to giving children with additional support needs the assistance they need. Educational psychologists are employed to help tackle inequalities and improve the life chances of children with additional support needs and their families. The steering group's report said the number of pupils identified as having additional support needs nearly trebled between 2006 and 2011. Over the same period, national funding for the training of educational psychologists was withdrawn and council budgets came under growing pressure. The report said that these three factors have put delivery of services in schools and communities under significant pressure. It claimed a postcode lottery exists and that people in some areas have less access to educational psychologists, potentially putting them at risk. Nearly 25% of Scottish educational psychologists are eligible to retire in the next four years, while the number of students training for the profession has dropped. The steering group said it feared some local authorities may breach their statutory responsibilities to provide services that contribute towards the support and development of children and young people. Roger Barrow, chairman of the Association of Scottish Principal Educational Psychologists, said the government needed to give councils clear guidance on how many educational psychologists they should have. He said: "Educational psychologists play a crucial role in supporting vulnerable children and young people and contribute towards health and wellbeing and curricular initiatives, a role that is acknowledged by HM Inspectorate of Education in their 2011 Aspect Report and in a 2012 report from the education committee of the Scottish Parliament." "However increased demand for services, cuts to local authority budgets and the withdrawal of funding for the training of educational psychologists place the profession close to a tipping point." "A number of local authorities have been unable to employ a sufficient number of educational psychologists, and, unless national steps are taken to secure the workforce supply, then we are likely to see looked after children and those with additional support needs lose out on the core services that they need." He added: "The Scottish government needs to provide clear guidance to local authorities about the number of educational psychologists required per head of population to safeguard an effective level of service for all our children and young people." A Scottish government spokesman said: "While it is up to each local authority to identify and meet this demand, the Scottish government continues to monitor the delivery of this support through the National Scottish Steering Group for Educational Psychologists." </body>

      <title>Youngsters taking 'risks' online</title>
      <description>Many nine-to-11-year-old children are indulging in 'very risky behaviour online', a web safety survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Many children aged nine to 11 are indulging in very risky behaviour online, suggests a survey. Many are sharing personal information and playing games rated for much older children, found the survey drawn up by the ISC2 IT security education group. In addition, 18% of the 1,162 children queried said they had arranged offline meetings with friends made via the web. Meanwhile, a second survey suggests 55% of young people in England accept cyberbullying as part of everyday life. Security experts have urged parents to help their offspring stay safe by being more involved with what they do online. "[Many] primary school children know far more about the internet than their parents do," said Tim Wilson, an information security worker who carried out the survey for the ISC2 organisation which helps schools educate children about web safety. In total, 15 schools in south-east London, Kent and Guernsey took part in the survey. "Youngsters actually participate in a lot of risky behaviours that I don't believe the parents know about," he said. "Not because of any ill will on behalf of the parents, it's just that the parents do not understand technology." The survey exposed the amount of time that younger children were spending online and what they got up to. It found that 43% went online every day and 46% spent more than two hours each time they browsed. Many (22%) regularly used it after 21:00 and a small percentage, 7%, were still online after midnight. Some reported that their concentration in class had suffered as a result of their late night activity. The most popular online activities were playing video games (23%), using social networks (18%) and watching videos (17%). Of the 19% who said they played war games online, a significant number said they played age inappropriate titles such as the 18-rated Black Ops and Modern Warfare. The time children spent online and the activities they indulged in was putting them at risk, said Mr Wilson. A significant proportion of children who answered the survey, 18%, said they had met in real life friends they had made online. Although a majority took along an adult or older sibling to these meetings, a third said they just went along with friends. Dr Elizabeth Staksrud, from Oslo University, an expert on children's use of the web who advises the EU Kids Online project, said most face-face meetings with online friends were positive experiences for children. "It's rare that such meetings are associated with abuse," she said, adding the caveat that parents often did not know that such a meeting had taken place. However, she added that, in a small number of cases where grooming was taking place, it was often not immediately apparent to a child that their online friends could present a threat. Mr Wilson echoed this comment and said younger children were not applying the real world rules that kept them safe, such as being wary of strangers, when they went online. "They are very knowledgeable but they do not have the adult life skills to understand what is risky ," he said. Nickie Forrest, head teacher at Normandy Primary School in Bexley, said parents should be doing more to help their children understand the risks and stay safe. "Parents have to start taking responsibility for a world perhaps that they don't understand," said Ms Forrest. In the second survey, commissioned by the Anti-Bullying Alliance, 60.5% of parents said that cyberbullying had become part of life for children and young people. But 40% of parents and 44% of the teachers surveyed acknowledged that they did not know how to respond to cyberbullying. The survey of 2,200 parents, children and teachers across England revealed growing calls for online safety to be taught in more schools, with 69% of teachers and 40% of young people saying it should be included in the national curriculum. Luke Roberts, national co-ordinator of the Anti-Bullying Alliance, said cyberbullying is one of the biggest issues facing young people today and called for the government, parents and social networking sites to come together to teach young people how to stay safe online. "We need a collaborative approach to tackling cyberbullying, so children themselves can take responsibility for their own safety online and know where to turn for help when things go wrong," he said. </body>

Following the Kickstarter model used to raise capital for business ideas, they are trying to persuade people that their cause is worth supporting. Ackeem Ngwenya owes London's Royal College of Art over Â£20,000, and he can only graduate once the tuition fees are paid. So in desperation he has started a campaign on a crowdfunding website. His graduation design project is informed by his childhood growing up in a Malawian rural community, where he had to carry corn for miles each day on terrible roads. Ackeem has developed a wheel that can be manually adapted to suit different terrains. But will he reach his target, and develop the project which has become his obsession?

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naÃ¯ve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <title>Union 'embraces' Ineos survival plan</title>
      <description>Union leaders voice optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant.</description>

      <body>Union leaders have voiced optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant. The Unite union said it had decided to "embrace" a survival plan put forward by owner Ineos, "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs when Ineos announced the closure on Wednesday. Workers had rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Speaking after the talks, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Before the meeting, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union Unite would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Unite remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that Ineos would reverse its decision. The company had previously said that while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael are expected to hold talks at Grangemouth on Thursday afternoon. Mr Swinney had earlier said that he hoped the talks between the management and union leaders would be "constructive and successful" He said: "I hope that at this very, very, very late stage in the process there is a willingness to listen to and to consider the proposals being put forward. "Everybody is agreed that this plant has a strong future with the necessary investment and that is why the Scottish government is willing to be a player in that." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest Â£300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that Â£300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <body>A man who repeatedly raped a nine-year-old girl has been jailed for five years and four months. Paul Barrett, 44, from Inverness, abused the child at an address in Cannich in the Highlands between 1 April 2012 and 17 February this year. The High Court in Edinburgh heard how Barrett forced the child to participate in sexual acts with him. He pleaded guilty to a rape charge at the High Court last month. Sentence had been deferred for reports. Defence advocate Shahid Latif told the court that Barrett was sorry for his conduct and had fully co-operated with the police and prosecutors. Mr Latif added: "Nothing can be said to justify or mitigate a crime of this nature. "Mr Barrett is an individual who has realised the devastation of what he has done." Passing sentence Lord Pentland described Barrett as "cruel, devious and manipulative". He added: "Society has a complete abhorrence towards crimes of this nature and it is the responsibility of the courts to reflect that and to deter others who may be persuaded to commit crimes of this type." </body>

      <body>A 24-year-old man from Arnol on Lewis has been accused of operating a slaughterhouse in a barn on his family's croft as a business. Norman Campbell is charged with breaking food hygiene regulations. Stornoway Sheriff Court heard that the Scottish SPCA, acting on a tip-off, found 32 carcasses and 77 sheep heads at the property in November 2011. Mr Campbell denies running a slaughtering business and maintains the meat was for his family's consumption. He has pleaded not guilty to seven charges. Four of the charges are under the food hygiene act and three under the prevention of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies regulations. Colm Fraser, Comhairle nan Eilean Siar's head of environmental health, told the court he was convinced that such a volume of meat could not be for personal consumption. He added that the premises was a long way from being compliant with food safety regulations. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>A new Scottish company is to create at least 600 jobs over three years from its base in North Lanarkshire. Ascensos is creating the contact centre jobs in Motherwell on the site of the former Lloyds Banking Group premises which closed earlier this year. The company has said there could be more than 1,000 jobs over the next five years. Finance Secretary John Swinney said it was a "great boost" for employment in the area. Mr Swinney added: "I also recognise the company's commitment to employing those returning to work after a period of leave and those made redundant. "By occupying the former Lloyds Banking Group premises, Ascensos will bring a currently empty site back to life." Ascensos, created by former beCogent executives, has benefited from a grant of Â£1.8m from Scottish Enterprise. Managing director John Devlin said: "We want to create high-quality, long-term jobs in what is an area with tremendous skills availability. "Our experience in building a client-focused business with highly-engaged employees will prove invaluable. "In terms of roles created, our focus is not just on youth employment as we will also be looking to retrain and develop our people skills across the spectrum, including return-to-work mums and those affected by redundancy over recent years. "We want the very best people to play a big part in our success." The Motherwell centre is to be initially launched with 100 jobs and job numbers will increase as more new projects and clients come on board. Mr Devlin added: "We are in discussion with a number of top-name clients in the retail and e-commerce sectors. "As we develop ,we will become one of the largest employers in the area and our plan is to eventually diversify geographically and create more jobs in other areas of the UK." Councillor David Fagan, convener of regeneration for North Lanarkshire Council, said: "It's great news that Ascensos is going to be based in Motherwell. "I've been really impressed with their plans and that they have chosen Motherwell is a real endorsement of the town and North Lanarkshire as a great place to do business. "We will help in any way we can to help deliver Ascensos' aim of building a cutting-edge business. Creating jobs in North Lanarkshire is our number one priority and we really look forward to working with the team." </body>

      <title>Rent arrears up since benefit reform</title>
      <description>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study.</description>

      <body>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study. The Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR), has published research on the early impact of the measure, which has been dubbed the bedroom tax by critics. It said arrears increased by Â£789,000 in the period to the end of June 2013. It comes against a background of rising arrears in the past two years. SHR said the report, based on feedback from almost 85% of social landlords, gave the fullest available picture of the early effects of welfare reform on Scottish landlords' rent arrears. Iain Muirhead, the regulator's director of strategy and communications, said: "We want to get more information and see a fuller picture before we would draw any firm conclusions on what is happening and why. "Our research establishes a baseline and we will repeat it each quarter and report the findings." But the Early Impacts of Welfare Reform report revealed that the level of arrears had reduced during the period between March and June in each of the previous two years. In 2011 it fell by Â£3.5m and by Â£2.8m in 2012. The report said the total amount owed in rent at 30 June 2013 was Â£63,125,355, although this included amounts carried over from previous years. It said most landlords were facing the same problems in dealing with the effects of welfare reform. They identified increased workload and income reduction as their two biggest challenges. Support, advice and information to tenants featured prominently in the actions landlords were taking to address the early impact. David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the report provided concrete evidence of a worrying trend. "This heralds tough times ahead for Scottish social landlords - be they housing associations, co-operatives or local authorities - as they face the twin challenges of increasing service delivery costs and reducing income. "Both of these challenges arise directly from welfare reform." The benefit changes form part of a revamped system. Under the new housing rules, 14% will be deducted from housing benefit for one "spare" bedroom and a quarter for two or more. The government says the changes should ensure that people are in suitably sized accommodation and release larger accommodation for people who need it. </body>

      <body>Six of Edinburgh's 13 licensed saunas are to close after the city council refused to grant licences. The Licensing Sub Committee assessed information on the saunas, including reports from the police and objectors. A submission by Police Scotland, calling for a ban on items of a sexual nature in saunas, was withdrawn without any discussion. Safe sex campaigners were angered by condition, which they said would mean a ban on condoms in the city's saunas. After the meeting, committee convener Councillor Gavin Barrie said: "The committee has carefully reviewed all the information presented, including information from any objectors and reports from Police Scotland. "Each application was considered on its individual merits and of the 13 Public Entertainment licences that were considered today, seven have been renewed." Earlier this year, six saunas had their licences suspended following raids across Edinburgh. NHS Lothian supplies 130,000 free condoms to Edinburgh's licensed saunas every year. Safe sex campaigners feared the police's original recommendations would have led to a ban on condoms in saunas. Nadine Stott, a board member of the charity Scot-Pep, which campaigns for the rights of sex workers, said such a move would have "gone against all basic common sense". And Supt Matt Richards stressed that Police Scotland did not advocate the banning of condoms. He said: "At no point do the recommendations make reference to the banning of condoms. Police Scotland absolutely supports proper measures to protect sexual health. "The issue of prostitution is a complex one and we work with the City of Edinburgh Council and local health services to ensure the safety of those involved in the sex trade." He said it was up to the council's regulatory committee to decide which conditions were applied. "We will continue to adopt a practical and positive stance towards harm reduction working with our partners in the health service local authority and third sector," he said. </body>

      <body>Scottish wine merchant Inverarity Morton (IM) has bought Forth Wines for a seven-figure sum. The announcement comes two years after WM Morton's merger with Inverarity Vaults, which led to IM becoming Scotland's largest privately-owned drinks distributor. IM already supplies more than 2,000 customers in the licensed trade sector. The enlarged company will have a combined turnover of about Â£75m with a workforce of more than 200. Stephen Russell, IM's managing director, said: "There were a number of factors that attracted us to Forth Wines. "Over the last three years, the directors have helped steer the business on a strong growth path and they now occupy a premium space in the market. "Volume-wise, they sell about as much wine as we do in a year and that's no small feat. Our wine portfolio is one of our biggest selling points and one we work tirelessly to ensure it remains unequalled on breadth, depth and value." He added that Forth Wines' site in Milnathort, which spans 75,000sq ft, would enhance the company's own distribution capability. "At the moment we handle all deliveries from our warehouse in Glasgow, which is already running at capacity," he said. "Having a second depot in Milnathort will make a big difference to our logistics operation by helping reduce road miles and improve delivery schedules. We will be far better placed to service customers throughout the whole of Scotland." For the first three months, the two companies will continue to run independently. Mr Russell said there would be no net job losses at Milnathort, but said there was a need to recruit in logistics to meet the increased distribution need. Forth Wine director Ian Cumming said: "This is great news for Forth Wines as it provides a platform within a Scottish-owned independent business to build on the successful growth we've achieved over the past three years since acquiring the company." Forth Wines employs 51 staff and increased year-on-year turnover in 2012 to Â£24m. Owned by the Bulloch family, WM Morton began trading in 1945. </body>

      <body>The Scottish poppy appeal has asked people to go without a small luxury and instead donate the money to support veterans. The 2013 campaign was launched by Craig and Charlie Reid from The Proclaimers in Edinburgh. Poppyscotland organises the country's largest charity street collection, with the money raised used to help ex-service members and their families. The money raised last year was down slightly at just under Â£2.6m. With increasing demand for the help they provide, the charity has asked the public to donate the money they would have spent on a coffee or a pizza to the campaign instead. Craig and Charlie Reid's grandfather died fighting in World War II. Craig Reid said: "Charlie and I are proud to launch the Scottish Poppy Appeal this year. "It's a cause we've always supported and one that means a lot to us. "Poppyscotland does a fantastic job in looking after ex-servicemen and women, and their families too." Poppyscotland's head of fundraising Colin Flinn said donations were put to good, practical use. He said: "Veterans can have to deal with a number of challenges after leaving the armed forces, from battlefield injuries, mental health problems or social isolation, to not finding the right house, job or knowing how to manage their finances. "But once someone joins the armed forces family they're always part of the family. "So, whether someone left the forces last week or 30 years ago, if they need help we need to be here." The Scottish Poppy Appeal runs until 11 November. </body>

      <body>Some of Britain's "richest areas" of rare mosses and liverworts are to be protected from hydro-electric schemes. Sunart Oakwoods' narrow wooded ravines and the warm climate of the west Highlands provide ideal conditions for the oceanic bryophytes. Some of this plant life is found no where else in Europe. Scottish Natural Heritage has created an online tool to help developers avoid prime bryophytes habitat. Burns in the area could be suitable for hydro-electric production. Parts of the woodland has European-recognised protection. However, a survey of the area has found rich growths of rare mosses and liverworts at locations beyond the boundaries of the Special Area of Conservation. Renewable power companies will be discouraged from choosing such areas for hydro projects. Sunart Oakwoods are the remnants of a type of ancient habitat that once extended along the length of Europe's Atlantic coastline as far as Portugal. People have used the forests along Loch Sunart since the Bronze Age. In the 18th and 19th Centuries, trees were used for making charcoal. But, large parts of the woods and sensitive habitats within them have survived because local communities managed the trees sustainably. SNH commissioned a survey of the area to aid work in creating an online map to help guide renewable energy firms. Between August 2012 and February this year, 104 burns were assessed. A total of 30 were deemed to be internationally or nationally important in terms of the plant life found, SNH said. The agency said that meant 71% of the burns studied could potentially be used for electricity generation. Dr David Genney, SNH's bryophyte specialist, said: "Scotland has around 920 species of bryophytes, many of which are globally rare. "That makes it especially important for us to look after as many of them as possible to preserve part of our national biodiversity for future generations." He added: "Scotland requires clean, green energy, and hydro schemes can provide this. "Our planning tool on our website allows energy operators to avoid development in places that may cause unintended damage to internationally important plant communities." Researchers surveying the sites also discovered a liverwort species called Holt's Scalewort, which had not previously been found in the UK. Dr Lorraine Servant, survey project manager, said: "This work has highlighted the richness and diversity of mosses and liverworts in the Sunart ravines. "It has provided valuable information needed to inform our advice on micro hydro schemes proposals, and will also help guide management measures to conserve these species." The survey report said some parts of Sunart Oakwoods represented the "creme-de-la-creme of bryologically rich sites" in the UK. It added that the area was one of the most important sites for biodiversity in the UK. </body>

      <body>An independent investigation has made three recommendations to Police Scotland for the way they handle missing person inquiries. It follows an incident where a man with mental health issues fell seven floors from a block of flats in Leith shortly after officers had taken him home. They had found him wandering several miles away in the Torphin Bank area. The man, 39, sustained serious injuries in the incident last June, and is still in hospital. He fell from the block of flats 90 minutes after he had been returned to his home with police. Prof John McNeill, the independent Police Investigations and Review Commissioner, said in the previous four days officers had what is described as "direct and indirect" contact with the man, who had a history of psychiatric illness. However, that information had not been passed to officers who found the man and who decided he was simply lost and drove him home. Prof McNeill has called for a review of the way missing person inquiries are handled, in particular how information held by police systems is passed to operational officers to assist their decision making. Prof McNeill said: "It is essential that information held in police systems and otherwise available to police staff is accurately recorded and provided to front line officers when attending calls. This is particularly relevant in the response to incident reports concerning vulnerable persons. "Furthermore, leaving a person who presented with mental health issues alone at their home, in the absence of an appropriate adult to care for their welfare, does not constitute leaving them in a place of safety." </body>

      <body>Late-night shoppers will be able to park their cars for free in Edinburgh city centre in the run up to Christmas. Edinburgh City Council is again waiving parking charges from 17:00 between 2 and 28 December in a bid to attract shoppers to Princes Street. Alive after Five also encourages shops in the area to remain open until 19:00 during the festive period. It is the second year running that the scheme has been in place leading up to Christmas. Lesley Hinds, Edinburgh city Council's transport convener, said: "The Christmas shopping period is the busiest time of the year for retailers and we want to encourage facilities to remain open for longer to make the most of this. "We have agreed with Marketing Edinburgh and Essential Edinburgh to continue with free evening parking this year as part of Alive after Five as it is popular with shoppers at Christmas and those wanting to take advantage of some of the fantastic new attractions that make up this year's Edinburgh's Christmas.

      <body>New sites - including the Mary Rose museum in Portsmouth - have been added to a Battle of Flodden ecomuseum. The latest additions include churches, bridges, castles and museums at locations as far apart as Suffolk, Manchester and Galloway. The ecomuseum brings together places with links to the battle, to "preserve the heritage and traditions of communities around a central theme". There are now 41 sites included, mostly in Northumberland and the Borders. Many of them are in the Tweed Valley across the Scotland-England border where the battle took place in 1513. It involved the Scots army of King James IV and an English army commanded by Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey. It ended in defeat for the Scottish forces, with about 10,000 lives lost, including that of the King himself. English casualties are estimated to have been between 1,500 and 4,000. A plaque is being put in place at the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth to mark its links. The Mary Rose played a significant part in the battle. The ship was Thomas Howard's flag carrier and delivered him and approximately 1,000 troops and sailors to join the English army in Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Rear Admiral John Lippiett, chief executive of the Mary Rose Trust, said: "We are delighted to strengthen our association with Flodden and wish them every success in this important year." Lord Joicey, director of the Flodden 1513 Ecomuseum and on whose land the battlefield lies, welcomed the expansion of sites. "We're delighted to have such a diverse and extensive range of new ecomuseum sites which all help to remember the Battle of Flodden and to educate and inform people about its role in our shared English and Scottish history," he said. "The first task of the Flodden 1513 Ecomuseum was to co-ordinate events leading up to 9 September, the 500th anniversary of the battle itself. "Now our focus is on building and strengthening the community-owned heritage network, where memories, cultures, traditions and history are protected and shared with local people and visitors." </body>

      <body>A security guard charged with murdering a woman with a fire extinguisher at Glasgow's SECC complex has said that he has no memory of the attack. Clive Carter made the claim while giving evidence at his trial at the High Court in Glasgow. The 35-year-old has denied murdering conference delegate Khanokporn Satjawat, 42, from Thailand, at the Clyde Auditorium on 12 November 2012. He has admitted killing her while suffering diminished responsibility. Mrs Satjawat died while attending a conference for HIV drug therapy at the Clyde Auditorium, which is part of the SECC complex. She sustained massive head and facial injuries after being battered with a fire extinguisher in a female toilet. The court was heard how Mrs Satjawat's blood was found on Carter's trousers, and on the sleeve of his work blazer and cuffs of his shirt. His DNA was also found on the sleeve of the jumper Mrs Satjawat was wearing. Carter, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was working as a security guard at the venue at the time of the incident. Giving evidence, father-of-three Carter told defence QC Ian Duguid that he had a row with Mrs Satjawat when she asked why she should show her security pass. Carter said he had gone up to the second floor after hearing a noise. He was heading back down towards the fire stairs when he saw Mrs Satjawat. He said she kept asking why she had to show him her security pass and this made him "angry, frustrated and annoyed". Mr Duguid said: "Your emotions at the time were that she should just die is that correct," and Carter replied: "Yes." He added: "When I was asked about the incident by psychiatrists and psychologists I remembered the argument and I remember saying 'Die, just die' in my head. I didn't say it." Cater told the jury: "I just basically asked do you have your badge. She said: 'Of course.' "She started to get a bit angry about it. I wasn't sure what the problem was. She asked me why. I had a problem understanding what she was saying. Basically she was saying: 'Why do I have to show my badge.' "She said: 'Why is everyone having a go at me,' and I said: 'I just have to see your badge.' "We had a heated debate, an argument. Basically she was asking these questions. I just wanted to see her pass. She was having a go at me. I couldn't understand what she was saying. A lot of it was in broken English." Carter said that after arguing for a couple of minutes Mrs Satjawat pulled out her pass and waved it in his face. After killing her he went on his lunch break and was in the rest room when a colleague said there had been an incident in the ladies toilets. Carter said when he went up he saw Mrs Satjawat lying dead in a cubicle. He was asked how he felt and said: "Shocked, dizzy. I was mortified by the sight of the lady in question." He denied that he had tried to cover up what he had done by hiding his bloodstained blazer and trying to wash blood off the fire extinguisher. Carter also denied having a fascination with fire extinguishers. He was asked by Mr Duguid: "You accept you are responsible for the death of this lady how do you feel about that?" The accused replied: "I hate myself. I still struggle to understand and explain what happened. It doesn't make sense to me. In my own head there's no possible reason for what I did." Carter was then asked if he could think of a reason for what he did and said: "No not really. I know we had an argument, but that was no reason to do what I did." The court heard that Carter had been prescribed anti-depressants by his GP, but was not taking them. He was also attending anger management counselling. Carter admits killing Mrs Satjawat, but denies murdering her claiming diminished responsibility. He claims that he was tired because of the shifts he was working from G4S and said that he had only had two-and-a-half hours sleep before heading for his shift on 12 November 2012. In the two days previously he had worked 24 hours. The trial before Lord Matthews continues. </body>

      <body>Police and Uefa are investigating scenes of disorder by Ajax fans during their team's Champions League match against Celtic on Tuesday. Trouble flared in the away supporters section after Celtic took a one goal lead in the match which they won 2-1. Police Scotland said they were reviewing CCTV images and would liaise with their Dutch counterparts. Meanwhile, Uefa confirmed that it had opened disciplinary proceedings against Ajax over the scenes of disorder. There were reports that some Ajax fans ripped out seats and threw them after Celtic's first goal. It is also alleged that some fans confronted stewards and police. Police Scotland said: "A full investigation is being carried out into the behaviour of a number of Dutch supporters. "Our officers are reviewing CCTV images. Any information gleaned will be shared with our Dutch counterparts to identify those involved." Police Scotland confirmed no Dutch fans were arrested during the game. Uefa - European football's governing body - said it had decided to take action against Ajax. A spokesman said: "Disciplinary proceedings have been opened against AFC Ajax for crowd disturbances and throwing of objects at last night's Uefa Champions League match in Glasgow against Celtic FC. "The case will be dealt with by the Uefa control and disciplinary body on 21 November." </body>

      <body>A badger was snared and beaten to death and then left on a footpath in Inverness, the Scottish SPCA has said. The animal welfare charity said the badger was found by two women on a footpath in the Inshes area of the city on 30 September. A post mortem examination has shown that it was snared using baler twine and killed with a heavy blow to the head with a blunt instrument. The SSPCA said the animal was killed illegally. Gill MacGregor, a senior inspector at the charity, has appealed for help from the public in finding out who set the snare. She said: "This is a very unusual incident as it appears that the badger was deliberately killed and then placed on what is a very busy footpath, possibly with the intention of it being discovered. "We have been advised there are no known badger setts in the area so this rules out the possibility that the badger crawled there or was killed at the location where it was found." Ms MacGregor added: "The injuries the badger sustained were horrendous and this was an incredibly cruel act." </body>

      <body>Plans for a new secondary school in Aberdeen to replace Torry Academy and Kincorth Academy are set to proceed. It follows the Scottish government's decision not to call in the closure plans for further investigation. Aberdeen City Council's proposal is to build a new replacement Â£30m school on the Bobby Calder Park site. The council's education, culture and sport convener Jenny Laing said: "We need a school that is fit for purpose in the 21st century." The aim is for the new school - for up to 1,450 pupils - to open in the school session 2016-17. A Scottish government spokesman confirmed: "Local authorities are responsible for decisions on the school estate within their area and Scottish ministers may only call in a school closure decision for investigation if there is evidence to suggest a failing of an authority's statutory obligations. "In respect of this decision no such evidence was found. "Ministers are grateful to those who made representations on the issue and have sought assurances from the council that there will be further engagement with interested parties to work through the concerns that have been raised." </body>

Scottish Borders Council has agreed to provide salt bins to community councils who have signed up for the authority's Resilient Communities Initiative. Cuts to the region's "primary network" led to concerns in some rural areas. Councillor Gordon Edgar said the grit bin strategy could pay off for areas willing to get involved. "It is part of the resilience plan, if you like, that communities can become involved and take part in their own safety," he explained. "The provision of equipment is from the council and within their resilience plan they will have set up a procedure so they can use the equipment to their best benefit. "Some of the community councils are very active in providing services for their communities and these are the ones we are targeting to begin with." </body>

      <body>A man who stabbed a former soldier to death in Stirlingshire has been convicted of culpable homicide. George Rogerson, 22, of Plean, admitted stabbing Leon Cairney 11 times in the village last December after the pair rowed in the street in the early hours. He told the High Court in Dundee he had been provoked into the attack on the 25-year-old. Judge Lord Kinclaven deferred sentence until November 20 and Rogerson was remanded in custody. Rogerson had earlier tried to plead guilty to the lesser crime of culpable homicide, a plea rejected by the Crown. He then went on trial accused of murder at the High Court in Dundee - a charge he denied. The jury was told how Rogerson had rowed with neighbour Simon Blair, who had then called on Mr Cairney to help confront Rogerson. Giving evidence in his own defence, Rogerson said he had grabbed a kitchen knife from a block and stormed out the back door during the incident. He said: "I went out to the side of the house - I opened the side gate and when I did that they came flying in. "It was Leon Cairney and Simon Blair - I recognised them both. "I had the knife in my right hand. We started fighting and he was hitting me on the side of the head and I started stabbing him. "It stopped when he let me go and fell backwards." The court earlier heard from a pathologist that Mr Cairney had been stabbed 11 times - including four in the chest and one in the abdomen that had penetrated up to the hilt of the knife. Rogerson said he had "panicked" by going outside with the knife. A jury of eight men and seven women took two hours and 50 minutes to find him guilty of culpable homicide. </body>

      <title>Man fined for stun gun possession</title>
      <description>Callum Flood, of Dundee, is fined Â£1,500 after being caught with a stun gun disguised as a mobile phone.</description>

      <body>A man who was caught by police with a stun gun disguised as a mobile phone outside a party at a friend's house as been fined Â£1,500. Callum Flood, 24, from Dundee, bought the gun to play practical jokes on friends. At a previous hearing he had pled guilty to illegally possessing the firearm in May 2011. At the High Court in Edinburgh, judge Lord Brodie made the decision not to impose a custodial sentence. Under the Firearms Act, the offence carries a minimum of a five year prison sentence, as laid down by Parliament - unless exceptional circumstances are established. Lord Brodie decided to spare him prison because he was convinced that there were exceptional circumstances in the case. The court heard how Flood had been detained by police after they were called to a house in Dundee following an altercation. Flood was restrained and handcuffed and an officer asked him if he had anything which could cause harm, to which he replied: "No". He was searched and an item that appeared to be a mobile phone was found in a pocket of his jeans, but an onlooker called out that it was a taser. At an earlier hearing, Lord Brodie said: "The policy here is that people are to be deterred from possessing firearms or any weapon which can be regarded as a firearm. "In the current case I have come to the conclusion that exceptional circumstances do exist. "In particular I have had regard to the fact that this was a non lethal weapon. It is a harmful weapon but the harm it can achieve is limited. "Your intention which I accept, was to use it as a means of carrying out practical jokes and indeed you had tested it already on yourself." Lord Brodie said he also accepted that Flood did not understand that possessing the weapon was unlawful. He added: "On the evidence before me it would appear the period you possessed it was short." He said he took into account that there was no device for recharging the electric shock weapon and that Flood said he did not intend to use it for criminal purposes." The judge said he would defer sentence on Flood for a year. Flood, who had been drinking, had been at a party at a friend's house before heading to his girlfriend's home had said: "I thought it was a toy. I just bought it from a friend as I was leaving the party. I thought it would be a good practical joke." His defence solicitor advocate Iain Paterson urged Lord Brodie not to jail his client. Lord Brodie agreed and ordered the fine to be paid within the year. </body>

      <body>The number of people killed on roads has fallen by 6% according to new Scottish government figures. The 2012 figures show the number of road casualties have decreased by 1% on last year and down 34% since 2002. The number of people killed due to drink-drive accidents has also fallen by 43% since 2001. Causalities to cyclists have risen by 9% in comparison to 2011, according to the figures. Transport Minister Keith Brown said: "The latest data confirms road casualties in Scotland are at their lowest level since records began. There is much that is good news in these figures but in some respects we still have a long way to go. He added: "The Scottish Government has invested over Â£58 million in cycling infrastructure, cycle training and road safety messages. "We will continue to work with our road safety partners to try to enable cyclists to use Scotland's roads safety. "In addition to the funding from this spending review period, Â£20 million has also been allocated to cycle infrastructure over the next two years to enhance the Community Links programme run by Sustrans Scotland which will be matched by local authorities. Supt Iain Murray, head of road policing at Police Scotland, said: "It is heartening to see such significant reductions in statistics, but it is important to recognise the tragedy that still lies behind the numbers. There is still a lot of work to be done. The figures supersede the provisional road injury and casualties statistics published in June. </body>

      <body>Further talks are to take place after members of Scotland's largest teaching union rejected planned changes to working conditions. EIS members voted against the offer by a margin of almost 3-2. At a meeting between the union and employers all sides agreed to consider their positions and hold more discussions soon. The proposed changes were designed to make teachers' conditions of employment more flexible. For instance a teacher might be expected to spend two hours more with students one week but do two hours less the next to balance this out. Changes were also proposed to the list of things which are, and are not, the responsibility of teachers. The EIS had anticipated that the current pay offer for teachers would be withdrawn if the changes to conditions were rejected. This has not yet happened. A spokesman for council umbrella body Cosla said: "Our position has not changed. The deal as presented to the teachers' unions remains on the table. "All three sides - the unions, Scottish government and Cosla have agreed to meet again in November." The Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers is made up of representatives of teachers' unions, councils and the Scottish government. The teachers' side stated that teachers were prepared to accept the two year pay deal, changes to pay and arrangements for short term supply teachers and to participate in a working group to consider supply teacher availability. But they said they were not prepared to conclude agreement on the proposed changes to the duties, working hours and working week of teachers. </body>

      <body>Scotland's textile industry has set new growth goals after exceeding targets it had originally hoped to reach in seven years' time. Finance Secretary John Swinney made the announcement during a summit in the Scottish Borders. A 2011 Textiles Industry Strategy aimed to increase turnover to Â£846m by 2020 but it now stands at Â£950m. It has prompted a revised target for taking turnover to between Â£1.2bn and Â£1.5bn by 2020. Mr Swinney said: "The textile industry has made and continues to make a massive contribution to the economy. "Today's figures show the huge demand the sector has in markets across the world and the success of the industry. "The Scottish government and its agencies are committed to helping the sector make the most of the estimated Â£81bn global market." He also announced that Â£120,000 via Skills Development Scotland (SDS) has been awarded to the Scottish Textiles and Leather Association. It will be used for a range of initiatives including introducing a Certificate of Work Readiness for 16 to 22-year-olds seeking their first experience of work in textiles. David Martin of SDS said: "This funding will help the Scottish textiles industry develop and will also ensure there's an increase in opportunities for young people and new entrants looking to join the industry. "There's huge potential for the textiles industry to expand in Scotland. "SDS is delighted to be playing a part in that growth by working in partnership to ensure the skills are in place for future development." Head of textiles at Scottish Enterprise, Cathy Black, said the rise in turnover was testament to the "ambitious and innovative" nature of textile companies. "In 2013 alone, we have supported over 40 companies to participate in leading international events such as Chic in China, Decorex in London and, in November, six rail interior companies will visit Cologne to exhibit at the Railway Interior Expo," she said. "It's opportunities like these as well as the sector's strong heritage and world-class reputation in design and excellence, that help to support the sector's ambitious target to increase exports by 50% by 2017 and contribute to its wider economic growth. "Working together with our partners and stakeholders we are committed to helping grow this important sector to Scotland." </body>

Online accounted for 13.2% of its total sales. Chief executive Michael Sharp said he was pleased with the results given the "very difficult conditions". He said he expected shoppers' incomes to stay under pressure, giving that price inflation growing ahead of wages. Mr Sharp added: "With this in mind, we remain cautious about the strength and pace of any consumer recovery in 2014 and expect the marketplace to remain highly competitive." Debenhams said it would open four more stores in the UK in 2014. </body>

      <body>The multinational chemical firm BASF is to close its plant in Renfrewshire with the loss of 141 jobs. The site, at Hawkhead Road in Paisley, has produced pigments to colour paints, paper and plastics for almost 60 years. BASF said the plant was "not cost competitive" in a "rapidly changing market" and the closure was part of restructuring to its global operations. The plant was originally run by Swiss firm Ciba before being taken over by BASF as part of a Â£3bn buyout in 2008. BASF made 232 workers redundant at the plant in 2010 as part of moves, which it said, were designed to safeguard its future. In a statement, BASF said the plant was no longer viable and consultations with trade union and staff representatives would begin this week. It added: "The Paisley site manufactures Azo pigments. The global market for these pigments is shrinking. "Increasing manufacturing capacities and the entry of new competitors have changed the business environment significantly. "The Paisley site, which BASF acquired in 2009, is not cost competitive. Restructuring programmes over the last three years have succeeded in reducing fixed costs, but the rapidly changing market situation resulted in unsustainable manufacturing cost at the site." The statement said that a large part of the products manufactured at the Paisley plant were used for printing - a sector which was now shrinking. The firm added: "BASF is adapting its Azo pigment business to these changed market conditions by restructuring measures, including consolidating production at cost competitive sites. "It will stop producing Azo pigments for the printing industry and focus on innovative products, mainly for the plastics industry." The Scottish government described the closure of the Paisley site as "a major concern" for staff and their families. Finance Secretary John Swinney said: "The Scottish government and our agencies will meet with the company as a matter of urgency to discuss options for the site. "In the meantime, we have offered support to BASF through our initiative for responding to redundancy situations, Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (Pace). "Through Pace, we will provide a tailored package of support for employees to minimise the time those individuals affected by redundancy are out of work." </body>

The Dutch-owned firm says AKG's report contains inaccuracies but declined to say what they were. Aegon, which has its UK base in Edinburgh, reported an Â£11m loss for the second quarter of 2013. The firm has reduced its workforce as part of major restructuring which cost Aegon Â£27m in the second quarter. It has closed sales offices in Glasgow, London, Guildford, Birmingham, Manchester and Bristol. An Aegon spokesman said: "We consider this report to be inaccurate and we do not believe the interpretation given on publicly available data truly reflects the position of Aegon UK. "We have been speaking to AKG since August and have pointed out some of these inaccuracies. We look forward to this open dialogue continuing." He added: "Aegon in the UK is part of the Aegon NV group - one of the world's largest and strongest insurance companies." It is rated A- by Standard and Poors, A3 by Moodys and A by Fitch. </body>

      <title>Collingwood eyes success with Scots</title>
      <description>Coach Paul Collingwood believes Scotland are in good shape as they prepare to qualify for two major tournaments.</description>

      <body>Paul Collingwood believes Scotland are in good shape as they prepare to qualify for two major tournaments. The 37-year-old Durham captain will assist the Scots in November's World Twenty20 campaign and for January's bid to reach the 2015 World Cup. "I've played against Scotland a number of times and there has always been talent in the side," said Collingwood. "It's about getting the best out of that ability and I'm really looking forward to the challenge." Collingwood, captain of England's 2010 World Twenty20 side, will work alongside head coach Pete Stiendl as Scotland set off for a pre-tournament warm-up in Sri Lanka. Scotland then begin the World Twenty20 qualifiers in the United Arab Emirates against Bermuda on 15 November, with Afghanistan, Nepal, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, Netherlands and Denmark making up Group B. The top six teams at the tournament will earn a place in the 2014 Twenty20 World Cup in Bangladesh. "With the games coming thick and fast, you need to recharge your batteries well," explained Collingwood, who played 68 Tests for England. "The lads will be training as hard as possible but you need to be careful between games on how much energy you are using up. "I'm sure once we get out there and get going it will be a good campaign for us. If you get off to a good start, you can get on a roll and really build momentum." January will see the Scots in New Zealand for the 2015 Cricket World Cup play-offs, with Ireland and Afghanistan having claimed the two spots from the World Cricket League. The Netherlands, UAE, Kenya, Namibia, Canada, Uganda, Hong Kong, Nepal and Papua New Guinea will be vying with Scotland for the two remaining places. "It's very exciting to be involved in World Cup qualifiers - it's the biggest prize in cricket for an associate team like Scotland," enthused Collingwood, who remains England's most capped one-day international player, with 197 appearances, and leading ODI run scorer. "Hopefully I can help prepare the boys to play the best they can and get some good results. "World Cups and qualifiers are pressured situations. There is a lot at stake. Hopefully the guys can go out there and relax and play their best cricket in a confident mood. "It's about putting the jigsaw together - getting everyone to play their part. "The mental side of things is the key and I'll be trying to pass on some of my experience, from playing for England to coaching Durham. "If you go out there and back your own ability, it's amazing how far you can take your game." Collingwood, who also has Indian Premier League experience, will be back at Durham for pre-season in February since he has another one-year playing deal to fulfil. "This is a short-term contract," he added. "I'm hopefully starting a coaching career here and it's a great opportunity. "The one thing I want to be part of is success for Scotland and it will be great if we can get the results out there." </body>

      <body>St Johnstone striker Stevie May has signed a one-year contract extension, tying him to the Perth club until 2015. The 20-year-old is Saints' top scorer this season with seven goals and English Championship side Peterborough United failed in two transfer bids for him in August. Saints manager Tommy Wright told the club's website: "We were always confident that the deal would be done. "There were a number of finer details that had to be ironed out." May's form earned him a Scotland Under 21 team call up and he netted his first goal at that level against Slovakia earlier this month. The Perth-born forward has been delighted to get his chance at McDiarmid Park this season after spending the previous two seasons out on loan. He scored 19 goals for Alloa in the 2011-12 campaign before netting 26 times for Hamilton Academical during the 2012-13 season. </body>

      <title>Kayal hopes for Celtic reinforcements</title>
      <description>Beram Kayal hopes players return from injury and suspension for Celtic before they face Ajax in Amsterdam.</description>

      <body>Beram Kayal is hoping Scott Brown and Kris Commons can play in the return game against Ajax despite scoring against the Dutch in their absence. Kayal's goal in the Champions League win was his first since May 2011. "I am so happy to score, but the important thing is the three points," said Kayal, given his start through Commons' injury and Brown's suspension. "I hope a few come back into the squad. We missed Scott and Kris. Brown is a great captain and Commons is magic." Celtic leapfrogged Ajax into third place in Group H, two points behind AC Milan, and next travel to Amsterdam Arena on 6 November. Commons could still be an injury doubt by then, while Brown will be suspended again unless Celtic win an appeal against his three-match ban. "I'm just back after four weeks out with a groin injury, but hopefully I can stay fit now and try to help the team as much as I can," added Kayal. "I'm so happy to be back and, when the gaffer asks me to do a job, I was glad to do it." Kayal thinks Celtic still have a chance of overtaking AC Milan to make the last 16 for a second year running. "In the last two games against Barcelona and AC Milan, we didn't get the points, but we are working hard as a team and it's a great win for us," said the Israel international. "We needed these three points, our first after three games, but the dream is still there. "We are just looking step-by-step, but it now gives us a good chance." James Forrest's penalty in first-half stoppage time put Celtic ahead against Frank de Boer's Amsterdam outfit before Kayal slotted home a second eight minutes into the second half with the help of a deflection. Forrest was made to wait as Ajax contested the penalty decision after Anthony Stokes was felled by Stefano Denswil, but the winger said he refused to be disturbed. "They were trying a wee bit of mind games, but that just made me concentrate more," the Scotland international told BBC Scotland. "I was a wee bit nervous, but it was good nerves and I was confident I was going to score. "That's only my second penalty for the first team, but I'm always happy to take them." The versatile Charlie Mulgrew said Celtic should now fear nobody in the competition but stressed: "It's just three points at home - we are not getting carried away." Celtic goalkeeper Fraser Forster was beaten by Lasse Schone's stoppage-time consolation goal but played down several fine saves before Kayal extended the home side's lead. "I made a few saves, but that's what I'm there to do and it's nice to make them," said the Englishman. "We have been unlucky in the first two games. We maybe had a little more luck, but we were clinical in front of goal, took our chances and we got the three points we deserved. "It'll be a different game away from home - but, if we play the way we did against Ajax and in Milan, we can go and pick up a result." </body>

      <body>Union leaders are meeting Ineos management later and have said they will offer concessions to try to save the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth in Scotland. The company said on Wednesday it would have to close the plant after workers there rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. John Hofmeister, a former president of Shell Oil and the author of Why We Hate the Oil Companies, told the Today programme's Sarah Montague the news of Grangemouth's closure did not come as a surprised. "By using Brent crude oil, the price of that crude coming into the plant for either chemicals or refining purposes - it is the most expensive crude that's out there, so Grangemouth faces a disadvantage in terms of crude oil relative to other refineries because of the higher price," he explained.

Owner Ineos claimed the decision had been forced by the refusal of workers to accept changed contracts. The company has yet to say when the neighbouring refinery will be started up again. One contractor at the site said: "A lot of subbies will lose their jobs now because Ineos will not take a pension cut." An Ineos employee told BBC News: "Some people are a bit annoyed, most people are just worried as it's nearly Christmas. That's the general consensus." </body>

      <title>Electric dreams: Life off the Grid</title>
      <description>Family lives life off the Grid</description>

      <body>In the shadow of a power line undergoing a Â£600m revamp is a family of six with no connection to the National Grid. A BBC documentary recorded a year in their lives. For 19 years the Pococks have lived off the electricity grid, on a croft at Cougie in Glen Affric in the Highlands. They are fiercely proud of where they live and about being self sufficient. The family grows its own food - they have two dairy cows, pigs, sheep, geese, ducks and hens. Mum Sasha, 36, runs a pony trekking business while her 42-year-old husband, Iain, supplements the household income by gathering and selling scrap metal. The couple's four children - Sarah, Ryan, Ewan and Douglas - help with the running of the croft and pitch in looking after the livestock and the trekking business's 19 horses. The effort to heat and light the crofthouse, however, dominates family life. The croft is not connected to the National Grid and the family gets its electricity from a generator and a small wind turbine. But when diesel levels are low and the wind does not blow, the TV and domestic appliances are out of action and the children have to do their homework by candlelight and head torches. With a lack of power comes great responsibility. Iain carries out regular maintenance to the diesel generator and wind turbine, while the children spend a cold and wet Saturday gathering firewood. Tonnes of timber are needed to keep the house warm in winter. Iain's mother, Val, also lives on the croft. She and her family moved from Cardiff to Cougie in 1962 seeking an alternative to city life. Sixty percent of her pension goes on paying for fuel. The Pococks say they cannot get grants to install a larger turbine or solar panels because the funding requires surplus power to be exported to the Grid. Ironically, the croft is close to a massive multi-million pound electricity project. Energy giant SSE is upgrading the 137-mile (220km) Beauly to Denny transmission circuit. The 400,000-volt line will triple the capacity of the existing system, and eventually transmit vast amounts of energy from planned renewable power schemes in the Highlands to central Scotland. Six hundred new towers are being built - a reduction of 200 on the existing number. However, some towers are taller and reach heights of 65m (213ft). Opponents to the upgrade have complained that the new towers will spoil mountain landscapes. The project is expected to be completed in 2014 at an estimated cost of Â£600m. Sasha says the upgraded line is a blot on the landscape and, in return for having to live with it, her family should get some help getting mains electricity. "We live here in a croft at the end of the glen in the middle of nowhere, and we love it," she says. "We chose to live here. It's a great place to raise a family." But while she and her family thrive in the glen's wild, wide open spaces, Sasha is desperate for a reliable source of power. Seeing work being done to the Beauly-Denny line only fuels her quest for it. Tending to a ewe and her young lambs on a hillside overlooking the croft, Sasha's eldest child Sarah admits some people frown at her family's lifestyle. She said: "One of my friends goes to me: 'Oi, you don't look like a hillbilly, but you live like one'. And I go 'yeah, I suppose you could say that, but we're not quite though'." For Sarah there is a big distraction from the family's electric dreams. She has left school for university and swapped Glen Affric's quiet dark nights for the bright lights of Edinburgh. Power to the Pococks; A year in the life of a crofting family is a Timeline Films production. It will be shown on Thursday on BBC Two Scotland from 21:00. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth dispute: The key players</title>
      <description>Who are the main players in the refinery dispute?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24640133</url>

      <body>There are five chief characters involved in the Grangemouth dispute. Who are they and what are their views? Sixty-year-old Jim Ratcliffe trained as a chemical engineer, before becoming an accountant and entrepreneur. Mr Ratcliffe is one of the 100 richest men in the the UK, according to the latest Sunday Times Rich List. Another rich list, by the US publication Forbes, has him in the dollar billionaire category, with a fortune of $1.1bn (Â£680m). A global businessman, the company he founded operates in 11 countries. His company is a private one, allowing him to keep a lower profile than public company heads and he is known to be publicity shy, rarely giving interviews. However, he did comment at the weekend, saying the fate of the Grangemouth was in the hands of its staff: "This is not a bluff. The clock is ticking. "Grangemouth could have a future but that is absolutely in the hands of the workers. If we go down the wrong road, then I'm afraid this story will not have a happy ending." Perhaps the key figure in the dispute, Stephen Deans, is the convener for Unite in Scotland. Unite started its industrial action earlier this month over what it says is the victimisation of Mr Deans, who has worked at the Ineos plant for more than 20 years. Ineos accused him of contravening company policies as part of his work as former chair of the Labour Party in Falkirk. He was suspended from Ineos in the summer in connection with his Labour Party activities, essentially accused of campaigning on work premises. His suspension soured labour relations between management and union members, a large number of whom were angry at his treatment. Mr Deans had recruited a number of Unite members from the Ineos workforce to the local Labour branch, where the selection of a new parliamentary candidate was taking place. His activities attracted the suspicion of Labour Party head office. An investigation into whether electoral rigging was taking place cleared Unite. Unite's Scottish Secretary Pat Rafferty has been at the heart of the story since the situation between the company and the union flared up in the summer. He headed the union's delegation during talks with the company at conciliation service Acas last week, which failed to find a solution to the dispute. He has accused the company of playing "Russian roulette" about closing down the site and claimed the company was holding its workforce hostage. Mr Rafferty sees the plant's future in the hands of a new owner, saying: "We do need a responsible owner... and we would support the Scottish government in that quest." Highly supportive of the workforce, Michael Connarty, the Falkirk East and Linlithgow MP, has called Mr Ratcliffe the "equivalent of a Russian oligarch". He has gone so far as to tell the House of Commons there may have been "some sort of collusion" between the government and Ineos to enable the company, he said, to "break the workforce". Mr Connarty, whose constituency includes Grangemouth, was a special needs teacher before becoming an MP in 1992. His concerns about Grangemouth were evident right from the start. He used his maiden speech in the House of Commons in May 1992 to raise concerns about strength of the petro-chemical industry at Grangemouth. Scotland's Finance Secretary John Swinney has been concerned for weeks about the situation at Grangemouth because of its importance to the Scottish economy. He says if the whole plant was to close it would have a "very significant effect and a damaging effect" on the nation and he is active in the search for a new owner for Ineos. He told the BBC: "I don't think it will come as any surprise to anyone that the government is looking for alternative options. "We have certainly had discussions with other players and the Scottish government will engage in any discussions that are helpful to ensure Grangemouth can continue." He did add though that government ownership was not an option, despite the company's importance to the Scottish economy. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Grangemouth - What now?</title>
      <description>Business editor Douglas Fraser examines the future for the site</description>

      <body>Owners Ineos have announced that the petrochemical plant at the giant Grangemouth complex in central Scotland is to close. The neighbouring refinery will remain open. About 800 people are directly employed by the petrochemical plant, with more employed as sub-contractors. Union leaders have now said they are prepared to make concessions to try to save the petrochemical plant and are due to meet company managers. What's the problem with the petro-chemical plant at Grangemouth? Grangemouth's petro-chemical plant has used the by-products from refining oil across the road at the refinery. That's been used to manufacture a wide range of products, including plastics and pharmaceuticals. The oil coming down the pipeline from the Forties network in the North Sea has less of the ethane content, meaning the petro-chemical plant has been operating at less than 60% of capacity. To source new gas 'feedstock', Ineos planned to import it from the US, where the shale gas boom has driven down prices. It said earlier this month that its 'survival plan' would require more than Â£300m of Ineos investment to re-equip the Forth Valley plant. The firm also said it would require government loan guarantees and big cuts in costs, primarily the pay and pensions of the refinery and petro-chemical plants' joint workforce of 1,370. Without that agreement, it said the petro-chemical plant would close by 2017. How has this industrial dispute led to closure? Unite, the trade union, started industrial action 16 days ago over a separate dispute involving alleged victimisation. It then gave notice of a 48-hour strike from Sunday to Tuesday. Management responded by shutting down the plant. There were talks last week at arbitration service Acas. They broke down, but the union withdrew its strike threat. Ineos moved swiftly to require staff to accept changes to their contracts. The union urged members not to accept but to demand a return to negotiations. Two-thirds of Unite members took that advice, or half of the total workforce. Ineos said on Wednesday morning that the union response led it to close the plant, much faster than it had previously indicated. Liquidators are to be appointed within a week. Could it have a future? There may still be value to the assets, though Ineos recently reduced its asset valuation from nearly Â£400m to zero, saying there is no realistic prospect of future profit. A liquidator could seek a buyer. What that buyer would require is necessary funds for re-equipping it. It would have to source the feedstock, probably from the USA. If Ineos figures are correct, it would also require a lower cost base, so similar problems of reduced pay and pensions could arise, without industrial relations tensions being resolved. Could it be nationalised? The Scottish government has become involved in trying to find a buyer for Grangemouth, ahead of the decision on petro-chemical closure. It hasn't ruled out the possibility of taking over the plant itself. Neither ministers nor the civil service have expertise in running a complex petro-chemical plant, and would have to appoint an operator, and pay for it. It would also have to find funds for investment, when its capital budget is already severely squeezed. If Ineos's figures are correct, the Scottish government would face losses for the foreseeable future. It would also have to address the industrial relations challenge. What future for the refinery? The finances of the neighbouring refinery have been helped by selling feedstock to the petro-chemical plant. Without that outlet for its by-product, it will have to flare off excess gas, losing income and raising issues about excessive emissions. It could seek to ship out its by-products, but transportation would raise costs, and would be in competition with American shipments. On them, Ineos says gas is available at quarter of the European price. Jim Ratcliffe, the boss of Ineos, has warned that if the petro-chemical plant closes, then it is likely to lead to the demise of the refinery as well. The refinery market is suffering from significant global over-capacity, with more new refineries being built in the Middle East and Asia. They are more efficient and better suited to modern demand patterns for diesel instead of the high petrol output for which older European refineries were designed. There have been several recent refinery closures across Europe, where owners have been unable to find buyers. The big oil producers have been exiting the market for both refining and petro-chemicals over recent years, because they get better return on their capital from focussing on upstream exploration and production. So the buyers for assets such as Grangemouth are more likely to be strategic investors, taking the long view. One of them could be PetroChina, which has 49.9% ownership of the refinery. (It's pointing out that the majority lies with Ineos, and therefore the decision on its future lies there too.) However, state-controlled PetroChina has made colossal losses on its refining in recent years, and its management are focussed on handling a major corruption scandal in China. </body>

The programme makers want to hear what you think about Higher and Further Education in Scotland. They also want to know your opinions on the way universities and colleges operate, their funding, admissions policy and research resourcing. Do you think independence would be good or bad for post-school education in Scotland? Or does the status quo offer a weaker or stronger future for the tertiary education sector? If you would like to discuss these and other issues with an invited panel of guests, please fill in the application below. The special programme will be recorded on Monday, 28 October, at BBC Scotland's Glasgow headquarters. Participants will need to be available from 17:45 to 20:30. Guidelines require the BBC to reflect a broad range of views. To help us do this, we will ask all members of the audience whether they are associated with a political party, if they already have a view on the referendum and where in the British Isles they are from. Voters in Scotland will go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, next year when they will be asked the straight yes/no question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" </body>

      <body>The Daily Record has a picture of a shattered worker breaking down in tears after Ineos boss Calum MacLean wielded the axe on Grangemouth. A similar image is chosen by the Scottish Sun, which says workers at crisis-hit Grangemouth were left shellshocked. The Scotsman reports that the future of the refinery at Grangemouth and the thousands of workers it supports is hanging in the balance. According to the Herald, the union at the heart of the bitter dispute has capitulated in a last-ditch attempt to save 800 jobs at the troubled plant. Scottish and UK ministers have been left scrambling to find a buyer for the Grangemouth petrochemical complex, says the Courier, after owners Ineos announced the closure of the plant. The Press and Journal reports a court being told that former Rangers boss Craig Whyte found evidence suggesting one of his castle staff might poison him and harm his daughter. </body>

      <description>Germany summons the US ambassador in Berlin over claims that the US monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone.</description>

      <body>Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over claims that the US monitored German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone. Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle will meet US envoy John Emerson later in what is seen as an unusual step between close allies. Mrs Merkel has demanded a "complete explanation" of the claims, which are threatening to overshadow an EU summit. She discussed the issue with US President Barack Obama on Wednesday. President Obama told Mrs Merkel the US was not monitoring her calls and would not in future, the White House said. However, it left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. On Monday France summoned the US ambassador over reports in Le Monde newspaper that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had spied on millions of French phone calls. A day later, Le Monde reported that the NSA had spied on French diplomats in Washington and at the UN. French President Francois Hollande had already called for the issue to be put on the agenda of the summit, where EU leaders are due to discuss Europe's digital economy, economic recovery and immigration. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its NSA in Europe, says BBC Europe Editor Gavin Hewitt. The German government has not said how it received the tip about the alleged US spying. But news magazine Der Spiegel, which has published stories based on material from former CIA contractor Edward Snowden, said the information had come from its investigations. A Der Spiegel report in September that the US NSA had cracked the security codes the protect data on iPhones, Blackberries and Android devices led to demonstrations in Berlin. A number of US allies have expressed anger over the Snowden-based spying allegations. State-monitoring of phone calls has a particular resonance in Germany - Mrs Merkel herself grew up in East Germany, where phone-tapping was pervasive. Her spokesman said the German leader "views such practices... as completely unacceptable" and had demanded a "complete and comprehensive explanation". "Among close friends and partners, as the Federal Republic of Germany and the US have been for decades, there should be no such monitoring of the communications of a head of government," said Steffen Seibert in a statement. Veteran French European Commissioner Michel Barnier told the BBC "enough is enough" and that confidence in the US had been shaken. Mr Barnier, the commissioner for internal market and services, said Europe must not be naive but develop its own strategic digital tools, such as a "European data cloud" independent of American oversight. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says Germany's morning papers echo a sense of outrage. A front-page commentary in Thursday's Sueddeutscher Zeitung - one of the country's most respected papers - refers to the "biggest affront". It says an attack on Angela Merkel's mobile phone would be an attack on "her political heart". German Defence Minister Thomas de Maiziere said it would not be possible to go back to business as usual. This is more than a tiff which will blow over easily, our correspondent says. In July, German media carried comments by Mr Snowden suggesting the US National Security Agency worked closely with Germany and other Western states on a "no questions asked" basis, monitoring German internet traffic, emails and phone calls. "They [the NSA] are in bed with the Germans, just like with most other Western states," Mr Snowden was quoted as saying by Der Spiegel magazine - though Mrs Merkel denied any knowledge of the collaboration. In June, President Obama assured Chancellor Merkel that German citizens were not being routinely spied upon. At the time, she was criticised by her political opponents for not being more sceptical. </body>

      <title>'Little help' for Bangladesh victims</title>
      <description>Six months after a major clothing factory collapse in Bangladesh, 94% of the victims are still awaiting compensation, a charity says.</description>

      <body>Six months after a major clothing factory collapse in Bangladesh, 94% of the victims are still awaiting compensation, a charity says. The charity, Action Aid, says many survivors have serious injuries that have prevented them returning to work. More than 1,130 people died when the Rana Plaza building near Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, collapsed in April. Action Aid, questioned nearly two-thirds of survivors and victims' relatives for its survey. It found that 94% of those questioned said they had received no legal benefits from their employers, including sick pay or compensation. It also found that 92% of survivors had not gone back to work, with 63% of those reporting physical injuries including amputations, paralysis and severe pain. Of those surveyed, 92% said they were deeply traumatised. Until now, Primark is the only company that has provided financial support to victims - about Â£118 ($191) each to 3,300 people, according to Action Aid. The company has said it will continue to pay wages to those affected for three more months. The Action Aid survey found that survivors of the Rana Plaza disaster were facing severe financial difficulty. More than half said they had mounting debts, and more than 90% said they had no savings. Retailers in the EU and the US have pledged since April to improve working conditions in factories they use in Bangladesh, but negotiations between trade unions and retailers over long-term compensation have yet to produce a deal. On Tuesday, the Bangladeshi government and the International Labour Organization (ILO) launched a further initiative to improve the safety of buildings and prevent fires in the clothing industry. The $24m (Â£15m), three-and-a-half-year plan is to be funded by the British and Dutch governments. The ILO has been tasked with bringing together numerous measures aimed at improving working conditions, the BBC's Mahfuz Sadique reports from Dhaka. But he says that a fire at a textile plant earlier this month has highlighted once more the dangers still faced by workers. Bangladesh is reported to be the world's second largest exporter of ready-made clothes behind China. Latest government figures put the annual value of those exports at $21.5bn. The Rana Plaza collapse was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history. </body>

      <title>N Korea detainee reunion 'emotional'</title>
      <description>The mother of American Kenneth Bae, jailed by North Korea, says his health has improved but fears he will be returned to a labour camp.</description>

      <body>The mother of American Kenneth Bae, who is imprisoned in North Korea, told the BBC his health had improved following two months of medical treatment. But Myunghee Bae said her worst fear was that he would get sent back to a labour camp. The Korean-American was arrested last November and sentenced to 15 years' hard labour in May. Mr Bae, described as a tour operator and Christian missionary, was accused of plotting sedition. Mrs Bae was allowed to visit her son - who is reportedly suffering from a series of ailments including diabetes, an enlarged heart and back pain - on 11 October In an interview with the BBC, Ms Bae said she was not initially worried when she first heard the news that her son was arrested. "He always told me he was welcomed in North Korea. He brought tourism over there that helps the economy," she said, adding her son wanted to change the perception of North Korea to the outside world. Kenneth Bae was transferred from a labour camp to hospital earlier this year as his health deteriorated. Mrs Bae said she was trying to hold back tears when they met, and both of them were very emotional. "But my heart was aching when I saw him in a hospital garment, confined in a small space," she says. "How can I describe my heartache to leave him behind as a prisoner over there?" When asked if she had hope of seeing him released soon, she said: "That's really uncertain because as a family, we don't have any power to bring him home. We feel really helpless." But she said her family had faith and hope that the US government would bring him home. Known in North Korea as Pae Jun-ho, Mr Bae was arrested in November 2012 as he entered the north-eastern port city of Rason, a special economic zone near North Korea's border with China. His trial and conviction came at a time of high tension between the US and North Korea, in the wake of the communist state's third nuclear test on 13 February. Tensions have since eased somewhat. In August, North Korea issued and then revoked an invitation for US envoy Robert King to travel to Pyongyang to seek Mr Bae's release. North Korea has arrested several US citizens in recent years, including journalists and Christians accused of proselytising. They were released after visits to Pyongyang by high-profile officials, including former Presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter. The US accuses North Korea of using detained citizens as bargaining chips. Meanwhile, North Korea said on Thursday it would allow six detained South Koreans to return home on Friday. The group will cross over at the truce village of Panmunjom, North Korea's Red Cross said in a statement. The identities of the six are not clear, but it is possible four are are South Koreans that North Korea said it had detained for illegal entry in February 2010, officials said. </body>

      <title>Pakistan 'endorsed US drone strikes'</title>
      <description>Secret US documents show senior Pakistani government officials have known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes for years, a US paper reveals.</description>

      <body>Secret US documents reveal that senior Pakistani government officials have for years known of and endorsed CIA drone strikes, an American newspaper reports. The Washington Post obtained CIA documents and Pakistani diplomatic memos which indicate officials were routinely given classified briefings. Analysts have long suspected Pakistan gave tacit consent for such strikes despite publicly condemning them. Pakistan's PM Nawaz Sharif has urged US President Obama to halt such attacks. "I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes," Mr Sharif said after they met on Wednesday. The attacks by unmanned US aircraft have been a critical source of tension in the relationship between the countries and came up amid wide-ranging talks between the leaders in Washington. They are also deeply unpopular with the Pakistani public and Pakistan has consistently stated that they violate its sovereignty. The Pakistani government is yet to comment on the report. The documents obtained by the newspaper focus on at least 65 drone strikes in Pakistan over the last few years and were labelled as "talking points" for regular CIA briefings. Although they are marked "top secret", they are cleared for release to Pakistan, the paper reports. The Washington Post says the documents provide a detailed timeline of the CIA drone programme "tracing its evolution from a campaign aimed at a relatively short list of senior al-Qaeda operatives into a broader aerial assault against militant groups with no connection to the 11 September 2001 attacks". A spokesman for the Pakistani embassy in Washington did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper and the CIA also declined to comment. Correspondents say the files expose the explicit nature of the arrangement between the countries in the period when neither acknowledged that any drone programme even existed. In 2010 the controversial whistle-blowing site Wikileaks released numerous documents relating to Pakistan which showed the Pakistani military and other arms of the government had "quietly acquiesced" with drone strikes even though they publicly condemned them. In August 2008 then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani is reported to have said: "I don't care if they do it as long as they get the right people. We'll protest in the National Assembly and then ignore it." But this latest cache includes documents which appear to refer to a direct Pakistani role in the selection of targets, with the newspaper referring to one 2010 entry describing hitting a location "at the request of your government". There is also a reference to a "network of locations associated with a joint CIA-ISI targeting effort". The number of civilian casualties in these drone strikes has long been a source of dispute. Local claims of civilian deaths are almost impossible to prove. One reason is the restricted media access in the region. The other is the militants' tendency to cordon off the targeted sites and conduct quick burials. Earlier this week, Amnesty International released a report which said that CIA drone attacks in Pakistan are responsible for unlawful killings, some of which could amount to war crimes. The rights group named several victims who, it says, "posed no threat to life". Amnesty said it reviewed nine of 45 recent drone strikes in the volatile tribal region of North Waziristan where many strikes have hit, and found a number of victims had been unarmed. The US has defended its drone strikes in Pakistan and elsewhere. On Tuesday the White House said it takes "extraordinary care" to ensure they comply with international law and that they were a "course of action least likely to result in the loss of innocent life". A recent UN report also found that US drone strikes had killed at least 400 civilians in Pakistan, far more than the US has ever acknowledged. Estimates by other groups such as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism calculate that between 407 and 926 civilians were killed in Pakistan. The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad says that the general impression one gets from talking to elders and correspondents from the tribal area is that drone strikes are for the most part accurate, causing fewer civilian casualties than some reports suggest. Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago, when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-west Pakistan, without giving the Pakistani government advance warning. But in their meeting on Wednesday, Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan "have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security". </body>

      <body>A plane fighting bushfires in the Australian state of New South Wales has crashed, killing its pilot, as the military faced criticism for starting one of the major fires. The water-bombing plane crashed near Ulladulla, south of Sydney. Meanwhile the military said it was co-operating with a fire services probe that found an exercise using live ordnance started the State Mine fire. NSW has been battling bushfires for days, amid high temperatures. Officials have yet to release the identity of the pilot, who was the only person aboard the aircraft. His family has been informed of his death. "It's a tragedy for the fire-fighting community," said NSW Rural Fire Services Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. Thousands of firefighters have been mobilised to tackle the fires, and on Wednesday the state came through what officials had said would be a very dangerous day because of weather conditions. Thursday brought cooler weather but more than 60 fires are still burning. Worst-hit has been the Blue Mountains area, to the west of Sydney, where many homes have been destroyed and some residents evacuated. The State Mine blaze, near the Blue Mountains town of Lithgow, was seen as a serious cause for concern earlier in the week. Fire chief Shane Fitzsimmons said an investigation had found it was ignited by live ordnance. "It wasn't deliberate, it was a side-effect of a routine activity ... and clearly there was no intention to see fire start up and run as a result of that activity," he said. Acting Defence Minister George Brandis said the military "take this issue very seriously and continue to fully co-operate with the NSW authorities, including the NSW Police, who are investigating the fire". Acting Chief of Defence Air Marshall Mark Binskin subsequently offered an apology, saying: "What I do know to date is it was an explosives activity, it was a demolition activity in support of our people that train for operations around the world". Blue Mountains Mayor Mark Greenhill said the military should have known better. "I would have hoped on a day like that which was a dry day, a hot day, with the winds, the Australian military would have known it wasn't a good time to be igniting. So far the NSW fires have destroyed more than 200 homes and left one man dead. Meanwhile, former US Vice-President Al Gore has entered the debate over climate change, calling on Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott not to repeal the carbon tax. On Wednesday, Mr Abbott accused the UN climate chief, Christiana Figueres, of "talking through her hat" when she described bushfires as "absolutely" linked to climate change. Mr Gore told ABC News: "Bushfires can occur naturally, and do, but the science shows clearly that when the temperature goes up, and when the vegetation and soils dry out, then wildfires become more pervasive and more dangerous. "The meaningful way to solve this crisis is to put a price on carbon, and in Australia's case to keep a price on carbon," he said. Mr Abbott is working to repeal a tax on carbon introduced by the Labor government that charges Australia's top 300 polluters for their emissions. He says the tax cost jobs and drove energy prices up, and intends to replace it with a subsidies scheme.

Asked about the fate of 140,000 Muslims who have been forced to leave their homes, she said that many Buddhists had also fled Burma, also known as Myanmar. Ms Suu Kyi denied that Muslims had been subjected to ethnic cleansing. She has been criticised for not defending Muslims since she emerged from house arrest two years ago. Over the past two years, violence between Buddhists and Rohingya Muslims has broken out in the state of Rakhine. There have also been clashes between Buddhists and Muslims in central Burma. Muslims have borne the worst of the violence, with hundreds killed, often by mobs armed with knives and sticks. "I think the problem is due to the fear felt by both sides," she told the BBC's Mishal Husain. "Muslims have been targeted but Buddhists have also been subjected to violence. "This fear is what is leading to all this trouble." She said tensions had also been inflamed by a worldwide perception - also felt in Burma - that global Muslim power was "very great". She said that it was down to the government to bring an end to the violence and the return of Buddhist refugees who had been forced to leave the country in recent years to escape political persecution. "This is the result of our sufferings under a dictatorial regime. I think that if you live under a dictatorship for many years people do not like to trust one another - a dictatorship generates a climate of mistrust," she said. Ms Suu Kyi said that the effective implementation of the rule of law was essential. "Before people can sit down and sort out their differences they have to feel safe. If they feel that they are going to be killed in their beds they are not going to talk about harmony or learn to understand one another." She said that Burma still had a long way to go before becoming fully democratic. "People assume too readily that on a path to democracy - that we are democratising at a fast rate - but it is not happening like that at all." </body>

      <body>The female head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) has been named the most powerful figure in the art world. Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani came top of ArtReview magazine's annual Power 100 due to "her organisation's vast purchasing power". Sheikha Al-Mayassa first appeared on the Power 100 in 2011 at number 90, rising to number 11 in 2012. China's Ai Weiwei, who topped the countdown in 2011, is the highest-placed artist at number nine. Other familiar names in the top 10 include art dealer Larry Gagosian, ranked at four, and Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota, placed at six. The latter was made a Companion of Honour by Prince Charles on Wednesday at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his services to art. Sheikha Al-Mayassa is the sister of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who assumed the role of Qatar's emir when his father abdicated in June. According to ArtReview, the QMA spends around $1bn a year (Â£618m) developing galleries, sponsoring film festivals and supporting public art. It also sponsored Tate Modern's Damien Hirst exhibition, which attracted more than 463,000 visitors during its run last year. Last year's Power 100 was also topped by a woman - Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, the curator of the influential Documenta 13 exhibition in Kassel, Germany. David Zwirner, who owns galleries in London and New York, is in second place in this year's rundown, while his former business partner Iwan Wirth is ranked at three. Sir Nicholas comes just behind Hans Ulrich Obrist and Julia Peyton-Jones, the co-creators of the Serpentine galleries in London. Compiled by a 13-member international jury, the Power 100 is described as "a unique snapshot of the contemporary art scene". According to the contemporary art magazine, those included are "judged on their international influence over the production of art and contribution to the art world during the past 12 months". </body>

      <body>Russia's chief sanitary inspector, Gennady Onishchenko has been dismissed from his post and given a new job. A spokeswoman for the Russian Prime Minister, Dmitry Medvedev, denied that Mr Onishchenko had been dismissed. She said his contract had ended and he had now been appointed as an adviser to the prime minister. During his tenure, Mr Onishchenko was widely known for making a number of controversial decisions regarding food products from neighbouring countries. Correspondents say he used his position at the Rospotrebnadzor agency to punish countries which disagreed with Russia. But Mr Onishchenko has always denied that political motives influenced the measures taken by the agency. In March 2006 Russia banned the imports of wine and mineral water from Georgia, citing contamination of some shipments and warning of risks to health. The move came at a time of deteriorating relations between the two countries as Georgia took a more pro-Western stance and stated it wanted to join the Western military alliance, Nato. A similar stance was taken against Belarussia in 2009 as the country moved closer towards the European Union. The Russian food agency reacted by banning the export of vegetables on health grounds. In August this year, Mr Onishchenko banned chocolate imports from Ukraine's largest confectioner, saying its products fell below safety standards. Correspondents say the decision coincided with the uneasy relationship over energy supplies, and may also have been in retaliation for Kiev's import duties on Russian cars and attempts to set up a customs union. This month Lithuania - as it prepares to host an EU summit aimed at forging closer ties with neighbouring countries - was told its dairy products would be banned because they did no longer met the necessary quality standards. He also recommended avoiding sushi because of a risk of tapeworms and he proposed killing crows, which he described as feathered wolves, for allegedly spreading bird flu. </body>

      <body>A 13-year-old boy carrying a replica assault rifle has been shot dead by police in the US state of California. Officers in the city of Santa Rosa say they opened fire after the boy refused orders to drop the rifle, which they believed to be real. The shooting on Tuesday is now being investigated. It comes a day after a 12-year-old boy in Nevada shot dead a maths teacher at his school and wounded two fellow pupils before taking his own life. In the latest incident, two sheriff's deputies saw the teenager "with what appeared to be some type of rifle", a news release from the Sonoma County Sheriff's office said. The deputies called for backup and repeatedly ordered the boy to drop the gun before firing several rounds from their handguns, police said. The boy, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was later identified by his family as Andy Lopez. "He was holding the weapon in his left hand. He began to turn toward his right in the direction of the deputy, and in so doing he moved the gun toward the deputy, and the deputy's mindset was that he was fearful he would be shot," Lt Paul Henry of Santa Rosa police said. But the boy's father, Rodrigo Lopez said the shooting made no sense. "My son lost his life. He's not alive any more just because of the mistake of somebody." The replica gun had belonged to a friend, he said. The sheriff's office said a plastic handgun had also been found in the boy's waistband. Witness Brian Zastrow told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat he heard seven shots. "First, I heard a single siren and within seconds I heard seven shots go off, sounded like a nail gun," he said. One man who saw the events unfold said the shooting was over in an instant. "He pulled over to the kid walking and he just opened the door and shot him, three shots," Ismael Mondragon told KGO-TV. Police Lt Dennis O'Leary said the deputies had been placed on administrative leave pending the inquiry. Sheriff Steve Freitas described the shooting as a "tragedy" and promised the investigation would be thorough and transparent. "As a father of two boys about this age, I can't begin to imagine the grief this family is going through," he said. A spokeswoman for the boy's school described him as "a very loved student, a very popular, very handsome young man, very smart and capable". Linsey Gannon, assistant principal at Lawrence Cook Middle School, said he played trumpet in the school band. "Our community has been rocked by his loss," she said. Candles, teddy bears and flowers have since been left at the scene of the shooting. "He was a good kid, he was 13 years old. He didn't look like a man, Andy, he was a boy," one friend told local media. On Monday, a 12-year-old boy who has not been named opened fire at a school in Sparks, Nevada, killing maths teacher and Afghanistan veteran Michael Landsberry. Police said Mr Landsberry had tried to coax the boy to drop the gun, enabling children in the playground to flee. The boy then shot and injured two fellow pupils, before taking his own life on the outdoor basketball court. President Barack Obama has recently renewed calls for changes to US gun laws following a series of deadly shootings. However, the BBC's Alastair Leithead in Los Angeles says the proposals face fierce resistance. </body>

      <body>Indian singer Manna Dey has died in a Bangalore hospital at the age of 94. He had been ill for the past few months and was in hospital for a respiratory infection. His funeral is due to take place later on Thursday. Born Prabodh Chandra Dey in 1919, Dey was popularly known as Manna, and chalked up a number of hit Bollywood songs in a career spanning six decades. He sang in several languages including Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Bhojpuri. His long career saw him win several awards for his contribution to music, including state honours like the Padma Shri in 1971 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2005. He was also given the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007. Dey sang more than 3,500 songs, including romantic ballads, intricate raga-based songs, Qawwalis and fast-paced modern numbers in his career. Along with Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh, and Kishore Kumar, he made up what was known as the "famous quartet of singers" who dominated the Hindi film music industry from 1950s to 1970s. Many of Dey's tracks for Bollywood films became huge hits and he sang for some of the biggest Bollywood names like Raj Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra. His most popular numbers included Zindagi kaisi hai paheli (Life, what a riddle it is) from the film Anand; Poocho na kaise maine raen bitayee (Don't ask how I spent my night) from Meri Surat Teri Aankhen, Ek chatur naar (A clever woman) from Padosan and and Eey bhai zara dekh ke chalo (Oh brother, look where you're going) from Meraa Naam Joker. He also sang for Bollywood super-hits Sholay and Amar Akbar Anthony. In the last few years, he had largely withdrawn from public life. Tributes have been pouring in for the singer from the film industry and his fans on social media sites. Information and Broadcasting Minister Manish Tewari led the nation in paying tributes to "a legend who enthralled a whole generation". "Deepest condolences on the sad demise of Manna Dey. His voice and unique style enthralled a whole generation. Another legend has left us," the minister wrote on Twitter. "Manna Dey, stalwart of the music world, passes away. Flooded with memories and his songs," tweeted Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. In another tweet, Bachchan said: "Strange how we connect events of our life with his songs." "Manna Dey passes away. His voice shall linger forever. R.I.P." tweeted film-maker Mahesh Bhat. Actor Manoj Bajpai tweeted: "Manna Dey is no more! A great singer! Let's pray for him! My condolences to his family! His music will live for 1000 yrs. RIP" Actress Shabana Azmi wrote: "Manna Dey had a unique voice. He will live on through his songs Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen/ dil ka haal suney dilwala/ poocho na kaise maine. RIP." Popular cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted. "Oh no. Such terrible news to get up to. Manna Dey no more? Less melody in the world." </body>

      <body>Kenya's police chief has warned journalists over their coverage of last month's attack on the Westgate shopping centre, following reports of looting by soldiers. David Kimaiyo said reporters should not "provoke propaganda" or "incite Kenyans" in their coverage. CCTV footage has been leaked on local media which appears to show soldiers taking items from a supermarket. The army has said the soldiers were only taking water during the siege. At least 67 people, including six members of the security forces, were killed after Islamist militants stormed one of Nairobi's biggest shopping centres, staying there for four days. Somalia's al-Shabab group has said it was behind the attack. As well as the looting, local media have also reported that some members of the security forces were killed by friendly fire during the siege, raising concerns about the command structure. Mr Kimaiyo said two investigative journalists from KTN, a private Kenyan television station operated by the Standard Group, were among those threatened with arrest. "We are looking within the law very closely for those individuals who in one way or another might have committed crimes," the police chief told journalists in the capital, Nairobi, on Wednesday. They would soon "be apprehended and appear before the court, and face the consequences of this", he said. Mr Kimaiyo said that journalists should not "issue statements that can amount to hate speech" or statements that "could affect the life of another person". Atul Shah, the head of Nakumatt, the supermarket which was allegedly looted, was summoned by police investigating how the CCTV footage had appeared in local media, Kenya's Standard newspaper reports. Regarding concerns over which security agency was in command of the rescue operation at Westgate, Mr Kimaiyo said that as head of the police, he had been consulted. "It was a joint effort, and we clearly agreed on how to conduct it," Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper quotes him as saying. During the press conference he also said that police were now holding eight suspects who would soon be charged in court. He did not give their names or explain their alleged role in the attack. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants, who are all believed to have died by the end of the siege. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the four attackers is suspected of being a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. </body>

      <body>Social networking site Pinterest has seen its value jump by more than 50% to $3.8bn (Â£2.3bn) following its latest round of fundraising. The three-year old company, which has yet to generate revenue, said it had raised $225m from a group of investors led by Fidelity Investments. Earlier this year it had raised $200m, valuing the firm at $2.5bn. Pinterest said it plans to use the new funds to further expand internationally and develop its mobile services. "We hope to be a service that everyone uses to inspire their future, whether that's dinner tomorrow night, a vacation next summer, or a dream house someday," Pinterest co-founder and chief executive Ben Silbermann said in a statement. "This new investment enables us to pursue that goal even more aggressively." The San Francisco-based company is also looking at ways of monetising its service. Earlier this month the firm started testing the use of 'promoted pins' as a possible form of advertising. Pinterest has secured its latest round of financing amid renewed demand for fast-growing interest companies. Micro-blogging site Twitter, for example, is looking to raise about $1bn through a share offering later this year. There is strong interest in Twitter, which has seen its value skyrocket in recent years. In the prospectus for its initial public offering, Twitter valued itself at nearly $13bn as of August. In July 2007, the firm was worth about $200,000. Social networking giant Facebook listed in New York last year after raising a record $16bn. The new valuation for Pinterest, which has 46m users, now makes it worth more than some publicly traded tech companies, such as mobile game developer Zynga. But for many analysts, the big question is how the free service can make money based on a business that lets people share images of objects or projects by "pinning" pictures online. </body>

      <body>A former US campus policeman who pepper-sprayed peaceful protesters has been awarded $38,000 (Â£23,400) in compensation for psychiatric damage. Lieutenant John Pike received threats after footage of the incident went viral on the internet in 2011. It showed him casually spraying protesters from the Occupy Wall Street movement as they sat on the ground at the University of California. His award is not much less than that received by the protesters he harmed. Mr Pike was suspended from his job at University of California Davis after the incident and left the force in July 2012. An official investigation found that university officials and UC Davis police used poor judgment and excessive force in the confrontation. In June, Mr Pike filed a worker's compensation claim with UC Davis over the incident, claiming he suffered psychiatric and nervous system damage. Local reports said Mr Pike had received more than 17,000 angry or threatening emails, 10,000 text messages and hundreds of letters after the video of the pepper-spraying was published. UC Davis spokesman Andy Fell said on Wednesday that the Division of Workers Compensation Appeals Board agreed on 16 October to resolve his claim by paying him a settlement totalling $38,055, Reuters news agency reported. The amount of compensation "in line with permanent impairment as calculated by the state's disability evaluation unit," Mr Fell said. Last year, the university agreed to pay $1 million to settle a lawsuit brought on behalf of the 21 students who got sprayed and later reported suffering panic attacks, trauma and academic problems as a result. </body>

      <body>French police say they have broken up a scam in which fake bottles of a top French wine were sold. They say the fraudsters netted up to 2m euros ($2.75m; Â£1.7m) from the scheme. Bottles of poor-quality wine were allegedly relabelled as Romanee-Conti, a Burgundy that is one of the world's finest and most expensive wines. Two Italian wine merchants have been arrested. They are suspected of selling 400 fake bottles - though it is feared many more may be on the market. French prosecutors say counterfeit labels were treated with wax to make them look older, and the result was so good that the bottles were near-perfect copies of the real thing. French police started an investigation after the vineyard said it had become aware of inferior copies being sold. Their investigation reached six European countries, including Britain and Italy. France has requested the extradition of the two Italians - a father and son - arrested in their home country. Several others have been arrested or questioned. Dijon prosecutor Marie-Christine Tarrare said: "Other suspects are being sought so that we can present this entire counterfeiting network in evidence." Romanee-Conti, like other Burgundy reds made from the pinot noir grape, is produced on a small estate of just 1.8 ha (four acres), making it highly exclusive. In 2011 a 12-bottle case of the 1990 vintage went for $297,000 (Â£183,000) at auction. </body>

      <body>Two officials in China have been sacked after unauthorised "restoration" work left centuries-old Buddhist frescos ruined, state media report. The paintings were inside a 270-year-old temple in the north-eastern province of Liaoning, and dated back to the early period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). They have been completely painted over with cartoon-like Taoist figures. The case, exposed by a blogger, has drawn widespread condemnation in China. An official in charge of temple affairs and the head of the cultural heritage monitoring team in the city of Chaoyang, where the temple is located, have been sacked over the affair, the Global Times reported. The Communist Party chief of the office responsible for the scenic area surrounding the temple has also been given a warning, the paper quoted city official Li Haifeng as saying. The scandal was exposed by a blogger nicknamed Wujiaofeng, who posted photos of the "restored" frescos online and compared them with pictures of the originals. The local government in Chaoyang immediately launched an investigation after photos of the new paintings appeared online, the Global Times reported. Permission for the work to go ahead was given by city-level cultural heritage officials after a request by the temple abbot. But it should have been sought from the cultural heritage office at provincial level to ensure national standards were followed. This had not happened, Mr Li said. The project was given to a local firm which was not qualified for carrying out repair works on cultural relics, the official said. With investigations still going on, more officials will be punished, the paper added. Experts who work for the provincial cultural heritage office in Liaoning have suggested the frescos could be restored to how they used to look, but they will never be as good as the originals. The "restoration" work has drawn condemnation from users of Weibo, China's version of Twitter. One user said "I feel some people's brains were kicked by a donkey." Another said: "Ignorance is horrible!" </body>

      <title>Sharif urges Obama to end drone hits</title>
      <description>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif tells President Obama drone strikes there must cease, while the leaders pledge to strengthen the nations' strained ties.</description>

      <body>Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif has told President Obama the US should halt drone strikes in Pakistan, a critical source of tension in the relationship. The two leaders held wide-ranging talks at the White House on Wednesday, pledging to strengthen the often-strained ties between the nations. The leaders also discussed tension between Pakistan and India over the disputed Kashmir region. Mr Obama said the US and Pakistan remained important strategic partners. The talks in the Oval Office came just hours after India accused Pakistani troops of firing guns and mortars at several dozen Indian border posts in Kashmir. One Indian guard was killed and six others injured, according to media reports. Mr Obama did not address the incident in remarks after their meeting, but praised Mr Sharif for "taking a very wise path in exploring how decades of tension between India and Pakistan can be reduced". "Billions of dollars have been spent on an arms race in response to these tensions, and those resources could be much more profitably invested in education, social welfare programmes on both sides of the border," he said. "[That] would be good for the entire subcontinent - and good for the world." Mr Sharif spoke of his commitment to building a "co-operative relationship with India, and our efforts to peacefully resolve all our outstanding issues, including Kashmir". Relations between Islamabad and Washington nosedived more than two years ago, when US special forces killed al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden in a raid on his hideout in Abbottabad in north-eastern Pakistan without giving the Pakistani government advance warning. Their ties were further tested by the killing of 24 Pakistani troops in a US air strike along the Afghan border later in 2011. Following the meeting, Mr Obama acknowledged that tensions and misunderstandings would persist between the two nations. "It's a challenge. It's not easy," he said. "We are committed to working together and making sure that rather than this being a source of tension between our two countries, it can be a source of strength." And he pledged co-operation in "ways that respect Pakistan's sovereignty, that respect the concerns of both countries". Mr Sharif said the US and Pakistan "have travelled together as friends and allies in defence of freedom and the pursuit of international peace and security". "Our two countries are bound by a common commitment to the cherished values of democracy," he said. Mr Sharif said the two had agreed to strengthen co-operation on counterterrorism. "I also brought up the issue of drones in our meeting, emphasising the need for an end to such strikes," he said. He stated his top domestic priorities were the economy, energy, education and combating extremist activity. "We both agreed that progress in these core areas is indispensable for creating new opportunities and building a hopeful future for our next generation," Mr Sharif said. Mr Obama said both leaders had agreed on the importance of leaving Pakistan's neighbour Afghanistan "stable and secure" as US and coalition forces prepare to withdraw next year. The White House said a peaceful Pakistan-Afghanistan border was critical to a successful counterterrorism and counterinsurgency effort. Both leaders "expressed satisfaction with the positive momentum achieved in defence relations", the White House later said in a statement. They also pledged to abide by the commitments of the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul, Korea, emphasising that nuclear terrorism was "one of the most challenging threats to international security," the White House said. </body>

      <body>President Barack Obama's Democratic allies have begun voicing frustration with widespread problems with aspects of his signature healthcare law. House Democrats have complained that technical issues with the insurance enrolment websites had overshadowed the law's current and future benefits. Some demanded Mr Obama find and sack those responsible for the glitches. Mr Obama has said technical problems with the site are "unacceptable" and pledges they will soon be fixed. He assured Americans on Monday that technical experts from both inside and outside the government were working around the clock to fix the website and its underpinnings. The health law, known formally as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and informally as Obamacare, was passed in 2010 and is Mr Obama's foremost domestic policy initiative. Among its central provisions are an expansion of the Medicaid public health programme for poor people, a requirement that Americans who do not have insurance from their employers or the government buy it on their own - with subsidies to aid the purchase, and a rule allowing children to remain on their parents' insurance until age 26. Mr Obama and the law's supporters say it will eventually reshape America's costly and inefficient healthcare system and provide insurance to most of the estimated 46 million Americans who lack it. At issue currently are websites run by the federal government and some states that serve as online marketplaces where individuals can compare private insurance plans, learn about available public subsidies, and sign up for a plan. The sites, known as exchanges, opened on 1 October. The White House aims to enrol as many as seven million people through the exchanges by the 31 March end of the enrolment period. The central site run by the federal government, healthcare.gov, has been plagued with problems, notably extremely long wait times. Websites run by individual states have not performed as poorly. The Republicans, who have opposed the law from the beginning and have sought to undermine it at every turn, are now calling for the rollout to be delayed and for deadlines for enrolment to be pushed back. The Republicans have also loudly demanded an investigation into the exchanges' shortcomings. "It is our job to hold them accountable, and when it comes to Obamacare clearly there is a lot to hold accountable," House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner said on Wednesday. In light of the technical difficulties, some Democrats have also said Mr Obama should consider extending the enrolment period beyond 31 March. But House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi advised against that. "I think we should try to fix what we have, move forward with the deadline we have," she said. "What we want to do is fix it and go forward with it, not make policies that are predicated on its not working." Complaints from Mr Obama's fellow Democrats are a relatively new part of the debate. Democratic members of the House of Representatives left a briefing provided by the administration on Wednesday saying they had resolved not to let the problems with one part of the rollout overwhelm the law's benefits. "The president needs to man up, find out who was responsible, and fire them," Minnesota Congressman Richard Nolan said. "You don't get many second chances to get a good first impression." The White House has sought to reassure political allies and Americans at large that the government is working to resolve the issues. The Obama administration has launched what senior officials called a "tech surge", with senior economic aide Jeffrey Zients tasked with analysing and repairing the problems. On Wednesday, executives from top health insurance companies agreed to form technical teams to help the Obama administration fix the website and the systems underlying it. "We are collaborating closely with the insurers to address problems we have witnessed," the White House said in a statement, after executives from 14 insurance companies met Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other senior administration officials. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>
      <description>Cuba is to scrap its divisive two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report.</description>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <body>Clowns gathered at a convention in Mexico City have denied any of their colleagues were behind the killing of a former drug cartel leader last Friday. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. Gunmen dressed as clowns opened fire on the former leading member of the once-powerful and violent Tijuana cartel, authorities say. Around 500 clowns at the convention held a "laugh-a-ton" rally for peace. A clown leader said if a real member of the profession had been involved in the shooting, they would have been easily identifiable by their costumes, masks and painting. "The people who do that, they're not clowns. I can swear on my mother's grave it wasn't a clown," Tomas Morales, whose stage name is Clown Llantom, told Associated Press news agency. They say clowns are frequently victims of robberies and their costumes and masks are then used to commit other crimes. The attack against Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

      <body>Two UN peacekeepers from Chad have been killed and six others wounded - some "severely" - in a suicide attack in northern Mali, the UN has said. Civilians also died when a bomber drove an explosives-laden vehicle to the checkpoint in Tessalit before blowing himself up, the statement said. One child was killed and another injured, Reuters quoted Mali government officials as saying. The UN has nearly 6,000 troops in Mali to tackle militant Islamists. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the attack "will not affect the determination of the United Nations to support the restoration of security, stability and lasting peace in Mali". The UN Security Council condemned the attack "in the strongest terms". It expressed condolences to the families of the peacekeepers killed, as well as to the governments of Mali and Chad. The Security Council said those responsible would be held accountable and it called Mali "to swiftly investigate... and bring the perpetrators to justice". Mali's defence ministry said four bombers took part in the raid and all died, Reuters reported. The UN's special representative to Mali, Bert Koenders, earlier this month called for more troops to be deployed following an upsurge in bombings and rocket attacks. French troops captured northern Mali's key cities and towns from the militants after launching an operation to oust them in January. It handed security responsibility to the UN force in July. The force, known as Minusma, has less than half of its mandated strength of more than 12,000 military personnel. </body>

      <title>Toure wants action on racist chants</title>
      <description>Yaya Toure calls on Uefa to act on racist chanting after claiming he was targeted during Manchester City's 2-1 win at CSKA Moscow.</description>

      <body>Manchester City midfielder Yaya Toure is "furious" and wants Uefa to act on racist chanting after claiming he was targeted by home fans during his side's 2-1 victory at CSKA Moscow. The Ivory Coast international said he told referee Ovidiu Hategan about the chants as City came from behind to win the Champions League Group D tie. City, for whom Sergio Aguero scored twice, will make a complaint to Uefa. Toure said: "I'm not just disappointed, I'm furious." The 30-year-old captained City in the absence of injured defender Vincent Kompany. He added: "I'm very, very disappointed about what those fans have done. I think Uefa has to take action because players with the same colour of skin will always be in the same position. "For me, as captain, I was wearing an armband which said 'no to racism' and I was totally disappointed. "I told the referee. It was unbelievable and very sad." Asked what action he would like the European governing body to take, Toure said: "Maybe they could ban the stadium, I don't know, for a couple of years or a couple of months. "We have to be as strong as possible otherwise they will continue like that. Too much is too much. We have to stop it now." In May, Uefa announced that for racist incidents involving spectators, a partial stadium closure for the first offence and a full stadium closure for a second, coupled with a fine of 50,000 euros (Â£42,800), would be applied. Toure added: "It's not only in Eastern Europe and I have some friends who have had problems, too. "It's stupid. It just happens in football. As an African player, it is always sad when you hear something like that." City boss Manuel Pellegrini also called for action and said: "I think it's a pity that anyone would do such stupid things. I hope that they have heard the right measures to stop all those things, so it's a pity for Yaya, it's a pity for the city." Kompany did not play because of a thigh injury, but in a tweetÂ  after the game wrote: "Racist chants again in Moscow today. We've all said enough. Uefa, the Russian government and CSKA, all eyes are on you now. #StopRacism." Fifa vice-president Jim Boyce said he was "absolutely appalled". "I have always been very outspoken about any form of racism in sport," he told Radio 5 live. "Fifa and Uefa are absolutely united in making sure these events will become a thing of the past. I have always said fining clubs is not a solution to this problem because they can't stop some of these idiots. "The new rules say sanctions will be imposed. "It's got to be eradicated and the only way to do that is to take serious action against the people who do it. "Don't allow them to watch football matches and then perhaps they'll stop when they realise they won't get into a ground." With Russia staging the 2018 World Cup, Boyce added that the authorities needed to tackle racism in the country as a matter of urgency. "The Russian federation has got to assure - along with the Russian government - that these incidents are put to bed because it's happening too often," he said. Piara Powar, who heads the organisation Football Against Racism in Europe, said: "It's taken a long time but we are seeing some movement on the sanctions side. "In terms of education, I don't know how long it's going to take, to educate fans like we've seen at CSKA. We need governments to intervene." Speaking to 5 live he added: "The key thing here is Yaya Toure did what he should do: approach the referee and tell him about it. "That means that technically the Uefa process is triggered. The referee will have to mention it to the Uefa delegate at the match, he will put it in his report and Uefa will then have to charge CSKA." </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; Â£210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <body>Two Chinese children were killed and four others injured when a wall at their school collapsed on top of them. Officials in Zhenxiong county, Yunnan province, said sacks of coal had been stacked against one side of the brick wall, pushing it over. Local government official Song Yufeng said the children were all around the age of 12. Correspondents say the safety of school buildings in China has been called into question in the past. Shoddy construction was blamed for the collapse of many schools during a major earthquake in 2008 that killed thousands. In the latest incident, the four injured children were in a stable condition at a hospital in Linkou, a report on the website yunnan.cn said. The two victims, a boy and a girl, died on the way to hospital, the report said. </body>

      <title>EU to hold summit amid US spying row</title>
      <description>EU leaders are due to hold a summit in Brussels with fresh allegations of US spying threatening to overshadow talks.</description>

      <body>An EU summit is due to begin in Brussels with fresh allegations of US spying threatening to overshadow talks on the economy and migration. Leaders want to try to consolidate Europe's fragile economic recovery, and speed implementation of a single market in digital services. British PM David Cameron will also call on the EU to cut red tape on business. But new allegations of US eavesdropping on Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel may also be discussed. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin to explain, after claims arose in the German media that her mobile phone calls had been bugged. France's President Francois Hollande is pressing for the issue to be put on the summit agenda, following reports that millions of French calls have been monitored. The veteran French EU Commissioner Michel Barnier told the BBC that "enough is enough", and confidence in the US had been shaken. Mr Barnier, the commissioner for internal market and services, said Europe must not be naive but develop its own strategic digital tools, such as a "European data cloud" independent of American oversight. The digital economy is on the official summit agenda for Thursday evening. One of the key initiatives of the European Commission is its Digital Agenda for Europe, which it says "aims to reboot Europe's economy and help Europe's citizens and businesses to get the most out of digital technologies". Council officials say investment in the digital economy is vital to boost growth, which is creeping back to the European economy. They want to address market fragmentation and a perceived shortage in IT skills. They may also discuss telecoms reform, data protection and a cap on credit card payments. With markets becalmed, Spain coming out of recession and Ireland soon to exit its bailout programme, there are signs of progress for Europe's leaders to celebrate, says the BBC's Gavin Hewitt in Brussels. But they recognise that the recovery is fragile and solid growth is needed. Mr Cameron is likely to use the economic discussion to raise what Britain sees as a proliferation of red tape. He said last week: "All too often EU rules are a handicap for firms," and that small business owners "are forced to spend too much time complying with pointless, burdensome and costly regulations". The European Commission - which makes the rules - has recognised that it may have gone too far in some places. President Jose Manuel Barroso says he wants the EU to be "big on big things and smaller on smaller things". He says the Commission has cut more than 5,000 legal acts in the past five years and wants to do more. On Friday the leaders will discuss relations with central European countries, ahead of a November summit in Lithuania, where new agreements will be signed. Migration will also be discussed, following the loss of hundreds of lives among migrants trying to reach Europe from Africa and the Middle East. The Commission has called on EU countries to offer "additional and urgent contributions" to prevent further tragedies at sea. It wants greater resources to survey and patrol sea routes, but also a more co-ordinated approach to dealing with migrants. Countries in the Mediterranean deal with sudden and unmanageable mass arrivals, but the countries which approve most asylum requests are Germany, France and Sweden. The Commission wants a more even resettlement of refugees. EU sources say the leaders are likely to promise improved co-operation, but not more money or resources. They say they first want a new surveillance system, Eurosur, to come into force, to see what effect it has. </body>

      <body>Tens of thousands of people have taken part in rival rallies in the Hungarian capital, Budapest, to mark the anniversary of the 1956 uprising against the Soviet Union. Although many took to the streets to remember the victims, events were dominated by party politics. Conservative PM Viktor Orban likened his opponents to those who betrayed the uprising, while an opposition rally called for Mr Orban to be removed. Hungary is to hold elections next year. The BBC's Nick Thorpe in Hungary said the largest crowd gathered at Heroes Square to listened to Mr Orban rail against "domestic traitors" and "foreign speculators". Mr Orban compared opposition parties with those who betrayed the revolution 57 years ago, and likened Soviet troops to foreign banks and speculators today. At another demonstration on the banks of the Danube, about 20,000 people heard an array of leftist and liberal party leaders call for the ousting of Mr Orban's government. Meanwhile, in the city centre the far-right Jobbik party lambasted both the government and other opposition parties. Our correspondent says many people tried to ignore the party-political events and remember the victims of the uprising - those who fell on the barricades or were executed or imprisoned after it was crushed. The events of 1956 became a lasting symbol of the Cold War. Hungary declared 23 October a national holiday after democracy was restored in Hungary in 1990. Mr Orban has been able to push through changes to Hungary's constitution because of the two-thirds majority his Fidesz party and its allies enjoy in parliament following the 2010 election. However, critics have accused him of eroding democratic rights. </body>

      <description>An explosion near the airport in Syria's capital, Damascus, is followed by blackouts in the city and across the country.</description>

      <body>Large parts of Syria have been hit by a power cut following an explosion near the airport in the capital, Damascus. The lights went out after rebel artillery reportedly hit a gas pipeline that supplies a power station. Residents say the entire capital has been plunged into darkness and officials said the power cuts had been nationwide. Many parts of Syria have suffered sporadic power cuts since the start of the country's civil war. "A terrorist attack on a gas pipeline that feeds a power station in the south has led to a power outage in the provinces, and work to repair it is in progress," Syria's state news agency Sana quoted Electricity Minister Imad Khamis as saying. He said it could take up to 48 hours to restore supplies. President Bashar al-Assad has frequently referred to his opponents as foreign-backed "terrorists". UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said rebel shelling had been aimed at the town of Ghasula, around 2km (1.2 miles) from the airport. "It is likely this was a large-scale operation planned well in advance," Observatory director Rami Abdel Rahman told AFP. Activists say a huge fire was seen blazing near the airport. It is unclear whether anyone was hurt. Meanwhile the SOHR says a car bomb has hit a military checkpoint in a western suburb of Damascus, causing multiple casualties among security forces. In another development, the body tasked with destroying Syria's chemical arsenal has said that Damascus is due to hand over its disarmament plan on Thursday. In a press conference on Wednesday, the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said it expected Syria's initial declaration within the next 24 hours. The OPCW and the UN have had a team of 60 experts and support staff in Syria since 1 October. They have said that the Syrian government has been co-operating with the watchdog's work. The OPCW's mission to rid Syria of chemical weapons was set up by a UN resolution. It followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August. </body>

      <body>At least 19 police officers and three civilians have been killed in a series of attacks overnight in the western Iraqi province of Anbar, officials say. The first saw a suicide bomber ram an explosives-filled car into a checkpoint in Rutba, 110km (70 miles) from the Syrian border, killing five policemen. Another bomber blew up his vehicle near police deployed at a bypass, killing four officers and three lorry drivers. Attacks by gunmen elsewhere in Anbar left seven other officers dead. They opened fire on several checkpoints west of Ramadi, along the main road that links the capital Baghdad to Jordan and Syria. Further attacks on Wednesday in and around Baghdad killed at least seven people and wounded about 20 others. Officials said two of those killed were policeman who were shot while going to work. They said one bomb exploded during the morning rush hour in a commercial street in the city's Amariya district. Another bomb went off at an outdoor market in the Abu Ghraib area, to the west. In the market town of Madain, south of Baghdad, a bomb killed at least four people and wounded at least nine others. Elsewhere, a gunman shot dead six people people in the northern city of Mosul, according to the AFP news agency. There has been a surge in sectarian violence across Iraq this year not seen since 2008. According to the monitoring group, Iraq Body Count, more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in the country this year. Almost 1,000 people were killed and more than 2,000 wounded in September alone, the UN says, making it one of the highest monthly death tolls for years. The UN says 979 people - including 127 police and 92 military personnel - were killed in violent attacks in September, bringing the number killed this year to 5,740. The unrest was sparked by an army raid on a Sunni Arab anti-government protest camp in April. The protesters were calling for the resignation of Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki and denouncing the authorities for allegedly targeting the minority Sunni community. Iraq has also seen a spill-over of violence from the conflict in Syria, where jihadist rebels linked to the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group that includes al-Qaeda, have risen to prominence. In the past two months, Iraqi security forces have reportedly arrested hundreds of alleged al-Qaeda members in and around Baghdad as part of a campaign the government is calling "Revenge for the Martyrs". But the operations, which have taken place mostly in Sunni districts, have angered the Sunni community and failed to halt the violence. </body>

      <body>Union leaders have voiced optimism after meeting management to discuss the future of the closure-threatened Grangemouth petrochemical plant. The Unite union said it had decided to "embrace" a survival plan put forward by owner Ineos, "warts and all". All 800 employees were told they would lose their jobs when Ineos announced the closure on Wednesday. Workers had rejected proposals by the firm to end their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Speaking after the talks, Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said: "I feel very positive about our objective of making certain that the plant stays open. Obviously now it will be in the hands of Ineos. "I'm optimistic that we will have a positive response from Ineos in the next 24 hours or so." Before the meeting, Ineos director Tom Crotty said the management team at Grangemouth would listen to what the union Unite would be saying. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: "If they believe there is substantial differences in where we are now then clearly they have a duty to take that back to the shareholders." Unite remained hopeful, along with the Scottish and UK governments, that Ineos would reverse its decision. The company had previously said that while further meetings would be held in the coming days to discuss redundancies, there were "no prospects" of returning to conciliation service Acas to revisit the decision to close the petrochemical plant. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney and Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael are expected to hold talks at Grangemouth on Thursday afternoon. Mr Swinney had earlier said that he hoped the talks between the management and union leaders would be "constructive and successful" He said: "I hope that at this very, very, very late stage in the process there is a willingness to listen to and to consider the proposals being put forward. "Everybody is agreed that this plant has a strong future with the necessary investment and that is why the Scottish government is willing to be a player in that." Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest Â£300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Mr Crotty said: "The shareholders, after the vote on Monday, and quite understandably, took a view that if the workforce had rejected that Â£300m investment then how were they going to go ahead and make it if the workforce were not behind that?" About 800 of the 1,370 people directly employed at the Grangemouth complex work at the petrochemical plant, with many more working there as contractors. The dispute at the site, near Falkirk, began over the treatment of a Unite union official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but the operator shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a "survival plan", which was rejected by union members. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. Unite's Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said the union had made further proposals in an effort to "stave off catastrophic job losses". Falkirk Council has announced plans to set up a task force to respond to the closure plans, describing the move as "devastating news" for Grangemouth and the local area. A joint statement from all council members said: "The planned closure will have a massive impact on the future of our communities. "Falkirk Council has a critical role in supporting our communities through this difficult time and we are committed to working together in the best interests of the area. "As well as the 800 Ineos jobs in the petrochemical plant directly affected, the plant is a major contributor to the wider local and national economy. "The future of the refinery in Grangemouth is also under threat. This is of grave concern and it is essential that all parties get round the table again as soon as possible." The statement added that the council was liaising closely with the Scottish and UK governments and was also seeking further talks with Ineos and Unite "as a matter of urgency". </body>

      <title>Poor care risk 'at 1 in 4 hospitals'</title>
      <description>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows.</description>

      <body>A quarter of hospital trusts in England are at raised risk of providing poor care, a review by the regulator shows. The findings are based on monitoring by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) of a host of data, including death rates, serious errors and patient surveys. It found 44 out of 161 trusts fell into the two highest risk categories. The exercise has been carried out as part of the regulator's new hospital inspection regime, which will see inspectors go into every trust by 2015. The first inspections got under way in September and by Christmas the first 18 will have been completed. It will result in every trust being given a rating of either 'outstanding', 'good', 'requires improvement' or 'inadequate' as part of a shake-up in the system ordered after the Stafford Hospital scandal. The CQC said the latest information was not a final judgement, but would be used to prioritise which trusts to inspect earlier in the process. Hospital chief inspector Prof Sir Mike Richards likened the risk review to a form of "screening". He added: "Our intelligent monitoring helps to give us a good picture of risk within trusts, showing us where we need to focus our inspections." The regulator has assessed each trust's performance against up to 150 different indicators. Those performing worse than would be expected on each indicator get marked down as being at risk or elevated risk for that topic. The number of risk scores they have determines which of the bands they are placed in. Bands one and two - those at highest risk - include 24 trusts and 20 trusts respectively. The trusts in band one include the 11 trusts already placed in special measures after a review of high mortality rates. They are joined by Croydon Health Services, which was rated high risk in 12 areas for issues such as patient survey results and whistle-blowing. Also in band one are Barking, Havering and Redbridge, which was rated high risk in 13 areas including AandE waits and patient surveys, and Aintree, rated high risk in 11 areas including an elevated risk for mortality rates. Health Foundation chief executive Dr Jennifer Dixon, who is also a CQC board member, said: "It makes sense to use the wealth of routinely available data in the NHS to try to spot patterns which might identify or predict poor quality care for patients. "The intelligent monitoring tool can never by itself be a crystal ball, but it is a great start and will surely develop over time." Labour Shadow Health Minister Jamie Reed said: "David Cameron should be ashamed that he's put so many of England's hospitals in this position. "He siphoned Â£3bn out of the NHS front-line to blow on a back-office re-organisation nobody voted for. Hospitals were left on a financial knife-edge and they are clearly struggling to maintain standards of patient care after more than three years of chaos." Use the table below to see how your local trust is rated. Select Trust Name to sort alphabetically or Band to sort by band. Each trust has been put into one of six bands. Bands one and two are the ones classed as high risk, while five and six are the lowest risk. Not all the indicators are applicable to every trust - so trusts have only been assessed against the one relevant to them and a proportionate risk score has been calculated. Where serious concerns have been expressed about a trust already, such as being placed in special measures, the organisation is automatically placed in band one regardless of the risk score. The trusts marked with an * are those that have been elevated for this reason. Source: Care Quality Commission </body>

      <title>Primark extends Bangladesh payments</title>
      <description>Discount clothes chain Primark says it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh.</description>

      <body>Discount clothes chain Primark has said it will extend compensation for victims and their families affected by the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh. Primark told the BBC it would continue to pay the wages of those affected for another three months. The collapse, which happened in April, killed more than 1,100 people. International firms have since faced criticism for lack of collective action to improve the working conditions in Bangladeshi garment factories. In addition to the death toll, more than 2,500 were injured in the disaster. Last month, the global trade union IndustriALL called a meeting of some of the world's largest retailers in Geneva to discuss a long-term compensation fund of $74.6m (Â£47.2m) for the workers injured in the disaster, and the families of those who died. However, only nine of the 23 brands being produced at the Rana Plaza factory were represented at the meeting. Key absentees included Wal-Mart and Benetton and the retailers failed to reach a deal on a compensation fund for victims. The garments manufacturing sector is a key driver of Bangladesh's economy. However, a series of incidents has raised concerns over the working conditions in some of the factories in the country. Last November, 112 workers were killed in a fire at another clothes factory in the same area, and nine died in a blaze earlier this month at a garment manufacturer, again near the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka. In September, the BBC's Panorama programme reported that Bangladeshi garment workers had been locked in on 19-hour shifts. As a result, there have been calls to improve the conditions at the units, prompting some action from various stakeholders. But earlier this week, Bangladesh and the International Labour Organisation (ILO) agreed to launch a $24m initiative to improve the conditions of garment workers. In May, many international retailers agreed to a new code of practice regarding safety inspections for factories. At the time of the IndustriALL meeting, Primark said that it would continue to pay wages to those affected by the fire and building collapse for another three months, having paid for the previous three. The new announcement takes the total to nine months. In his first interview with the BBC, Paul Lister, head of corporate governance at Primark's parent company, Associated British Foods, said that "a lot has been done" since the fire to improve standards, and that the events of April were a "huge tragedy". "We looked on in horror. We knew our clothes were in the building, and we accepted responsibility," he said. When asked what he thought about other retailers not participating in compensation schemes, he said there was "still a long way to go" and that it was "time for others to step up". Mr Lister added that Primark would also welcome a rise in the minimum wage for garment workers. The minimum wage for a worker in such a factory is currently around 3,000 Bangladeshi taka a month (about Â£24; $40). When shown a Primark T-shirt costing just Â£2.50 and asked whether selling cheap clothes meant the people making them had to endure low pay and long hours, he said this was not the case, and that Primark's clothes were "ethically sourced". Mr Lister added that Primark and other low-price retailers often shared factory facilities and manufacturing bases with much more expensive brands. "We share 95% of our factories with other high street retailers. We share factories with Bond Street retailers. It's the same conditions, the same workforce, the same pay." "We know the factory where that T-shirt is made, we will have inspected that factory... we often sit outside factories to make sure the timesheets are correct." Mr Lister insisted that although a worker in a Bangladeshi factory would earn around 10p an hour, the garment industry had a positive impact on the country. "There are four million employed [in the textile industry], 80% of Bangladeshi exports are clothes. It is a way to alleviate poverty. It is a force for good." </body>

      <body>The pace of growth among businesses in the eurozone eased in October as the service sector slowed, a survey has indicated. The preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from research firm Markit fell to 51.5 from 52.2 in September. However, a reading above 50 still implies expansion, and activity has now grown for four months in a row. Markit said expansion was "broad-based" across the eurozone, although growth slowed in both Germany and France. Germany - which has been the main economic powerhouse for the eurozone in recent years - saw growth slow to a three-month low. Markit also noted that the eurozone's jobs market remained weak. Employment fell for the 22nd month in a row, with the rate of job losses picking up from September. "The survey data have been running in positive territory for four consecutive months now and indicate that the eurozone economy expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.2% at the start of the fourth quarter, suggesting an ongoing, albeit sluggish, recovery," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Spain's economy - which was one of the hardest hit by the credit crunch and subsequent economic downturn - has shown signs this week that it is slowly starting to recover. Official figures show the country's unemployment rate - which is one of the highest in Europe - fell slightly in the third quarter of this year, to 26% from 26.3% in the previous quarter. On Wednesday, the Bank of Spain said the country's economy had emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years. The bank estimated that Spain's economy grew by 0.1% between July and September. The eurozone emerged from recession in the second quarter of this year when it grew by 0.3% following a record 18 months of economic contraction. However, earlier this month, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi said the recovery in the bloc remained "weak, fragile, uneven". He said further support for the banking sector could not be ruled out, and that the ECB was "ready to consider all available instruments" to maintain financial stability and ensure that recovery in the eurozone took hold. There has been speculation that the ECB might offer another round of cheap, long-term loans to banks to keep the cost of credit down. </body>

      <body>The owner of shoe maker Dr Martens has been bought by the investment firm Permira Funds for Â£300m. R Griggs Group, based in Wollaston, near Northampton, has been making boots since 1901, but became famous with its Dr Martens boot in the 1960s. It will add to Permira's portfolio of fashion businesses which includes Hugo Boss, New Look and Spain's Cortefiel. Griggs was the first firm to use an air-cushioned sole, developed by Munich based Dr Maertens and Dr Funck. The boot that emerged from their collaboration was initially sold as a work boot, but was taken up by the early skinhead youth movement of the 1960s. Dr Martens also credit Peter Townshend, guitarist and songwriter for the Who, as another early adopter. According to the company, Mr Townshend says that, while on tour, he would go to bed with two things: a cognac bottle and a Dr Martens boot. </body>

      <title>Man City referee 'should be banned'</title>
      <description>The referee for Manchester City's game in Moscow should be banned for failing to deal with racist chants, says Kick It Out</description>

      <body>The referee for Manchester City's game against CSKA Moscow should not officiate again after failing to deal with racist abuse, says Kick It Out chairman Lord Ouseley. City's Yaya Toure complained to Ovidiu Hategan about racist chants from CSKA fans during the Champions League win. "The referee should not be refereeing again," Ouseley told BBC Radio 5 live. "He failed to do his duty last night and that is a clear issue that Uefa should be dealing with." Under guidelines issued in 2009 by Uefa - European football's governing body - referees have the power to try to stop racist chanting from supporters. A referee can, as a first step, stop the match and ask for announcements to be made over the public address system. The second step is to suspend the match for a period and, finally, to abandon it. Since Toure reported the abuse to the referee during the game and spoke to him afterwards, the incident will be included in the official's report, which will be sent to Uefa on Thursday. Manchester City have also lodged a formal complaint with Uefa, though the BBC's Moscow correspondent Steve Rosenberg said CSKA Moscow claim Toure was the only person to hear the chants. Lord Ouseley, who heads Kick It Out,Â  one of the leading anti-discrimination bodies in England, continued: "Firstly, why did the ref not do his job which was to stop the game and to make sure that problem was dealt with?" And he added that the incident would also test new sanctions issued by Uefa. In May, it announced that, in the case of racist incidents involving spectators, a partial stadium closure would be applied for the first offence and a full stadium closure for a second, coupled with a fine of 50,000 euros (Â£42,800). "[Uefa] need to enforce the regulations that have been brought into play to deal with these type of offences and this will be a test for Uefa. "Will they do what they have always done and have sanctions that are applied in a way that will not stop this happening again? And if they don't do that, it brings the question: what are clubs going to do to protect their players? What is the union going to do to protect their players?" Ouseley said that if players were not adequately protected, there could be more cases of them walking off the pitch, as when former AC Milan player Kevin Prince-Boateng forced the abandonment of a friendly match between his side and an Italian lower division team over racist abuse. "It seems to me the only alternative is to provide them with the power to do what Prince-Boateng did last season with Milan and walk off the pitch because this is the only way we can bring sanity to the situation," he added. "This has gone on for too long. Uefa and Fifa take us for mugs, and that can't go on any longer." </body>

      <body>India's Supreme Court will hear a petition on Friday which is seeking the cancellation of this weekend's Indian Grand Prix. The petition was filed on the grounds that the organisers have allegedly not paid taxes for a previous event. "We will hear the petition tomorrow," said Chief Justice P. Sathasivam. A spokesman for the circuit's owner, Jaypee Sports International Limited, said: "Whatever the court says, we are ready to follow." Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who leads rival Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by 90 points with 100 still available, could clinch his fourth title in India this Sunday. The German, who has led every racing lap at the Indian Grand Prix since its debut in 2011, will triumph if he finishes fifth or higher, regardless of where Alonso finishes. The Supreme Court in India has executive powers and ordered circuit bosses two years ago to freeze 25% of ticket revenues until they had settled an outstanding tax dispute. That ruling followed Public Interest Litigation filed by campaigner Amit Kumar, the same man who is behind Thursday's petition. The long-term future of the Indian Grand Prix is already uncertain after F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone removed the race from the 2014 calendar. Organisers are trying to find a new date for its return in 2015, with Ecclestone keen for the race to take place in the early part of the season, rather than its current October date. </body>

      <body>Legendary commentator Richie Benaud is recovering in hospital after the car he was driving hit a brick wall in Sydney. The 83-year-old former Australia captainÂ  sustained chest and shoulder injuries driving alone to his home in Coogee after playing golf. "No-one was injured. I was more worried about the car than myself," Benaud said of his vintage 1963 Sunbeam Alpine. Benaud has commentated since ending his playing days in 1964 and is due to work on the Ashes, starting on 21 November. Channel Nine Entertainment chief executive officer David Gyngell said: "Richie is a national treasure. In the Nine family, he sits at the head of the table. "As always, he and (wife) Daphne have our support and Richie will return to call the coming Ashes series against England - his 36th summer in Nine's Wide World of Sports commentary box - when he is good and ready." A statement on Channel Nine's Facebook pageÂ  said Benaud's vehicle mounted a verge before crashing into the wall. Police attended the incident but no charges were laid. "Richie's remarkable," his wife Daphne was quoted as saying. "At first I was quite concerned but today he's looking unbelievably well." </body>

      <title>Tim Rice unveils Eternity musical</title>
      <description>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked".</description>

      <body>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked". The adaptation of James Jones' uncensored 1951 novel is Sir Tim's first totally new musical for 13 years. Written with composer Stuart Brayson, the story follows the love affairs of US soldiers stationed in Hawaii in the run up to the attack on Pearl Harbour. The new version includes swearing, nudity and a scene in a gay bar. Some of the more explicit scenes will come as a surprise to fans of the 1953 Oscar-winning film, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, which included a famous scene in which the couple share a passionate clinch on a beach. "The film was wonderful but it was made in 1953 and, 67 years on, we can take different aspects of the book and look at it through 21st Century eyes," Sir Tim told the BBC after Wednesday's opening night. "Some people might be mildly shocked but I think we've all got used to a bit of that these days. It's quite mild compared with Book of Mormon or even Billy Elliot." The cast includes Darius Campbell as Sergeant Warden, Rebecca Thornhill as his married lover Karen Holmes, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, Siubhan Harrison as his lover Lorene, and Ryan Sampson as Private Maggio. Campbell said that, during previews, there had been some walkouts from the show due to its content. "The James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. We've explored that in a way that's very real and gritty, and honours the story." The Scottish singing star, who shot to fame as Darius Danesh on TV show Pop Idol, went on: "It hasn't been without some of the older audience walking out. "Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film - and wanted to see more - have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." 'Quite dangerous' Sir Tim Rice is best known for his partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber on shows such as Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. Lord Lloyd-Webber's new West End musical Stephen Ward is due to open in December. Sir Tim confirmed that his former writing partner had already seen a preview of From Here to Eternity. "He was very complimentary and I'm hoping to see his show," he said. Sir Tim's last full musical was 2000's Aida, which he wrote with Elton John. The pair had earlier worked together on The Lion King. From Here to Eternity sees the Oscar-winning lyricist team up with the relatively unknown Brayson. The pair first met in the 1980s when Brayson approached Sir Tim in the street and asked him to listen one of his songs on cassette. "I played it in car on way home. I rang him up and said this is rather good. I couldn't do much to help his pop career but when he began writing musicals I thought, 'maybe I can help,'" Sir Tim said. Although Sir Tim hadn't intended to be involved in writing the musical, as the production took shape he "ended up doing all the lyrics apart from one or two lines". Brayson told the BBC: "I must have sent him eight or nine musicals and this was the one that he really went for. "We didn't set out to do the movie. We set out out to do something that was different and quite dangerous in parts." In the audience on Wednesday night was James Jones' daughter, Kaylie, and her brother, Jamie. "We had our doubts when the idea first came up," she admitted after the show "but I'm thrilled - it's so sophisticated and moving." She added: "I was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes because my dad said this is just the way it was back then. "I think my father would have been amazed." From Here to Eternity, directed by Tamara Harvey, is booking at the Shaftesbury Theatre , London, until 26 April 2014. </body>

      <body>Dark Knight Rises star Tom Hardy will play Sir Elton John in a biopic of the singer's life called Rocketman, it has been announced. The 36-year-old British actor previously played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and has starred in films such as Inception, Lawless and Bronson. Rocketman is being made with the co-operation of Sir Elton, 66, who is an executive producer on the project. It will begin shooting in late 2014, Focus Features said. The screenplay has been penned by Lee Hall, who was Oscar-nominated for Billy Elliot, and recently worked on the film adaptation of War Horse. It follows Reginald Dwight's journey from childhood piano prodigy to global superstar, under his stage name Elton John. Hardy is respected for his wide-ranging talent, but his brawny, tattooed frame makes him an unconventional choice to star as the flamboyant musician. He is not the first actor to play Sir Elton. In 2001, Justin Timberlake appeared as a "young Elton" in the video for the latter's This Train Don't Stop There Any More. Last month, Sir Elton John played live at the Emmy Awards ceremony for the first time. He performed a tribute to Liberace, the American pianist and vocalist whose life was told in the recent biopic, Behind the Candelabra. </body>

      <description>The Japanese men who prefer virtual girlfriends to sex</description>

      <body>Unless something happens to boost Japan's birth rate, its population will shrink by a third between now and 2060. One reason for the lack of babies is the emergence of a new breed of Japanese men - the otaku, who love manga, anime and computers more than sex. Tokyo is the world's largest metropolis and home to more than 35 million people, so on the face of it, it is hard to believe there is any kind of population problem at all. But Akihabara, an area of the city dedicated to the manga and anime subculture provides one clue to the country's problems. Akihabara is heaven for otaku. They are a generation of geeks who have grown up through 20 years of economic stagnation and have chosen to tune out and immerse themselves in their own fantasy worlds. Kunio Kitamara, of the Japan Family Planning Association, describes many young Japanese men as "herbivores" - passive and lacking carnal desire. It seems they no longer have the ambition of the post-war alpha males who made Japan such an economic powerhouse and no interest in joining a company and becoming a salary man. They have taken on a mole-like existence and, worryingly, withdrawn from relationships with the opposite sex. A survey by the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in 2010 found 36% of Japanese males aged 16 to 19 had no interest in sex - a figure that had doubled in the space of two years. I met two otaku, who believe themselves to be in relationships with virtual girlfriends. This girlfriend is actually a Nintendo computer game called Love Plus, which comes as a small portable tablet. Nurikan and Yuge take their girlfriends, Rinko and Ne-ne, on actual dates to the park, and buy them cakes to celebrate their birthdays. "It's the kind of relationship we wish we'd had at high school," says Nurikan. In the game he is a 15-year-old, though in reality he is 38. "As long as I have time, I'll continue the relationship forever," says Yuge, who is 39. "As she's at high school, she picks me up in the morning and we go to school together. After school we meet at the gates and go home together... In the game I am 17." Yuge says he often puts Ne-ne - or the games console containing her - into the basket of his bicycle, then he takes photographs of them at his destination. Though Yuge would like to meet a real woman, and Nurikan is married, they say this is easier than having a real girlfriend. "At high school you can have relationships without having to think about marriage," says Yuge. "With real girlfriends you have to consider marriage. So I think twice about going out with a 3D woman." Nurikan says he keeps Rinko a secret from his wife, and hopes he never has to choose between them. It's hard to avoid feeling that otaku are in a perpetual state of childhood and are quite comfortable with their lives this way. Exactly why they have retreated into fantasy land is not obvious. Tokyo-based social commentator Roland Kelts says many young Japanese men are pessimistic about the future. They don't believe they will match their parents' wealth and don't want to commit themselves to relationships. "If you compare China or Vietnam, most of those kids on scooters going to nightclubs, and dancing their heart away and perhaps having sex - they know it's getting better, they know they are probably going to rock their parents' income," he says. "No-one in Japan feels that way." Several surveys have shown that even when Japanese men and women are in relationships, they have very little sex. In one survey just 27% said they had sex every week. Marriage rates are also plunging, and very few babies - only 2% - are born out of wedlock. Japan's demographic timebomb is also linked to the lack of immigration. In Britain one in eight people were born abroad, compared to one in 60 in Japan. But immigration in Japan is still heavily restricted, despite a dearth of some qualified workers. In Britain there are 60,000 healthcare workers from overseas, while in Japan - where there is a serious shortage of nurses - there are only 60. Japan has managed to preserve its unique culture in an increasingly globalised world but could that very sense of identity stand in the way of solving its population problems? Or is it just time for Japanese men to grow up, have more sex and make more babies? Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</title>
      <description>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24463736</url>
      <date>1382570447</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70378000/jpg/_70378882_70375108.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

      <body>The military hat still hangs proudly on the wall of Major Win Naing Kyaw's house, on a peg just beneath what is clearly a favourite picture. The major, in sunglasses, stands stiffly, staring out sternly; next to him is his wife, Khin Moe San, with an infectiously radiant smile. Smiles are now in very short supply. Khin Moe San has just been to visit her husband in prison. "He's not well", she says, shaking her head, before telling me he's been "sad and depressed" since President Barack Obama visited Burma (also known as Myanmar) last year. High-level foreign visits are often accompanied by prisoner releases and this trip was no different. Of the 10 political prisoners serving life in the major's block in prison, nine were allowed to go free. Only he was left behind. "The government clearly hates him," Khin Moe San told me sadly. The major certainly has powerful enemies. Four years ago, he was arrested at Rangoon (also known as Yangon) airport. After spending weeks in jail, he confessed to leaking sensitive details of Burma's military ties with North Korea to journalists. Under a law more than 60 years old, he was sentenced to death for revealing state secrets. As is now common in Burma, the sentence was then commuted to life imprisonment. Khin Moe San tells me her husband's confession was forced, made after he had been deprived of food, water and sleep, and his family had been threatened. Whatever the truth, the major is considered by many to be a political prisoner. Earlier this year Burma's president set up a special committee to identify political prisoners and submit recommendations to the government as to who should go free. But those like the major, who are put on the list, are not necessarily freed. For all the talk of democracy, it's not hard to guess who's blocking his release - the Burmese army is still hugely powerful. Not many of the 133 names still on the latest list of political prisoners are straightforward. Often, the issue is about what exactly makes a prisoner "political". Some human rights groups are unhappy that those who have taken part in violence are included. What if someone has been party to the most brutal of atrocities - should they be ruled out? In a dingy room on the outskirts of Rangoon, I met up with one of the daughters of a student leader called U Sein. She showed me the only picture the family have of their father - a fresh-faced man from another era. In the 1970s and 80s, U Sein worked as part of the resistance against the dictatorship and then joined a rebel group called the All Burma Students' Democratic Front. On the frontline in the northern mountains, relations between the young fighters soured. U Sein was among a group accused of being government spies. Fifteen were executed outright. The rest were buried up to their waists in the ground - beaten and left exposed to the elements for more than a week. Having dreamed of bringing democracy to Burma, U Sein and 19 others ended up being tortured to death by their own side. One of the men leading the students' interrogation and torture in the mountains was called Than Gyoung. He is now in jail. But much to the horror of the tortured students' families, he may not be there much longer. Activists consider Than Gyoung to be a political prisoner - his name has been put forward by the committee for release. Bo Kyi, himself a former political prisoner, said he considers all of the students, including Than Gyoung, to be victims of the system at the time - the products of a brutal military dictatorship, and the suspicion and paranoia it created. Bo Kyi wants Than Gyoung released and then a meeting held with the families of the students, so that the killer can explain his actions and they can, he hopes, be reconciled. If it happened, it would be an isolated example of Burma delving into its traumatic recent past. The tentative democratic changes that have taken placed here in the last three years have been made possible by looking to the future, to avoid upsetting the army and its vested interests. All are acutely aware that scratching too deep or looking too closely at recent history could threaten Burma's still-fragile reforms.

      <title>John Carpenter reflects on Halloween</title>
      <description>John Carpenter's horror masterpiece Halloween turns 35</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24296254</url>

      <body>In 1978, a low-budget film about a masked killer stalking a young babysitter in a quiet Illinois suburb took the film industry by storm. Filmed for just over $300,000 (about $1m today), John Carpenter's Halloween has since made more than $47m. Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. "I can believe it," says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. "I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid." Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, "was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders". "The idea was that every American girl can relate to that." After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. "The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was," says the director. "I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it. And I had the movie figured out and it was a lot of fun." Although the idea of a stalking killer was not a new one, having been seen in films like Michael Powell's voyeuristic Peeping Tom; Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13 and even Tobe Hooper's creation Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween's Myers was a different beast. "We had this idea of Michael Myers being not quite a human but almost a supernatural force," says Carpenter. "Evil as a force of nature in the personification of this man. "So we put him in a mask so he wouldn't have human features." The two-dollar rubber mask was a likeness of Star Trek actor William Shatner, sprayed a bluish-white - and it terrified people. "The best compliment I got was standing outside a theatre and hearing the audience scream, that was just delightful." Halloween ushered in the era of the slasher movies of the 1980s. Though they were not the first, it - along with Friday 13th - brought the previously niche horror genre hurtling into the mainstream. Carpenter, however, plays down his reputation as the father of the genre: "I think the main reason that Halloween inspired other movies was very shrewd producers looking and saying, 'This idiot made this for $300,000, we can do it and make money'. "It's all about making money in Hollywood. It wasn't about art." The slasher genre now looks relatively timid when compared with the explosion in what became known as the "torture porn" of the 2000s. Super-violent films such as Hostel and the Saw franchise undoubtedly built on the brutal nature of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Since then, filmmakers have returned to the basics with ghost films like The Conjuring and The Woman In Black, which have proved to be a massive draw at the box office. But Carpenter - who has dabbled in ghostly tales such as The Fog and Christine - again insists: "Horror films have been around since the beginning of cinema and each one leads to another so they continue to morph and change depending on society. "None of this is new, there have always been ghost stories. There are just new ways of telling stories." Though horror makes up the main body of Carpenter's work, the director has branched out into other genres such as the comedy-action of Big Trouble in Little China and the romance of Starman - which earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination. His influence on a younger generation of filmmakers can been seen, in particular in the work of Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn of Drive fame. In a recent BBC interview, he voiced his love for Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York - starring Kurt Russell as the anti-hero Cyclops Snake Plissken whose mission is to rescue the US president from the Big Apple - now a maximum security prison. "God, I loved that movie," said Refn. "It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulsey beat." Carpenter, roaring with laughter, is clearly delighted with the compliment: "Hell yes," he cackles. "Who wouldn't be?" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Carpenter is blessed indeed, for alongside the seven sequels to Halloween, no fewer than four of his films have been remade in recent years, with an adaptation of Escape from New York long rumoured. British actors Jason Statham and Tom Hardy are believed to be front-runners to take over the role of Plissken. "I'm mostly extremely excited, especially when they have to pay me money," says Carpenter. "I made my films and the remakes are the remakes, so its fine with me." After 43 years in the film business, Carpenter is now semi-retired but offers a word of advice to young filmmakers. "The biggest challenge is surviving the movie business and making films despite all the obstacles in your way," he says. "Nobody tells you how to survive. "I don't know if I'm as hungry as I was. I'm not as driven as I was, my entire life's goal was to become a professional director and I did that, I've nothing left to prove to myself." A 35th anniversary edition of Halloween is out on 21 October. </body>

      <title>Mixed marriages in China a labour of love</title>
      <description>The challenges of mixed marriages in China</description>

      <body>"From the first time I started to love a Chinese man, hiding became part of my life," says American Jocelyn Eickenburg. She had moved to Shanghai in 2003 to be with her now-husband Jun Yu. "In the past, students had been expelled for dating or marrying foreigners. We didn't know what would happen if the university administration found out, so we told no-one he was living off-campus with me," she says. A foreign woman with a Chinese man is a rare pairing. Within her small expat community the social isolation was almost immediate. She felt alienated by her girlfriends, who would openly express their distaste for Chinese men. "I felt alone in being married to a Chinese man and I wanted to find other people to connect with," says Ms Eickenburg about her decision in 2009 to share her experiences on her blog, Speaking of China. She says she now receives scores of emails a month from Chinese people curious about meeting and dating foreigners, or partners new to, or experiencing difficulties, in cross-cultural relationships. In 1978, there was not a single inter-racial marriage registered in mainland China, according to government figures. But the numbers of Chinese marrying foreigners has gradually risen, with 53,000 such couples tying the knot in 2012. Jun's parents married in 1971 during Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution (1966-76), when China was closed to the world. It was a time when public displays of affection were punished and any discussion of sex was considered Western spiritual pollution. To his parents' generation it was inconceivable to marry a foreigner. But that all changed with reform and China's "opening up", says Richard Burger, former editor of a state-run newspaper in Beijing and author of Behind The Red Door: Sex in China. A sexual revolution has taken place in China; from the way people are dressing, couples holding hands in the streets in main cities, and young people becoming less inhibited about sex. A factor in this revolution is that young Chinese people increasingly have greater autonomy from their parents in choosing a partner, Mr Burger says. "For me to date and marry a Western woman was rebellious in a sense," says Jun, recalling that his father had cautioned him that foreigners could be friends but never lovers or wives. More often than not Chinese families are wary or disappointed by such unions, but Jun says he was fortunate that as the youngest of three brothers his parents were more permissive. By contrast, Jun is known as "the legend" amongst his peers as they generally regard having a Western wife as a "status symbol", he says. But when it comes to cross-cultural marriage, far more Chinese women date or marry Western men than the other way around. One of China's most famous scholars of sex, Li Yinhe, says one possibility is that Chinese men lack confidence. Mr Burger agrees saying: "Men are engrained with a cultural imprint and are brought up to believe that they are the head of the household, they have the power. "It is very intimidating approaching a Western woman, who has a perceived higher level of education, more money or earning power, and greater sexual experience." It is in China's big cities that the surge in inter-racial relationships is most apparent. When Yue Xu, an actress and self-styled dating guru, returned to her native Beijing in 2012 after years living in the US, she was struck by the increase in expats in the capital, and the number of Western men dating Chinese women. "In the West, Asian women are portrayed as exotic beauties; a librarian in public but kinky in the bedroom. In China, the Western fantasy meets reality," she says. "Chinese women are brought up to be the care takers - they know how to look after their men. But in most households it's the woman who makes all the major financial decisions." Yue says that in general Chinese women have become far more aggressive when it comes to dating, something she attributes to social pressure and the fear of being labelled a "left-over woman" at 27. But she says the media - movies, television shows, online dating sites - also play a role. "There is a mindset 'If I'm going to find love, I need to find it myself. No-one else can do it for me'," she says. A number of high-profile mixed couples have captured headlines in China and the West, perhaps driving the trend. Wendi Deng, who became known as the 'tiger wife', was married to media tycoon Rupert Murdoch for 14 years before their split in June. Earlier this year, British actor Hugh Grant announced the birth of his second child with Chinese partner Tinglan Hong. The West captured the imagination of Yong Zhi as a young girl growing up in Beijing. She "dreamed of travelling abroad". An "addiction" to Western novels inspired her to study English Literature at the prestigious Jilin University in north-east China. "I was dating but half-heartedly. I'd made it clear to my Chinese boyfriend that I wanted to go abroad so there was a limit as to where our relationship could go." Yong met her husband David within two months of arriving in the UK to study at the University of Liverpool. She is celebrating 16 years of marriage. She says she knows of educated, good-looking women who go to certain bars in the hope of meeting a Western man to marry. "They have an image in their head and want to live 'the dream'." A mixed marriage can offer greater opportunities to travel and educate your children overseas. Being able to speak English elevates you in terms of salary and job opportunities, she says. But cross-cultural marriage can be tricky, says a relationship counsellor at the non-profit Community Center Shanghai (CCS), who gave her name as Aiching. Life plans, communication, emotional management and acceptance of cultural differences are common issues. "The couples I have counselled married or dated because they fell in love. But they still have to face the challenges and struggles of daily life. "I do not focus too much on that they are from different races. People tend to use it as the easiest excuse to give up on trying to help their marriages," she says. Aiching says she helps couples to talk about their feelings - something which is "kind of taboo" for Chinese - and to understand one another's cultures. Jocelyn says there was a time in her relationship with Jun when stress, personal issues and cultural differences collided to create a "perfect storm". "When you're in love with someone from another culture, when you treat them as your equal, it's easy to forget that you learned different ways to respond to problems, and different ways to communicate," she writes in her blog. "What I've learned is that I can lose my temper if Jun doesn't understand what I'm trying to say - and Jun, on the other hand, can stonewall me at a time when I most need him to talk." The couple, however, weathered that storm. They plan to live in China permanently and hope to give Jun's parents a longed-for grandchild. </body>

      <title>Ethiopia's leather industry booming</title>
      <description>Ethiopia's hide industry bids to grow with UK help</description>

      <body>Amid the rhythmic clicking of rows and rows of sewing machines, hundreds of workers are busy creating a range of leather gloves, bags and jackets. "I can tell when employees' skills have improved by the noises of the machines speeding up," says Tsedenia Mekbib, a general manager. We are at a busy factory on the outskirts of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It is one of three such facilities in the city owned by UK leather goods company Pittards, which has a long history of operating in the country. While an increasing number of Western firms of all sizes are now looking at doing business in Africa, Pittards has had a 90-year head start. The company, which is based in Yeovil, Somerset, in the south-west of England, has been trading in Ethiopia since the 1920s. And it is all down to a celebrated type of sheep - the Ethiopian hair sheep. This breed, which does not grow a thick coat of wool, also has much thinner skin than its European brethren, making it ideal for delicate leather apparel such as ladies' gloves. Pittards now has ambitious plans to grow its Ethiopian operations, which help contribute towards the firm's Â£39m ($60m) annual revenues. At present its Addis Ababa-based factories and tannery to the south of the city employ about 1,200 locals, a number expected to grow to about 5,000 within five years. A fourth factory has already been built, and is waiting to be occupied. On the current production floors, an element of handwork is also included in the manufacturing process, which each month produces 100,000 work gloves and 5,000 dress gloves. Pittards' Ethiopian factories also produce two million sq feet (186,000 sq m) of quality leather for export to be made into garments ranging from specialist golf gloves to couture handbags. "Ethiopia will grow in importance to Pittards and the global leather industry [in general]," says the company's chief executive Reg Hankey. Ethiopia's attractions for Pittards, and other Western firms, include the country's large pool of relatively low-cost labour. It also has duty-free status for most manufactured products for export to Europe, the US and other countries. Despite Ethiopia having the largest flock of hair sheep in the world - more than 26 million - it is not the largest supplier of skins. Its flock's reproductive rate of about 37% trails New Zealand's 180% and means Ethiopia has only some 9.5 million sheepskins available annually compared with New Zealand's total of about 30 million. Better animal husbandry should increase Ethiopia's supply. Pittards is already involved in environmental programmes to improve the quality of local skins through improved husbandry and treatment against parasites. Another benefit could be improved meat yields, a not insignificant detail while Ethiopia remains a developing country. Regarding the wider issues of doing business in Ethiopia, Mr Hankey says the country faces the same challenges as other developing nations, encompassing difficulties related to bureaucracy, customs and banking. Yet, he adds, while more has to be done, the situation is greatly improved. "Ethiopia has come a very long way over the last 23 years since I first visited, and the last decade in particular has witnessed massive positive changes," Mr Hankey says. "Ethiopia has worked very hard to establish itself as a preferred country for economic development within Africa." Ethiopia's government now wants to grow its leather industry's annual exports to $500m by the completion of its five-year growth and transformation plan at the end of 2015. Leather exports stood at $123m last year. Within Pittards, the British management is happy to be playing a part in Ethiopia reaching its ambitious goal. "We have put down roots," Mr Hankey says. "This changes relationships and thinking - we see things from the inside and the outside, giving us a unique position for further development." Busy at work in the Pittards factory is 20-year-old Embret Beshada. Her job is to sew two glove-shaped panels together while incorporating material to create a thumb casing. She says she found the work easy when she started just over a year ago, despite having to learn many new skills, and was producing gloves within two months. "Being able to support myself excites me the most," she says. Sitting at sewing machines nearby are some of her friends. About 80% of the factory workforce is female, while at the tannery about 80% of the workforce is male. "We are seeing people get more jobs, and people's lifestyles changing, which gives us hope for the future," Ms Beshada adds. </body>

      <title>Roma case raises child concerns</title>
      <description>Fears that Roma child case may resurrect 'old myths'</description>

      <body>The high-profile case a young girl in Greece has highlighted the treatment of children in Roma communities across Europe. DNA tests conducted in central Greece on a blonde-haired girl known as Maria have shown that the couple looking after her were not her biological parents. Tests were also carried out on a girl taken into care in Dublin, although they have concluded that she was living with her biological parents. Police had initially not been persuaded by the birth certificate and passport provided by the family, reports said. Both stories, one on the western fringes of Europe and the other in the east, involve blonde-haired girls with disputed documents. "Not all Roma communities have dark skin: there are Roma who have light skin and green eyes," says Dezideriu Gergely, head of the Budapest-based European Roma Rights Centre. He is concerned about the dangers of racial profiling and insists Maria's case in Greece should be viewed as unusual. While it is not uncommon for children to be raised by extended families, for example by grandparents, Mr Gergely considers it rare for children to be brought up beyond their biological families. "Definitely there is a need for an answer. Something was not right and that is for the court to investigate." What alarms him is the labelling of an entire community. There has been widespread interest in Maria, particularly because of the high-profile disappearances of two British blonde-haired children: Madeleine McCann in Portugal in 2007 and Ben Needham on the Greek island of Kos in 1991. Indeed, the authorities have themselves internationalised the story with Interpol asking 190 countries to check for a possible match to Maria's DNA, to assess whether she has been a victim of child abduction or trafficking. Mr Gergely believes the latest cases may resurrect old hatreds and myths of babies being stolen. Roma in already-marginalised communities such as Serbia have complained of racial discrimination. But he does acknowledge that the Roma may have been exposed to child traffickers. "It's true the Roma are a vulnerable group because of extreme poverty, low income and low levels of education. But it's not related to cultural factors or to do with the Roma community, let's say, getting involved in trafficking." The UN children's agency Unicef has told the BBC that Roma communities are often used by traffickers because they are seen as "under the radar of society". As many as 3,000 children in Greece are in the hands of child-trafficking rings originating in Bulgaria, Romania and other Balkan countries, Unicef says. Most cases are not thought to involve abduction but rather the buying and selling of children for a few thousand euros. Part of the problem in Greece appears to lie in its localised and out-of-date child-registration system. And yet, ever since the mid-1990s, the European Union has tried to ensure all Roma communities across Europe are fully registered. Most Roma, some 95%, are in settled communities in the EU and both Maria's case and that of the girl in the Tallaght suburb of Dublin involve settled families. In other words, there is no obvious need for paperwork problems. But for all the efforts to bring Roma families into national databases, many are still clearly beyond the system. The couple who registered Maria, according to the Greek authorities, used false identification and claimed to have had six children in under 10 months. And Greece's supreme court has called for an urgent investigation across the country into birth certificates issued since 2008. The prosecutor's order warns that Maria's case may not be unique. "This could have happened in other parts of the country," it warns. In Ireland, too, there are concerns about the registration system, which have alarmed Siobhan Curran, Roma project co-ordinator at the Pavee Point travellers and Roma centre. She has seen many in Ireland's 5,000 Roma population struggle to get hold of social benefits because of what she sees as "very harsh criteria" needed to meet what is known as the habitual residence condition. Poor literacy and language can also be a problem for Roma looking for a job when they try to register for the Personal Public Service number (PPS), required for tax purposes. She describes a vicious cycle where families are unable to obtain a medical card because they are unable to prove they are entitled to one. When they fail to take a child to a local doctor for care, social services are then called in. "Social workers have contacted us with very serious child protection concerns. They have told us in some cases they have very little option but to take a child into care to give them access to services." Although Ireland historically has been known for its traveller community, many Roma arrived only in recent years looking for a better life when countries such as Slovakia, Poland and the Czech Republic entered the EU. Europe's total Roma population is thought to be as high as 10-12 million, with Turkey having an estimated population of 2.75 million and Romania with some 1.85 million. Siobhan Curran warns against sensationalising the Roma issue. "Any child protection case has to be taken seriously," she says. "But we need to challenge the starting point that there's a connection between Roma and child trafficking." </body>
