      <body>The UN's humanitarian chief has called for an "immediate pause in hostilities" in Moadamiyah, a rebel-held suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Valerie Amos said 3,000 people were evacuated last Sunday, but that the same number were trapped in the town amid continuing shelling and fighting. Thousands of people were in a similar situations in towns across the country, she said. The army has previously said rebel-held areas must surrender or starve. Also on Saturday, activists said at least 16 soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing and fighting at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In a statement, Baroness Amos said was "extremely worried by the situation unfolding across Syria where ordinary women, children and men are facing horrific violence and brutality from all sides of the conflict". She said relief workers had been unable to access Moadamiyah for months, and that the ongoing conflict was preventing any rescue mission from going ahead. "I call on all parties to agree an immediate pause in hostilities in Moadamiyah to allow humanitarian agencies unhindered access to evacuate the remaining civilians and deliver life-saving treatment and supplies in areas where fighting and shelling is ongoing," she said. But she said this was not the only area of concern, citing Nubil, Zahra, old Aleppo town, old Homs town and Hassakeh as other places where people were in danger. "Civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attack," she added. "It is vital that all parties to the conflict respect their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian laws to protect civilians and to allow neutral, impartial humanitarian organizations safe access to all people in need, wherever they are in Syria." Moadamiyah and at least two other Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk and Eastern Ghouta - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. Syrian activists say they are now starting to record the first deaths of complications caused by malnutrition. On Friday, the US urged the Syrian government to allow relief convoys to reach starving civilians. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year. The unrest began in the midst of the Arab Spring regional uprisings, with protests against President Bashar Assad, before degenerating into civil war. A British surgeon who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks told the BBC on Friday that he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. David Nott said there "was definitely a game going on between the snipers". "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." Most of the unborn babies and many of the women did not survive, he said. International efforts to halt the violence have consistently faltered, but last month the UN Security Council broke its deadlock, voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. The move followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August. UN experts are currently working in Syria, inspecting chemical weapons sites and destroying the arsenal, and say they have completed almost half their mission. </body>

      <title>Roma girl 'can return to France'</title>
      <description>A Roma girl whose deportation sparked protests can return from Kosovo to finish her studies, but her family cannot, French President Hollande says.</description>

      <body>French President Francois Hollande has said a Roma girl who was removed from her school bus and deported can return to finish her studies, but that her family cannot. Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was expelled along with her parents and five siblings earlier this month after they lost their battle for asylum in France. The case has sparked protests by student groups across the country. A government investigation ruled that the deportation had been legal. But the report, released on Saturday, said any future such action against school children should be taken outside school hours. The Dibrani family left Kosovo for France five years ago and were living in Levier, in the Doubs region of eastern France. They cited discrimination in Kosovo as grounds for asylum. An order for their expulsion was issued after they lost their battle for asylum. After two postponements, it was rescheduled for October and the father, who was detained in a different town, was expelled on 8 October. Leonarda had stayed at a friend's overnight so was not at the family home when border police arrived to deport them. She was instead taken away by police in front of other students while on a field trip. The whole family were flown back to Kosovo that day. Mr Hollande told French TV: "If she makes a request, because of the circumstances, and because she wants to pursue her schooling in France, a welcome will be extended to her." But he stressed that the invitation was to Leonarda alone. The girl has said she will not return to France without her family. "I will not abandon my family. I'm not the only one who has to go to school, there are also my brothers and sisters," the AFP news agency quoted her as saying. Leonarda's father, Resat Dibrani, told reporters in Mitrovica, where the family are now living, that they would not stay in Kosovo. "I have no freedom here for myself, my children and my family. The police can say whatever they want, but for me, justice does not work in France." But he said the family would not be split up by his daughter going alone. "Either we all go together or nobody goes." Mr Dibrani had admitted this week that he had lied about the children's origins in the hope of boosting their asylum application - only he is from Kosovo but his wife and six children were all born in Italy. The mayor of the Italian town of Fano, where the family lived for several years, said they left after the authorities there threatened to take the children into care. "The children hardly ever went to school even though he had signed them up. He sent them out begging. They lived in the streets," Stefano Aguzzi told AFP. "We told him that he could not continue living here without paying for anything. We gave him a set of rules for him to be able to stay." Mr Aguzzi said that if the family returned, Fano officials would "not welcome them back with open arms" but that would "consider them like we do all the other immigrants". Hundreds of French students have staged protests against the deportation, and the manner in which Leonarda was removed, in Paris and other cities. Much of the anger has been directed at Interior Minister Manuel Valls, previously a popular figure. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says Mr Valls has also faced bitter recriminations from within his own party, accused of betraying the principles of the socialist government. But the government was also warned by the right-wing opposition that if it caved into the protests and allowed the family back, it would set a dangerous precedent, says our correspondent. Mr Hollande's invitation to Leonarda is perhaps the president's best way out of damaging few days, he adds. </body>

      <body>At least 10 people have been killed after a small tourist plane crashed near the city of Namur in south-east Belgium. It was carrying a group of skydivers and crashed shortly after take-off, killing all those on board, the local mayor has told the AFP news agency. The plane is thought to have taken off from the Temploux aerodrome and crashed around 10 minutes later in a field. Its wing appeared to have suffered some damage, Belgian media report. The small plane came down near the village of Marchovelette, 10km (six miles) from Namur. The passengers did not have time to jump out, the mayor of the nearby town of Fernelmont told AFP. Pictures show black smoke billowing from a burnt-out fuselage. "I just saw a plane lose its right wing in mid-flight and crash. I heard a massive 'bang' towards the south of Marchovelette," one witness told Belgian television. "I didn't see anyone escape with a parachute," the witness added. </body>

      <body>At least 16 people have been killed and more than 30 injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded restaurant in the central Somali town of Beledweyne. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack. The Somali government, backed by troops from several African countries, is fighting al-Shabab for control of the country. Al-Shabab said its target was Ethiopian and Djiboutian soldiers in Beledweyne. The bombing occurred at a tea shop popular with the troops in Beledweyne, 300km (185 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, close to the border with Ethiopia. "Our main target was Ethiopian and Djibouti troops who invaded our country," Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, said. But witnesses, including a Somali MP in Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jessow, have told the BBC that most of those killed were civilians. "There is a lack of medicine in the hospital and they can't cope with the flood of wounded patients, so we asked the central government to send us planes to evacuate patients," Mr Jessow said by phone. Al-Shabab militants have been driven out of Somalia's major towns, including Mogadishu and the key southern port of Kismayo, by a UN-mandated African Union force of some 18,000 soldiers. But the militants still control large parts of southern Somalia. Last month, the group claimed the attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in which 67 people died during a four-day siege. It said it staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. </body>

      <body>A court in Milan has banned Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, from holding public office for two years, following his conviction for tax fraud. However, the ban must be approved by parliament before taking effect. Earlier this month, a cross-party panel of the Italian Senate recommended his expulsion from the chamber. Berlusconi had threatened to topple the coalition government over the issue but backed down during a confidence vote. If he is expelled from the senate, he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. He will also spend a year under house arrest, or doing community service - his preferred option, according to a request he formally submitted last week. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi, 77, was convicted over deals his firm Mediaset made to purchase TV rights to US films. He was sentenced to four years in prison, automatically reduced to one under a 2006 pardon act. He was also banned from holding public office for five years. The sentence was upheld in August. </body>

      <title>Greek police appeal over blonde girl</title>
      <description>Greek police investigate the identity of a young blonde girl found living with an unrelated couple on a Roma settlement.</description>

      <body>Greek police are trying to discover the identity of a young blonde girl who was found living on a Roma settlement with a family she did not resemble. DNA tests revealed the child, called Maria and aged about four, was not related to the couple she lived with. The little girl is now being looked after by a charity. Her photo has been released to help find her family. Officials believe she may have been a victim of abduction or child trafficking. Police are appealing internationally as the girl looks like she might be from northern or eastern Europe. The charity, Smile of the Child, told the BBC that the girl was frightened and neglected when she arrived in their care but that in overall good health and was now more relaxed. It said it had received many calls since the appeal was launched. A spokesman for the British couple Kate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case gave them "great hope" that she would one day be found alive. Police raided the Roma camp, near Farsala in central Greece, to search for drugs and weapons. They noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde-haired, green-eyed, pale-skinned little girl and her parents, and found further discrepancies when they investigated the family's documents. The couple had registered different numbers of children with different regional family registries. The woman claimed to have given birth to six children within a 10-month period. When questioned about how they came to have Maria, the couple gave "constantly changing claims," Thessalia Province Police Director Vassilis Halatsis said. "The girl might have been abducted from a hospital, or given up by an unmarried mother," the officer said. "So far we do not have a declared disappearance of a child of this age in Greece. Through Interpol, we will request assistance from the other European countries." The 39-year-old man and his 40-year-old wife have been arrested on suspicion of abducting a minor. The president of Smile of the Child, Kostas Yaaopoulos, said the girl was being used to beg on the streets. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 35 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the huge bush fires burning in the state of New South Wales. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. It was the same day that a massive bush fire - which is still burning - began. About 200 homes have been destroyed in dozens of fires which have been burning for several days. The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says this year's fires have come unusually early after unseasonably hot weather, and many are fearing a long and dangerous summer. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. The Australian Defence Force issued a statement about the fire burning between Lithgow and Bilpin, some 80 km (50 miles) north-west of Sydney, which is reported to have burned through 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) and destroyed properties. It said it was investigating the circumstances of the fire, which began on defence land. "The fire started on 16 October, the same day that defence personnel were conducting an explosive ordnance training activity," the statement said. "Defence is investigating if the two events are linked. "Our thoughts are with those who have lost property or whose property is threatened by these devastating fires." Firefighters have been trying to make the most of a relatively cool day to tackle about 20 fires that are burning out of control, but higher temperatures and strong winds are expected to create difficult conditions in the coming days. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said Saturday's conditions were a "pause", but that the fire perimeter stretched for more than 500km. "We're by no means out of the woods," he told broadcaster ABC. "It's just calmed down a little bit and obviously we're bracing ourselves for these worsening conditions." Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said some of the fires were so large they would take some time to completely extinguish. "Firefighters will be working on these fires for weeks," he said. "It's all about reducing the risk of these fires to breach containment lines and run under hotter, drier, windier condition over coming days." Smoke and ash from the wildfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Police prevent Maldives election</title>
      <description>The Maldives is plunged into fresh political uncertainty as a re-run presidential election, set for Saturday, is cancelled at the last moment.</description>

      <body>Police in the Maldives have stopped a presidential election from going ahead on Saturday, plunging the country into fresh political uncertainty. Electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The latest move has caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process". A US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the failure to hold Saturday's election "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. In a televised speech, Mr Thowfeek said it was a "dark day for democracy". Correspondents said the Maldives' capital, Male, appeared calm early on Saturday, with people still waking up to the news. Mr Nasheed is standing in the election but the two candidates who trailed behind him in an earlier vote - held last month but then annulled - have been fighting for it not to take place. Late on Friday, Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they hadn't had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court didn't issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. Last week, the Maldives Supreme Court annulled the result of the first round of the elections held in September because of alleged irregularities. Mr Nasheed, now the main opposition leader in the Indian Ocean archipelago, won 45% in that poll against 5% for current President Mohamed Waheed. Mr Waheed has since withdrawn from the election. Analysts say that if his replacement is not elected by the end of his official term in three weeks, it will spark a constitutional crisis. Early on Saturday, Mr Thowfeek had announced: "We will hold the election in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. "The start of the voting may be delayed in some places, but we will allow more time for people to cast their ballots." However, within hours police were at the electoral commission and Mr Thowfeek was obliged to call the election off. "Police personnel in this building stopped us taking anything from here [election offices], so we have no other option except to stop the election today," he said. "A new date for elections will be informed later," he added. International observers had all praised the conduct of the first-round election, and the Supreme Court's decision to annul it was condemned by Mr Nasheed's supporters. Mr Nasheed came to power in 2008 in the Maldives' first free elections, but resigned amid violent protests and a mutiny by senior police officers in February 2012. </body>

      <body>American jazz star Patti Austin has cancelled a concert in Beijing after suffering "a severe asthma attack". A statement on the singer's website said Ms Austin was unable to perform at Forbidden City Concert Hall on Friday night "due to health problems". While the cause of her illness has not been confirmed, it comes at a time of growing concern over air pollution levels in the Chinese capital. The city has recently announced measures to combat worsening pollution. They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution. The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next. A statement on Patti Austin's website said: "She was taken in an emergency to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital this morning where she has been treated for a severe asthma attack in combination with respiratory infection. "Ms Austin is currently resting in her hotel. Her current breathing condition does not physically enable her to perform tonight. "Ms Austin is extremely disappointed about this situation since she was very much looking forward to performing." The new anti-pollution system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red. On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites. Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecues will be ordered to close temporarily, and fireworks will be banned throughout the city. When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed. The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial. Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force. Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates. </body>

      <body>Criminal charges are being considered against a US scout leader who toppled an ancient rock formation in Utah, sparking an international outcry. Glenn Taylor was filmed by a colleague pushing the 170 million-year-old red rock in Goblin Valley State Park and celebrating afterwards. The two scouts say they have received death threats after the video was posted online. The two men argue the rock was loose and could have fallen on a passer-by. Utah State Parks spokesman Eugene Swalberg said the state authorities were considering bringing the charges after the incident. "This is not behaviour that is appreciated or should exist in state parks," he told the Deseret News. "This has been formed for literally millions of years, and it's supposed to last for a long time. It doesn't need individuals doing the work of Mother Nature." The Boy Scouts of America - who have millions of members across the country - also condemned the action, warning that it would take "appropriate" measures. The scout leaders said the stone was pushed over because of safety concerns. However, scout leader Dave Hall told the Salt Lake Tribune: "I think we made the right decision, but probably the wrong method. "We take full responsibility for whatever mistake we made, and we're open to whatever that means from the state, from the Boy Scouts' office, etc." In the video, Mr Taylor is seen congratulating a colleague after the mushroom-shaped sandstone rock - known as a "goblin" - was toppled. </body>

      <description>Hoffenheim launch a protest after Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling heads the ball through a hole in the net.</description>

      <body>Hoffenheim are set to protest against a freak goal awarded to Bayer Leverkusen when Stefan Kiessling headed the ball through a hole in the side of the net. Referee Felix Brych failed to spot that Kiessling's header flew wide of the post in the 70th minute of Leverkusen's 2-1 Bundesliga win on Friday. Hoffenheim managing director Alexander Rosen said: "It's a scandal. "That was no goal, there are no two ways about it. We are definitely going to protest." Brych, a Fifa referee, said that no player had indicated it was not a goal. "I had a slight doubt but the reaction from the players was clear - nobody was against [the decision]," Brych said. "I checked with Kiessling. But no-one, not even him, said that it wasn't a goal. The ball was in the net and for everyone on the pitch it was a legitimate goal." Meanwhile, goalscorer Kiessling has apologised saying he could "fully understand the reactions" to the goal on his Facebook page.   "After seeing the replays on television, I can clearly see that it was not a legitimate goal," he said. "During the game, after heading the ball and turning my head, I did not exactly see whether the ball had gone into the goal or not. Somehow, the ball was lying in the goal and I said exactly that to the referee. "I'm sorry for all sports fans. Naturally, it's not nice to win like that. Fairness is important in sport, for us in the club and for me personally." In April 1994, Bayern Munich beat Nuremburg 2-1 after defender Thomas Helmer was awarded a goal despite the ball not going in. Nuremburg lodged a complaint, and Germany's Football Association ordered a replay, which Bayern won 5-0 on their way to clinching the title. Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol said: "It's definitely bitter for us and something like this has already happened once, and that game was replayed so I think we're going to see this game again. "Anything else would be a joke. You can't replay a Bayern Munich game, but not a Hoffenheim game." Several Hoffenheim substitutes raced behind the goal to examine the netting and appeared to try to point out Brych's error. But the referee was by then powerless to overrule his original decision. Rudi Voller, Leverkusen's sporting director, said: "That's not how we wanted to win the game. The fair result would have been a 2-2." Leverkusen were leading through Sidney Sam's 26th-minute opener when the controversy happened. Germany international Kiessling headed a corner wide of the near post, and could be seen turning away in frustration before Brych awarded the goal. The referee then awarded Hoffenheim a generous penalty when Roberto Firmino was fouled a foot outside the penalty area. But Firmino's spot-kick was saved. Sven Schipplock pulled a goal back for Hoffenheim two minutes from the end, but they could not save a point and fell to their first home defeat of the season. Brych, who refereed England's 3-2 friendly win over Scotland at Wembley in August, sent off Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic during a 2-0 Champions League defeat away to Romanian side Otelul Galati in October 2011. The win took Sami Hyypia's side top, although Bayern Munich can overtake them by beating Mainz on Saturday. </body>

      <title>Escaped US killers sign on as felons</title>
      <description>Two convicted murderers freed from prison thanks to forged paperwork went to a jail to register as felons days after their release, records show.</description>

      <body>Two convicted murderers freed from prison with forged paperwork dutifully went to a jail to register as felons several days after their release. Florida officials are searching for Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, who were serving life sentences. Prison officials said they will tighten up their early-release policy to ensure there is no repeat of the blunder. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after first convict's release. It is not clear who made the bogus release documents, or if the escapes were related. Jenkins walked free on 27 September and registered three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker was set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The two prisoners apparently signed on to keep up the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. A deputy at the jail verifies that felons do not have any outstanding warrants, according to jail spokesman Allen Moore. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge were processed through standard channels this autumn, officials have said. Authorities received release orders bearing the faked signature of Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry, printed on Ninth Judicial Circuit letterhead. The fabricated documents were processed by the Orange County clerk's office and sent to the Department of Corrections, which co-ordinated the inmates' release from Franklin prison in the city of Carrabelle, in the north of the state. Sheriff's office spokesman Angelo Nieves told reporters: "This shouldn't have happened, but it did, and our concern is to get these individuals into custody." Judge Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department, notably, how rare it is for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons will now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates had been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 shooting death of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting death of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <title>Fire burns tonnes of sugar in Brazil</title>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <body>The Venezuelan government has denied reports that rescue teams have have retrieved the remains of Italian fashion heir Vittorio Missoni and four other people from the Caribbean. They were in a small plane carrying six people that plunged into the sea shortly after taking off from the Los Roques islands in January. The wreckage was found in June at a depth of 70m (230ft). Rescue teams have been carrying out searches in the area for several days. Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega issued a statement saying that she was going to meet relatives arriving in Caracas to update them on the rescue mission. El Universal newspaper, Italian media and news agencies reported on Thursday that the bodies of the four passengers and the co-pilot, Juan Carlos Ferrer, had been found. They are still looking for the remains of the Venezuelan pilot, German Marchant, according to those reports. But El Universal has now said that rescue teams working north of Los Roques have not yet retrieved the bodies. Mr Missoni and his wife, Maurizia Castiglioni died in the crash alongside two Italian friends who were holidaying with them in the Venezuelan archipelago, Guido Foresti and Elda Scalvenzi. The twin-engine aircraft disappeared on 4 January. Mr Missoni was the son of the late founder of the Italian Missoni fashion house, Ottavio Missoni, and co-owned the firm with his siblings. A piece of luggage from the aircraft was found off the Dutch island of Curacao, about 320km (200 miles) west of Los Roques, later that month. Los Roques, an archipelago made up of dozens of islands some 95 miles (150km) off Venezuela's coast, is one of the area's most popular holiday destinations. </body>

      <body>President Alpha Conde's ruling party in Guinea took just under half of the seats in last month's parliamentary poll, electoral officials have said. They said the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) secured 53 seats in the 114-member parliament. The main opposition party had 37 seats, while the rest went to smaller parties. The opposition said it would not recognise the result of the poll, which international observers said was marred by "irregularities". Opposition spokesman Sydia Toure said the announced result of the 28 September election did not reflect "the people's vote". Earlier, the observers said that "breaches and irregularities were observed in a certain number of constituencies, preventing a significant number of votes from being taken into account". The monitors included representatives from the UN, EU, West African block Ecowas and US and French diplomats. The election in the west African nation is intended to replace a transitional parliament that has run the nation since military rule ended in 2010. The run-up to the election was hit by violence, as well as ethnic and religious tension. It has been much delayed and was supposed to be held six months after the 2010 presidential elections, which Mr Conde narrowly won. </body>

      <body>The Malian authorities say 72 people are now known to have died when a boat capsized a week ago on the River Niger. Rescuers found the bodies of dozens more passengers after the boat was refloated, Mali's Security Minister Sada Samake said. He said 210 people survived the accident, in which the vessel broke up near Konna whilst en route north from the town of Mopti to Timbuktu. Eyewitnesses had said the boat was overloaded with cargo. "The rescue teams have been able to bring it to the surface," General Samake announced in a press conference reported by the French news agency, AFP. He said 72 had died, and there were 210 survivors, of whom 11 were lightly injured. Officials had previously said 39 people died in the accident. He thanked the French military for its help in providing a medical team after the accident. The boat broke at the stern on a branch of the river near the village of Koubi. Speaking at the same press conference, Mali's Planning Minister, Abdoulaye Koumare, said the government was introducing new safety measures to prevent a repeat of such a tragedy. "In the future, these canoes will have to be equipped with life vests, fire extinguishers and lights for night-time navigation," he said. An investigation into why the large dugout capsized is still under way. Eyewitnesses had said the boat collapsed because it was overloaded with cargo. Local residents said many of the passengers would have been schoolchildren returning to the north for the start of their new academic year. Many Malians opt to travel by water, often in rudimentary canoes, due to poor road conditions in the north and the relatively high cost of overland travel. Over 4,000km (2,500 miles) long, the River Niger connects landlocked Mali's arid north with the more fertile south. </body>

      <body>The mayor of China's eastern city of Nanjing has been sacked, state media say, amid a crackdown on corruption. Ji Jianye was dismissed from his leadership positions for "suspected serious disciplinary violations", Xinhua news agency said. It comes two days after the ruling party's corruption watchdog revealed Mr Ji was under investigation. The anti-corruption drive was launched by Chinese President Xi Jinping after he took office in November last year. He warned that public anger over corruption threatened the survival of the Communist Party, and promised to pursue "tigers" - top-level officials - as well as "flies". Correspondents say Mr Ji appears to be one of the most senior targets of the campaign to date. No details of the case have been revealed, however, state-backed newspaper the 21st Century Business Herald said Mr Ji was investigated over economic corruption and construction projects. A report on Communist Party mouthpiece People's Daily said Mr Ji's case could involve about 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) in funds. Several high-profile officials have been dismissed in recent months, including the former railways minister and a top economic planner. A number of senior PetroChina executives are also under investigation. Nanjing, the capital of Jiangsu province, is home to about seven million people. Mr Ji has been mayor of Nanjing since January 2010 and was also the city's deputy party secretary, Xinhua said. </body>

      <body>The International Cricket Council has handed Bangladesh an extension until 30 November to complete work on stadiums for next year's ICC World Twenty20. It had been widely reported  that concerns over facilities might cause the tournament to be moved to another country, such as South Africa. But the ICC board has now approved a request to extend the deadline. The full schedule for the event, due to take place between 16 March and 6 April 2014, will be released on 27 October. The news follows an inspection report by the ICC's venue consultant. The World Twenty20 will feature men's and women's tournaments played in parallel, as has happened at three of the four previous events, and both are set to be the biggest yet - with 16 men's teams rather than 12, and 10 women's teams rather than eight. The two-day ICC board meeting in London also discussed banned Pakistan pace bowler Mohammad Amir's plea to resume his career in domestic cricket - opting to review the matter in due course once its revised anti-corruption code has been adopted. Amir, 21, was jailed for six months and banned from cricket for five years for his part in a spot-fixing betting scam in England in 2010. The board also approved the schedule of next year's Under-19 World Cup, to be held in the United Arab Emirates in February and March; approved a recommendation to increase assistance given to Afghanistan by $1.1m (£680,461); and agreed that an ICC chairman will be appointed after next year's annual conference. </body>

      <title>Spain party treasurer 'sent cash'</title>

      <body>The former treasurer of Spain's ruling Popular Party says he handed thousands of euros in slush fund payments to the party's secretary general. Speaking by video link from jail, Luis Barcenas said he had given two envelopes with 7,500 euros (£6,350; $10,300) to Maria Cospedal in 2008. Ms Cospedal - who is suing Mr Barcenas for defamation - denied the claim. Mr Barcenas is in custody pending trial over corruption claims. The scandal has rocked the party and angered Spaniards. The former treasurer was giving evidence to a court in Toledo on Friday. He claimed he had personally delivered the cash to Ms Cospedal. Mr Barcenas added that the slush fund payments were a PP tradition. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier this year denied the claim. He also said allegations that he had personally received illegal payments were "lies and manipulations". The Barcenas affair sparked widespread anger in Spain, hit by a double-dip recession and high unemployment. In July, clashes erupted between anti-government protesters and police after more than 1,000 people gathered outside the PP headquarters in Madrid, calling on the government to resign. The scandal originated in a 2009 judicial investigation into corrupt payments involving PP members. In January this year, El Pais newspaper published an list it said showed illegal payments to party members that had been signed off by Mr Barcenas. The former party treasurer says he made numerous bonus cash payments to Mr Rajoy and other senior party members out of the slush fund of donations by businesses. In response, they have accused the ex-treasurer of trying to blackmail them. The PP was handed a clear mandate by Spanish voters at the end of 2011 and as a result Mr Rajoy and his party enjoy a clear majority in parliament. The corruption allegations coincide with Spain's worst economic crisis for decades, and have threatened to destabilise government attempts to shore up public finances and bring the recession to an end. </body>

      <body>The US has agreed a deal with Romania to use an air base there as a transit point for American forces leaving Afghanistan, officials have said. The agreement was reached at bilateral talks at the Pentagon. The move will allow the US to switch its flight operations to Romania from Kyrgyzstan's Manas air base, when the US lease there expires in July 2014. Washington plans to withdraw most of its 52,000 troops from Afghanistan by the end of 2014. The US wants to keep a smaller force in the country after the deadline, but is still negotiating key details with the government in Kabul. The deal about the use of Romania's Mihail Kogalniceanu air base was agreed during the talks between US Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel and Romanian Defence Minister Mircea Dusa. In a statement, Pentagon spokesman George Little said Mr Hagel "praised this agreement, which is particularly important as the US prepares to wind down transit centre operations at Manas". "Secretary Hagel highlighted this agreement as a further testament to Romania's steadfast commitment to the Isaf (International Security Assistance Force) mission and its commitment to regional and international security." However, the details of the deal were not released. The base is near the Black Sea town of Constanta. In June, Kyrgyzstan's parliament voted to end the US lease on Manas in July 2014. The US pays $60m (£39m) each year to lease the base, which has been in operation since 2001. Russia also has an air base in Kyrgyzstan, for which it agreed a 15-year extension last year. </body>

      <body>Nine Lebanese Shia pilgrims held hostage in Syria have been freed, Lebanon's interior minster has said. The pilgrims have crossed over into southern Turkey, and will arrive back in Lebanon soon, according to Interior Minister Marwan Charbel. The nine were part of a group of 11 who were seized while making their way back to Lebanon in May 2012 after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of the group were subsequently released. The pilgrims' release had been reported by Lebanese officials three days after they were seized, but it then transpired that they had not left Syria. "The story is over," Mr Charbel told the Reuters news agency. "In the next 24 hours, they will be with us [in Lebanon]." The Qatari foreign minister told the al-Jazeera television network on Friday that the pilgrims' release had now come about due to Qatari mediation. The news was greeted with jubilation in southern Beirut, where relatives of some of those kidnapped live, according to local media reports. In August a group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it was behind the kidnapping of two Turkish pilots in Beirut, saying they would be freed in exchange for the pilgrims. Mr Charbel said he now expected the two pilots, Murat Akpinar and co-pilot Murat Agca, to be released soon, according to Reuters. "We insist that those who kidnapped the Turks release them,'" he said, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was also quoted as saying he expected a resolution to their case soon. "Very positive developments are under way in the case of the pilots; this matter has largely been settled," Mr Davutoglu said on Turkish television, according to AFP. Earlier this week the two appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. There are also expectations that a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government might be released as part of an elaborate three-way deal. </body>

      <body>At least 16 Syrian soldiers have been killed in a suicide bombing and fighting that followed in a Damascus suburb, activists say. The blast triggered clashes at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Earlier, the US urged the Syrian government to allow aid to reach starving civilians in Damascus. Washington said the army's months-long siege left many people in rebel-held areas in desperate need of food, water and medicine. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which relies on a network of activists inside Syria, said the suicide car bombing by the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front triggered heavy fighting at a key checkpoint between Jaramana and the rebel-held town of Mleha. It said rebels fired rockets into Jaramana during the fighting and Syrian fighter jets retaliated by striking nearby opposition-held areas. The report could not be confirmed. The BBC's Jim Muir in neighbouring Lebanon says the use of suicide bombers to open an offensive is a tactic that has been used increasingly by the rebels in recent months. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In August a car bomb in the suburb killed 18 people. Syria's embattled President Assad has drawn support from Syria's ethnic and religious minorities, including Christians and members of his Alawite sect, an offshoot of Shia Islam. The rebel movement is dominated by Sunni Muslims, who are a majority in Syria. In another development, British surgeon David Nott, who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks, has told the BBC he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. "There was definitely a game going on between the snipers," he said. "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." He added: "They were definitely targeted in the uterus. The majority of the babies didn't make it." Mr Nott said he wanted the UK government to help open up a humanitarian corridor in Syria to allow aid and aid workers to enter the country safely. In a statement on Friday, US State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki called on the Syrian government "to immediately approve relief convoys". She warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". At least three of Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk, Eastern Ghouta and Moudamiyah - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year. It began with popular protests against President Assad before degenerating into civil war. </body>

      <title>Salmond: 'Scotland's time is now'</title>
      <description>SNP leader Alex Salmond tells his party conference it is "time for independence" and that the case for voting yes will be made on 26 November.</description>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24576773</url>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <body>Manchester United manager David Moyes endured another afternoon of frustration as Southampton snatched a last-gasp equaliser to stun Old Trafford. Captain Adam Lallana tapped in from a yard out with only a minute of normal time remaining to give the visitors a share of the spoils and leave United eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. The champions had looked on course for what would have been a ninth successive win over the Saints. Teenager Adnan Januzaj produced another moment of brilliance to set Robin van Persie on his way to put United in front midway through the first half. The hosts might have put the game beyond Southampton as both Van Persie and the excellent Wayne Rooney hit the crossbar. However Mauricio Pochettino's side will feel their dominance of possession more than warranted a point, even if they lacked a genuine cutting edge for long periods. For United, there had been signs that they were beginning to turn the corner after the club's worst start to a Premier League season. The movement and understanding between Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj bordered on the telepathic. Even as Moyes's side were forced back for long periods of this game, the trio ensured this was a United side that bristled with attacking menace for all 90 minutes. Januzaj, 18, who signed a five-year contract before the game, once again displayed signs of his immense talent with a verve and energy that glowed throughout. His battle with Nathaniel Clyne was a feature of the first-half as Southampton plotted their passing angles with patience and precision, forcing United onto the back foot. Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama pulled the strings in midfield, while the dynamism of Lallana meant Saints always had options, even if chances on goal were scarce. Jay Rodriguez headed over and Dani Osvaldo might have done better with only David De Gea to beat and, as Southampton bordered on the profligate, United were far more ruthless. Van Persie had twice gone close in the opening 20 minutes, before Rooney's sublime pass set him in on goal once more, only for an offside flag to deny him the chance to finish. However, the brilliance of Januzaj ensured United would not be denied for long. Picking the ball up in his own half, Januzaj threaded a 40-yard pass into the path of Rooney to slice Southampton open in the blink of an eye. Rooney's shot was brilliantly blocked by goalkeeper Artur Boruc, but Van Persie was quickly onto the rebound, rolling the ball beyond the despairing dive of Dejan Lovren to give United the lead. It was the first goal Southampton had conceded in almost seven hours of Premier League football but it came from a familiar source - this was Van Persie's fifth goal in as many appearances against Saints but his first for five Premier League matches. For a five-minute spell, Saints looked lost. Rooney rattled the crossbar with a thunderous shot but the visitors weathered the United storm and came again - Van Persie heading Lovren's header off his own line just after half-time. And yet, United always carried the greater threat. Their movement in attack constantly confounded Southampton's defenders, with Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj swapping places and eluding markers at will. The Dutchman might have a second goal as he headed onto the crossbar on the hour. Moments later, Januzaj was in the thick of the action once more, unleashing a dipping, swerving left-foot drive that Boruc somehow clawed away. Though Southampton refused to lie down - Lallana testing De Ge with a low shot - hope appeared to be draining away. However, when Lovren forced Shaw's corner towards goal, Lallana got the faintest of touches to beat De Gea to earn Saints a point and extend United's poor league run to only two wins in seven matches. </body>

      <body>Chelsea fought back from a goal down to thump Cardiff after scoring an equaliser which should not have stood. Jordon Mutch ran through to put Cardiff ahead after David Luiz's mistake. But Eden Hazard levelled after Samuel Eto'o kicked the ball away as Bluebirds keeper David Marshall bounced it, which according to Fifa's rules is a foul. A well-worked Eto'o goal put Chelsea ahead and, after their boss Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands, Oscar and Hazard sealed the victory. Chelsea climb to second in the table but the scoreline was harsh on Cardiff - starting with the home side's equaliser in the 32nd minute. The laws of the game stipulate that the ball is considered under the goalkeeper's control when he bounces it, but referee Anthony Taylor allowed play to continue before Hazard fired home. Cardiff had taken the lead with a bizarre goal of their own. Luiz casually let the ball run past him after Ramires played it back to Cech, allowing Mutch to nip in and coolly slot home. The Welsh side were showing no ill-effects of a turbulent two-week period that saw the future of boss Malky Mackay put in doubt when his head of recruitment, Iain Moody, was replaced by unknown 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov. Mackay has insisted he has no intention to quit, despite reports that Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan is also suggesting substitutions and tactics during games. Tan was not at Stamford Bridge and Mackay's tactics proved effective as his side soaked up Chelsea's attacks despite conceding the majority of possession, and frequently threatened on the break. John Terry twice went close to levelling with headers but it took a superb save from Petr Cech to stop Peter Odemwingie extending Cardiff's lead with a header from Peter Whittingham's free-kick. Chelsea's frustrations continued after their controversial equaliser, at least until Eto'o scored his first Premier League goal after 66 minutes by latching on to a Hazard pass and burying the ball past Marshall. The Bluebirds responded well and almost hit back when Kim Bo-Kyung stung Cech's palms. Mourinho had to watch what looked like being an anxious final 20 minutes from the stands, with Taylor ordering him from his technical area after he persistently complained to fourth official Trevor Kettle about the referee's decisions. But Oscar's fine strike from the edge of the box gave his side breathing space in the 78th minute and Hazard made it four soon after, dancing into the box before beating Marshall at his near post. </body>

      <body>Friends have paid tribute to Felix Dexter, who died on Friday. The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52. Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy". He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away. "I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip." Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known." Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard. "This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs." He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out." Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers. He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career. Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and the Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater. </body>

      <title>Philomena 'to fight R rating' in US</title>

      <body>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give his studio's latest film an R rating, according to reports. Philomena received the rating from the Classification and Ratings Administration for two instances of bad language. But the Weinstein Company will now officially appeal against the rating, The Hollywood Reporter said. The British Stephen Frears drama stars Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. The film is based on the 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith about Irish-Catholic woman Philomena Lee's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption decades earlier. The Weinstein Company plans to release the film in the US over the Thanksgiving period next month, however it has argued the R rating will affect the number of moviegoers who could potentially watch it. The restricted R rating means people under the age of 17 may only see the film if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the UK, it has been given a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification, where children younger than 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Weinstein's studio previously became embroiled in a row with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2012 over the documentary Bully over the use of bad language in the film. It opened in Los Angeles and New York without a rating, after the Weinstein Company chose to ignore the MPAA's original R rating. The studio eventually agreed to remove the language and an edited version of the film received a PG-13 rating. </body>

      <title>Tennant's Richard II rules at RSC</title>
      <description>Early reviews note David Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair in Richard II in Stratford-upon-Avon.</description>

      <body>David Tennant's latest role sees him transformed into a king with flowing locks in the Royal Shakespeare Company's (RSC) Richard II. Early reviews have noted Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair. Richard II is the former Doctor Who star's first RSC role since his acclaimed Hamlet five years ago. Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <title>Brazil confident of Libra oil field success</title>
      <description>How Brazil hopes to reap large rewards from its oil fields</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24583432</url>
      <date>1382140841</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70571000/jpg/_70571630_70562660.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>"Pre-Salt". A term that hardly anyone outside oil industry would have ever heard of and, even if they had, it holds few clues as to what it really is. But those two incongruous, single-syllable words hold the key to Brazil's hopes of becoming a major oil producer, securing billions of dollars in revenue and helping to boost a faltering economy. Not far off the coast of Rio de Janeiro State, and just to the north east of the famous coastal city is the area in question. It is an almost unimaginably large oil deposit; 1,500 sq km (579 sq miles) and 326m (1,070ft) deep. Although it lies well beneath the sea bed, under a thick layer of rock and salt, the find is said to be relatively risk-free. Estimates vary but it could hold as many as 12bn barrels of oil. The find has been called "Libra" and Brazil is about to auction off the rights to develop the site, with some pretty tight strings attached. Magda Chambriard is the Director General of Brazil's National Oil Agency. For her it's a win-win situation. We discussed Libra and its implications for Brazil as a global oil producer, in her Rio de Janeiro headquarters. She dismissed, with a wry smile, suggestions the country didn't have the experience or infrastructure to cope with such a huge undertaking as the development of the Libra field. "Everything is very well planned. There are new platforms, new pipelines, more infrastructure," said the woman who trained as an oil engineer but is now one of the most powerful figures in the industry. "Everything here in Brazil is happening in the correct way so we are very confident that everything will be OK." Just to the north of Rio de Janeiro, the once small fishing village of Macae is the closest land point to the offshore fields. It's not quite El Dorado but property prices here are already among the highest in the country and these days the noise of helicopters ferrying workers out to the existing rigs is much louder than the chug of fishing boats around the mangroves. Realising the urgent need for able workers if Brazil is to make the most of its impending oil boom, the local authority here is training hundreds of people to work on the rigs. Many are migrant workers from other parts of Brazil, like 32 year-old Claudia, who is learning to be a skilled welder. "Where I'm from, up in Bahia, sadly there's no work - it's all down here," Claudia tells me. "The training lasts three to four months and I'm now in the final stages. But it's free and I'm actually working in the company where I expect to get a job." According to Claudia at least half of the people in her own north-eastern village have made the long journey south, hoping for a well-paid job, like hers, in the oil sector. When the bidding process for the Libra auction was announced, there was considerable surprise that several major oil producers, including BP, the BG Group, Exxon and Chevron, decided not to enter. All are involved quite heavily in other parts of Brazil's diverse energy sector but many analysts say the high proportion of profits being demanded by the Brazilian government and strict conditions of the lease had persuaded some companies to turn their backs on Libra. Brazil has made it clear it expects to keep somewhere in the region of 70% of the profits from the Libra field. Whoever wins the bidding will certainly be looking at long, not short-term returns as developing the find will require at least $200bn (£123bn). Oh, and there's a one-off, up-front bonus payment of $5bn to the Brazilian government in return for winning the auction as well. Nonetheless, there are hundreds of small and medium foreign firms doing very well on the back of Brazil's oil boom. Companies like the British-owned Swire Group, which has plenty of offshore experience in other deep-water environments, specialises in providing containers and cabling for the industry. Swire now employs about 50 people at its plant in Macae. They will soon be moving to new, bigger premises on the other side of town and hope to increase their workforce four-fold in the next five years. "You have to approach this from a Brazilian perspective," says Marcelo Nacif, Swire's local general manager. "You have to have local people who understand the culture and the bureaucracy and you have to adapt." The bottom line, says Mr Nacif, is that specialist companies like his have to go where the oil is and, for now, that's Brazil. "The North Sea is on the down side, right?" he asks rhetorically. "Every day there's less oil, less gas there so if those companies don't look at South America and Africa in the future their business is going to shrink." There is still a highly protectionist and barrier-driven nature to doing business in Brazil and some here object to the involvement of foreign businesses, in any way whatsoever, in the Libra bidding process. Workers from Brazil's state-run oil company, Petrobras, have just gone out on strike over the issue and their demand for bigger salaries. But, say many analysts, their arguments are difficult to comprehend. Brazil just doesn't have the capacity or ability to develop Libra on its own, certainly not to its full potential. Furthermore, under the straight-jacket Brazil is forcing the winning bidder to wear, is a stipulation that Petrobras must share 30% of the new venture and be allowed to operate all of the rigs in the new field. Oil has always proved to be a blessing and a curse. On the impoverished fringes of Macae, only 10% of the residents have basic sewage facilities, crime is rampant but some improvements are finally being made to people's lives by the local authority. President Dilma Rousseff has promised to divert all of Brazil's petroleum revenues back into social services and public works but what Brazil does with the windfall from the Libra auction will be watched very closely here. </body>

      <title>Managing the worst team in the world</title>
      <description>Meet the manager of the world's worst football team</description>

      <body>Waking up on an island of crystal blue lakes, turquoise seas and tropical temperatures each morning sounds like paradise. But rather than relaxing in a hammock all day in his adopted home of the Turks and Caicos Islands, 41-year-old Englishman Matthew Green is busy trying to rid the country of the title 'world's worst football team'. It's a distinction they share with Bhutan and San Marino at joint 207th place in the Fifa world football rankings. The task isn't easy, as Green's team last won in 2008 (against St Lucia) and haven't actually played a match for two years because of a shortage of players. His squad includes a variety of occupations, including a policeman, lawyer, teacher and construction worker. Add the fact that his only other managerial experience is with a pub team in Hull and you get an idea of how tough his job is. "Everybody thinks you are sat on the beach drinking pina coladas," Green says. "I wish I was, but there is too much to do. "I did once take a pub side in Hull, called Spiders, to a Sunday League title. But that was a bit different to running an international team. "Every time I go back to Hull, my brother and friends make fun of the fact we are ranked so low. I know they are only joking but there is pride there. You want to see your country rise up the rankings. "We are certainly capable of doing so, if we can get some extra resources." The Turks and Caicos Islands is a British territory made up of 40 Caribbean islands - eight are inhabited - covering an area of 166 square miles. The overall population is about 30,000, one third of whom are under 15. As technical director of their football association, Green is responsible for overseeing all aspects of football development, from working with the men's and women's national teams to the youth set-up, coaching and refereeing. The island's league has six amateur teams, yet most of the players are expats meaning Green has a pool of fewer than 25 players to choose from. There are some talented youngsters, but they tend to be on scholarships in America and the UK, making it difficult to return for matches or training camps. One of the few professionals available is Gavin Glinton, 34, who plays for Vietnamese second division club Mikado Nam Dinhis. He is the country's all-time top goalscorer, with four goals in eight international matches. "The players are great to deal with, for the most part," says Green, one of three full-time football employees. The island's FA was formed in 1996 and became affiliated to Fifa two years later. Back then they had no pitches, no leagues, and had to wait until 2006 for their first win - against the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean Cup. So how did a former teacher from Hull become their manager? Green was released by Hull City at the age of 15 for being too small and went on to qualify as a teacher. He arrived in the Bahamas in 1998 trying to find a job at a school. The search was fruitful and he turned Temple Christian High School into one of the major powerhouses of Bahamian football, with the senior high girls team winning the national championship every year from 2001 to 2007. At the same time he also started to work his way up the national coaching ladder. He was also an active player, finishing top scorer for Grasshoppers FC in 2000 and 2001. In 2007, he spotted an advert for technical director of the Turks and Caicos Islands FA and decided to give it a go. He landed the job and discovered an island of beautiful beaches and average summer temperatures of 29C. It's little surprise that celebrities such as Hollywood actor Bruce Willis and England defender Rio Ferdinand have splashed out on properties there in recent years. Green lives on his own in a two-bedroom house surrounded by natural vegetation, overlooking lakes and hills. A balcony provides picture-perfect views. After 15 years in the Caribbean he feels at home, although traces of his heritage are revealed from time to time. "My accent varies depending on who I am talking to," he says. "I have a 'coaching voice' which is a bit of a 'put on', but it makes sure all our players can understand me. "My Hull accent comes out when I get angry or excited - which is quite often!" The islands haven't played since their 10-0 aggregate defeat to the Bahamas in a World Cup qualifier in 2011. Green is determined to hold a couple of friendlies in the coming months, ahead of their 2018 World Cup qualifying campaign in the Concacaf group. And he's sure there are reasons for optimism. "Within a few years we have managed to put together a pretty strong youth programme and our grassroots programme is pretty big," he says. "We now have over 20 leagues and competitions across all ages and sexes. A few years ago we had three. "It has not been easy, but it has become the most popular sport in the country at youth level. Track and field, softball and basketball are still very popular but, in terms of numbers, football is well ahead now. "A new 5,000-capacity stadium was built the other year thanks to Fifa funding, while we now have more than 500 youngsters registered to our youth programmes compared to less than 100 when I first started." Maybe he can even get the islands off the dreaded bottom spot in the rankings, which really would be reason for celebration. </body>

      <title>How to rebuild the Republican brand</title>
      <description>Get an Angela Merkel, and other advice for US Republicans</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70575000/jpg/_70575498_bushflag.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The Republican Party drew its lowest approval ratings in history during the US government shutdown and debt ceiling impasse. Political strategists offer five recommendations for how to rebuild the party's brand. Republican strategist Ford O'Connell notes the party cites popular two-term US President Ronald Reagan, in office 1981-89, on an array of issues. But more than two decades after Reagan left office, the late president is not doing the party any favours, he says. "Ronald Reagan is dead and they need to accept it," says O'Connell. O'Connell suggests that instead of inspiring positive associations in voters' minds, invoking Reagan actually "prevents modern Republicans from articulating a 21st Century agenda". Republican strategist Tom Rath says Reagan, an "icon" of the party, would not be the same figure today as when he was president in the 1980s. "His presidency was a presidency for the times, and times change," he says. "Ronald Reagan didn't have to deal with Twitter or the internet; things are different now." "To say we have to do exactly what Reagan did, that belies the inevitable change in the character of the American people and the issues that are on the table." And Republican strategist John Feehery says, "He was conservative, but he's not nearly as conservative as these guys [in Congress] now." "We need someone who can be tough but also exhibit common sense and be practical," says Feehery, who cites the current chancellor of Germany. Feehery says the Republican Party lacks a strong cadre of women, and one woman in particular who can assume a senior role in the current "patriarchal" congressional leadership. Republicans need a "Sarah Palin with brains," jokes Feehery of the former Republican vice-presidential candidate, who later resigned as governor of Alaska for a career as a professional conservative figurehead and speechmaker. The Republican strategist says women in Congress helped soothe tensions behind the scenes during the 16-day government shutdown and debt limit deadlock. Republican Senator Susan Collins in particular has been recognised for her role in facilitating successful negotiations between Senate leaders of both parties. "If there is anything to be heartened by over the last few weeks, it is the emergence of Susan Collins," Rath says. Collins and other women Republican senators "found a way to get to [an ideological] middle and at least stop the train wreck from happening," he added. As more US states legalise same-sex marriage, Republicans can no longer remain so staunchly opposed to it, O'Connell argues. Gay marriage is growing in popularity nationally, he says, and Republicans must recognise their fierce opposition hurts them with younger voters. "There is a large recognition that among right-leaning independents and Republicans under 40 that it's a fact of life and it's here to stay," he says. Feehery says Republicans are not yet ready to embrace same-sex marriage, but leaving opposition to it out of the party message could prove successful over the long term. "I think we'd be better off not talking about it," he says. Republicans have taken the blame for shutting down the government in an attempt to defund President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law, known as Obamacare. But Republican strategists argue that Republicans must move beyond just denigrating Democratic proposals if they want to improve their brand among voters. "You win more elections by saying what you're for than what you're against," says Rath. Feehery asks, "What is their governing philosophy other than tearing stuff down? How do you build stuff up and does the party want you to build stuff up?" Complicating the matter, the party base "doesn't have any trust in government", Feehery says. "There's a big mood amongst the Tea Party... and conservative Republicans that they don't want accomplishments," Feehery says. "They don't want government to get bigger, they don't want new laws, they don't want anything. "Unless you're talking about getting rid of Obamacare or repealing some other laws, they don't want to talk to you. And that's problematic because their job as legislators is to pass laws and get things done." Feehery advises the party to focus on immigration reform, a budget deal, and reforms of the food aid programme, for example. "Try to get stuff done," he says. The partial government shutdown made it clear the Republican Party has been cleaved into two factions, so-called moderate establishment Republicans and more strident Tea Party Republicans pushing for confrontation. More moderate figures were seen on talk shows lambasting their more right-wing brethren, while Tea Party members threatened intra-party challenges against those in Congress they viewed as not toeing the party line. "They have to improve their communication strategy," O'Connell says. "Most Americans don't know a heck of a lot about policy or where either of the parties stands, but what they do know is tone and language, and if Republicans don't take a more appealing moderate tone and use less fire-and-brimstone rhetoric, they're never going to expand the tent of voters." The Republican strategist also argues that the party must move beyond the Washington lexicon in order to appeal to those outside the political bubble. "They have to do a better job of a sales pitch and they also have to better explain their positions," O'Connell claims. "They assume people know things about different budget issues or what's going on, and they really don't." He says former Republican President George W Bush connected with the public on a folksy level, and others in his party should take note. So, party leaders should dispense with all the budget talk with appearances on late-night comedy programmes. "You're not a hack by watching your words," O'Connell says. "That doesn't mean compromise your principles, it's just that so much more can be accomplished through perception than in actual policy positions." "The Republicans will know they've hit the right balance when people want to have a beer with them, and right now they don't." </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance comes as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>Singapore has achieved what only a handful of countries have - joining the so-called First World from the developing world. The city-state transformed itself from a British colonial outpost into the country with the third highest average income in the world within a matter of decades. Not only that, it has become an international financial centre attracting expatriates from across the globe. Foreign workers make up 40% of Singapore's labour market. Exporting consumer electronics has been the driver of growth for Asia since the 1960s, including for Singapore, which has also made the most of one of its few natural advantages, a deep water sea port. For Working Lives, the BBC's Linda Yueh has been meeting people around the island. Wang Han, a young Singaporean design engineer, is the type of highly skilled worker that leads international companies to set up plants in such an expensive country. She works on the innovative digital motor that powers hand dryers and vacuum cleaners for UK company Dyson. The motor is made in Singapore, but the products using it are assembled in Malaysia and sold around the world. That international outlook and the government's promotion of skilled workers also attracts foreigners to Singapore. Frazer Macdonald Hay came to teach young Singaporeans how to integrate design into engineering. He heads a 10-year programme between the Glasgow School of Art and Singapore's Institute of Technology. Chris Gill was attracted by the government's promotion of the financial sector, and a safe, clean environment to bring up his young family. He heads a global insurance company's Asian headquarters based in Singapore. Property developer Satinder Garcha, who according to one survey is Singapore's 46th richest person, plays polo each afternoon in the middle of the city, giving him a rather enviable work-life balance. But it's not just the rich who have a good standard of living. Office cleaner Liew Siew Giok works all day on her feet but goes home to a meal cooked by her Burmese maid. She lives with her extended family, who pay for the domestic help and her flat. The influx of foreigners has created social tensions and the rapid growth of the financial sector has raised some concerns about the future. However, what is clear is that Singapore has grown by being at the leading edge of know-how, giving not just the rich, but most people, a good quality of life. </body>

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, a study finds.</description>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in the journal Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found, which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H. habilis. But many features from the braincase were also "unique" to H. erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has given up the biggest collection of well-preserved early-human remains known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi collection also represents the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group that emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection; it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation that had previously puzzled researchers, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. The comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" had been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now. "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H. erectus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase; and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H. erectus, and not present in H. habilis and H. rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils could be "lumped into an evolving H. erectus lineage". "Only H. erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin, nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <title>Uganda seizes massive ivory haul</title>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But the government believes that renewable energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica. The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year. But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement. It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries. The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km. The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica. But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke. Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future. As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw. Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption. Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement. While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered. "The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News. "It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard. "Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen." In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance". They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation." However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting. "We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations." Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending. If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries. You can see more images by clicking here. Some viewers may find the last photo in the gallery distressing. The WPY exhibition opens on Friday 18 October at the Natural History Museum. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Nobel winner Higgs plans to retire</title>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85. In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title". Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners. The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time. He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life. "If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater." Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh. His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson. Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority. In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour. "I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you." "As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name." The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists. He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday. "I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed. "But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern." </body>

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. The work is published in PNAS journal. The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked. Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions. Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy. He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another. "This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos." Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University. She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers. The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters. These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos. Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions. After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes". "Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives". Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews. He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data". "But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation." </body>

      <title>'Diamond rain' on Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <description>Diamonds as big as jewels fall as "rain" on Saturn and Jupiter, seeded by giant lightning storms, according to new calculations by US scientists.</description>

      <body>Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated. New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say. Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond. These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference. The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear". "The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn. "People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it. "It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain." Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering. Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres. Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions. They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular. "It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines. "As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils." By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive. These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines. "Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid. "It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there." One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form. "Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines. The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed". "The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune. "And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible." However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's. "Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained. "We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all." Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research. The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System. A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth. But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling. Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet. "Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona. </body>

      <body>Scientists are asking for the public's help to track the spread of a greedy slug species threatening to eat its way through British gardens and crops. The Spanish slug was first reported in the UK in January by Dr Ian Bedford, head of entomology at the John Innes Centre, Norwich. It can survive many slug pellets, eats crops spared by native species and tolerate drier conditions. A red-brown colour, pale or rich, can identify a suspected Spanish slug. Scientists fear it could breed with our native species to form a hybrid. The Iberian invader, Arion vulgaris, can reproduce in greater numbers and has unappealing habits, including eating dead animals and excrement. During the winter, many disappeared underground or died but their eggs survived and the species may have returned in greater numbers. Scientists are asking people to look for the slugs under logs and plant pots in their gardens, and record and photograph their findings using a dedicated SlugWatch website. "We want photos and sightings from members of the public to help build a picture of how widespread the Spanish slug has become," said Dr Bedford. "The reports may also give us an idea of whether it is breeding with our native species to form a hybrid combining the worst of the Spanish slug with tolerance to frosts and cold from our own species." Keith Norman, technical director of farming company Velcourt, said farmers were using up their entire allowance of slug pellets early in the season, leaving no other means of control. "It is a disaster waiting to happen if the Spanish slug proliferates and establishes itself in the UK," said Mr Norman. "The Spanish slug causes more eating damage and cannot be controlled with existing measures." The Slugwatch website was designed by Rachel Ayers, 17, a sixth-former at at Notre Dame High School. Norwich. She also designed cards identifying different species of slug for use in schools. "We want people to survey their gardens, local areas and school grounds for slugs, or they can build a trap using instructions on the site," she said. "One of the most interesting parts of the project was learning about slugs and how to identify them," said Rachel. There are 30 native species in the UK, four of which are classed as pests: the netted or grey field slug, the garden slug, the keeled slug and the large black slug. Slugs play an important role in the ecosystem. They are natural composters, breaking down vegetation, and provide food for hedgehogs, toads and some garden birds. "We hope that as well as helping with research into the Spanish slug, people will learn a bit about the biology of these molluscs," said Dr Bedford. "You never know, we may even help inspire someone to become a malacologist in the future." </body>

The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Extreme weather 'keeps people poor'</title>
      <description>A new study says that extreme weather scenarios can counter efforts to reduce poverty for hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that extreme weather events will keep people poor in many parts of the world. The authors argue that where disasters like drought are prevalent, they can be the most important cause of poverty. They say that up to 325 million people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030. If aid is not used to reduce these risks, the progress made in fighting poverty could disappear. The report has been compiled by the Overseas Development Institute. It examines the relationship between disasters and poverty over the next 20 years, using population projections, climate models and estimations of how governments can cope with extreme events. The report suggests that up to a third of a billion people could be living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2030. In sub-Saharan Africa 118 million people in poverty will face extreme events. The big weather issues that will face most poor people are drought, extreme rainfall and flooding. An analysis of the data from rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that where there is a strong risk of drought, then drought is also the single most important factor in keeping people poor, outstripping ill health or dowry payments. "We've often heard that ill health is the biggest cause for impoverishment," said Dr Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change. "But in the data, in drought prone areas, the biggest cause is the drought - in areas exposed to these hazards, they are the key causes of impoverishment." Developed countries haven't recognised the role that these extreme weather events have in keeping people poor, he says. The big problem is that, at present, money tends to flow in response to disasters, not to prevent them. Dr Mitchell says the recent Cyclone Phailin in India is a good example. "The very fact that it killed so few people means that the chances of raising big finance for recovery efforts are going to be pretty slim. It has not got the big numbers attached to it," he said. "I think there's a direct link between the ability to raise finance and the number of people killed. It's a perverse incentive." Part of the problem is that donor countries are not prioritising aid at the countries that need it most, in terms of disaster risk reduction. "We've tended to provide much more financial support to a set of middle income countries, who can manage it better like the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia who made really great strides in protecting their populations," said Dr Mitchell. "What we've not done is focus on the poorest countries, the ones most exposed to issues like drought, for example, sub Saharan Africa, we've almost missed it off." The authors of the report argue that the way that vulnerable countries spend their money needs reforming too. Too often the money is spent on the capital city or on infrastructure and not on the poorest people. The report calls for the post-2015 development goals to include targets on disasters and climate change, to recognise the threat they pose to eradicating poverty by 2030. "If the international community are serious about ending extreme poverty they need to get serious about reducing disaster risk for the poorest people," said Dr Mitchell. "At the moment that's not happening, so the chance of ending extreme poverty is pie in the sky, it is just not going to work." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Air pollution 'still harming health'</title>
      <description>Some pollutants continue to pose a "significant threat" to European citizens' health and the environment, says a report by the European Environment Agency.</description>

      <body>Air pollution is continuing to damage European citizens' health and the environment, latest figures show. The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a "significant threat". However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide. In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution. EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog. However, he added: "Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. "To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation." The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels. As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer. It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity." The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data. Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: "Air quality is a central concern for many people. "Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels." He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review. Infant concerns A separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) "could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced". The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: "The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term." A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations. They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights. "Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults," they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings. "In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight." Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: "The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share." Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less. This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death. Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as "very concerning", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution. "It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health," he told BBC News. But he explained: "Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically. "Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly." Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was "very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution". But he added: "Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. "Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby." </body>

      <title>Germany delays CO2 limits for cars</title>
      <description>Germany persuades the EU to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars - and angers environmentalists.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24532284</url>

      <body>The German government has persuaded its EU partners to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars. Environment ministers agreed to revise a deal, reached in July, that set a limit of 95g per km for the average car. That target for CO2 emissions was to take effect in 2020. But Germany, famous for its high-performance cars, says the 95g limit should not take full effect until 2024. Green activists deplored the new delay as a "shameful sop" to polluters. A leading German Green Party MEP, Rebecca Harms, accused Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel of "riding roughshod" over the EU's democratic process, because the 2020 agreement had already been reached between the European Parliament and the Council - the EU ministerial grouping. "Weakening the agreed 2020 limits, which have long been known, is a shameful sop to German car manufacturers and will slow the development of new technologies to deliver more efficient and less polluting cars," Ms Harms said after the ministers' vote. Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are holding talks with the Greens on Tuesday on the possibilities of forming a coalition government. But many analysts believe a "grand" coalition between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is more likely to emerge. The UK was among the countries that supported the German environment minister's position on Monday, German ARD news reports. The German minister, Peter Altmaier, said "it's not a fight over principles but how we bind the necessary clarity in climate protection with the required flexibility and competitiveness to protect the car industry in Europe". Correspondents say there has been intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes, over the EU legislation. The emissions limits are part of the EU's drive to switch Europe to a low-carbon economy and slow the impact of climate change. There is also widespread concern about other pollutants from car exhausts. In a new report, the European Environment Agency (EEA) says more than 90% of European city dwellers are exposed to the most harmful particles in air pollution - PM and O3. Often the particles are transported for long distances across borders, it says. Under the German proposal, the 95g target for CO2 would be phased in - it would apply to 80% of cars by 2020, and then to all by 2024. The ministers' backing for Germany means a revised plan will now be negotiated with MEPs and the European Commission, and a deal may not be reached until after the May 2014 European elections. EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said she was disappointed and rejected the German proposal, Reuters news agency reported. Critics say the delay will undermine investment in greener alternatives, like electric cars and more fuel-efficient engines. </body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system. Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future. But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense. The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system. The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions. Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase. For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming. Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet. Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO. According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall. "This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said. According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant". "Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained. "This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact. "This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."

      <body>A major archaeological dig in Wiltshire has unearthed evidence of frogs legs being eaten in Britain, 8,000 years before France, it has been claimed. The team, which consists of Mesolithic period experts, also found other types of food including salmon and nuts. David Jacques, from the University of Buckingham, said people living there thousands of years ago were eating a "Heston Blumenthal-style menu". The team hopes to confirm Amesbury as the UK's oldest continuous settlement. The dig will run until 25 October. It is being filmed and made into a documentary by the BBC, Smithsonian, CBC and others to be screened at a later date. The project is being led by the University of Buckingham. Mr Jacques added: "This is significant for our understanding of the way people were living around 5,000 years before the building of Stonehenge and it begs the question - where are the frogs now?" The latest information is based on a report by fossil mammal specialist Simon Parfitt, of the Natural History Museum. He examined the discoveries from the dig which has resulted in 12,000 finds, including 650 animal bones, all from the Mesolithic era. Andy Rhind-Tutt, chairman of Amesbury Museum and Heritage Trust and co-ordinator of the community involvement on the dig, said the studies at Amesbury could help explain why Stonehenge was created. "No one would have built Stonehenge without there being something unique and really special about the area," he said. "There must have been something significant here beforehand and Blick Mead, with its constant temperature spring sitting alongside the River Avon, may well be it. "I believe that as we uncover more about the site over the coming days and weeks, we will discover it to be the greatest, oldest and most significant Mesolithic home base ever found in Britain." He added: "Currently Thatcham - 40 miles from Amesbury - is proving to be the oldest continuous settlement in the UK with Amesbury 104 years younger. "By the end of this latest dig, I am sure the records will need to be altered." The site already boasts the biggest collection of flints and cooked animal bones in north west Europe. The term Mesolithic refers to specific groups of archaeological cultures defined as falling between the Palaeolithic and the Neolithic periods. </body>

      <title>Edinburgh panda 'no longer pregnant'</title>
      <description>Edinburgh Zoo says its female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced. Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks. However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans. "Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy. "We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do." The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate. Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth. Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year. "What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense. "New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why." The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors. Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas. </body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests. Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction. A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction. The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal. "When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. "That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed. "This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups. "In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed," Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group. "If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said. "In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival. "What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]." Damp nipples The idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats. Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples. "Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained. The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper. The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time. "Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed. She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters. But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour." The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do. "More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on. "They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day." Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression. "Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young. "Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten. "So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group." </body>

It was considered a success - harnessing the power of the laptop and mobile phone to help scientists crunch vast sets of data and sort and classify distant galaxies. Since then, there has been a huge surge of public participation in "citizen science" projects - from counting birds in gardens, to spotting exo-planets in the data sent back from the Kepler space telescope.

Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from psychological studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. It is published in the journal PNAS. Among their hours of footage, the researchers captured this clip showing one of the "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug another juvenile that had just been attacked. </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why the chancellor wants China to invest in UK nuclear</title>
      <description>Why Chinese power giants are getting stake in UK's nuclear</description>

      <body>Part of what has been holding back the development of new nuclear power plants in the UK is their enormous cost. The government is refusing to finance these hugely pricey projects directly - although it will allow the owners of any new nuclear generators to charge well above the current market price for any power they produce in years and decades to come, so that the billions in development and construction costs can be recouped. The big attraction for the chancellor of allowing Chinese companies to invest in Britain's nuclear industry is that they have deep pockets. On his current trip to China, he has told the biggest Chinese nuclear companies they will in future even be able to own controlling stakes in British power stations, and not just small minority shares. When you think about the history of nuclear power, it may be shocking to some that businesses and investors from Britain - whose scientists and engineers were pioneers in this technology in the early days - will not own the new generation of nuclear power plants, and they may instead belong to China's nuclear power giants (as well as to the French and Japanese). The first of these deals with Chinese interests is expected to come next week, when the formal go ahead is expected for the construction of a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site in Somerset. This project will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EdF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. I am told that EdF has been negotiating with three nuclear giants, CGN, CNNC and SNPTC. One or two of these is likely to end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. George Osborne has met the bosses of all three of these companies, to give them comfort that he is keen for them to invest in British nuclear in general, and in Hinkley C in particular. Hinkley C's technology will be French, that of Areva. And the capital, the money, will be French, and - it now turns out - probably Chinese too. </body>

      <description>How much better is standing up than sitting?</description>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Citizen science is the new black</title>
      <description>Are citizen science projects advancing our knowledge?</description>

      <body>Citizen science - the trend for involving amateurs in research projects - is all the rage nowadays but is it real science or just good PR? "This is a blob, nothing too impressive. Oh dear, another blob, these are elliptical galaxies. Ooh look this is a merger..." The Oxford astronomer Dr Chris Lintott flicks through the first of 70,000 images from UKIDSS, the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey, that have been posted on the Galaxy Zoo website. "This one's a disc galaxy, so this might be what the Milky Way looks like from far away," he adds. The images, which have never been seen before, are part of the latest citizen science project run on the site. All you have to do is look at the pictures and classify the galaxies according to their shapes and features - does it have arms or a central bulge? Is it elliptical? Does the galaxy have a dust lane across the centre? The results should help astronomers to understand how galaxies form, but Galaxy Zoo is just the latest in a growing number of astronomical citizen science projects. The enthusiastic amateur can explore the surface of Mars or the Moon, study solar storms, and even hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. "It's a really exciting time," says Dr Lintott, "citizen science is booming. "That's because astronomers have painted themselves into a corner. They've got really good at collecting data but not so good at processing it. The human brain is still much better at sorting through these images and telling us what we need to know." But it is not just astronomy, citizen science is flourishing in pretty much every field of science. These days you can crunch data on cancer or monitor the spread of ash dieback while playing a simple computer game. You can map the human brain by colouring in neurones, track whales or watch wildlife in the Serengeti all from the comfort of your sofa. The field of natural history has a proud tradition of amateur involvement, and perhaps it is not so surprising to find citizen science flourishing here. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee there may be as many as 100,000 amateur naturalists actively collecting and contributing to citizen science projects in the UK - a volunteer effort worth £20m a year. A significant number of those projects are run by the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the Natural History Museum. Members of the public are encouraged to drop in with specimens, and to access the museum's extensive collections and talk to research staff. When I arrived to meet Dr John Tweddle a fungi workshop was in full swing. "It's exciting actually. You never know who's going to come through the door and what they're going to come with," says Dr Tweddle. "Anyone of any ability can come here to access the collections. Citizen science is really booming at the moment and the most effective projects are actually driving the research agenda. It's really useful science," he added. Of course there is nothing new under the sun. Although he would not have been familiar with the term, Charles Darwin built his theory of evolution by natural selection on the evidence supplied by hundreds of citizen scientists all over the world. Some 15,000 of the letters he sent or received survive at the Darwin Correspondence Project in the Cambridge University Library. Associate director Alison Pearn says Darwin could never have compiled the astonishing wealth of evidence to support his theory without the enthusiastic support of amateur naturalists. "Darwin corresponded with people from all walks of life, plant and animal breeders, gardeners and naturalists, but also diplomats and explorers. He couldn't have achieved what he did without their support. They were eager to contribute to the broadening of knowledge, so it's exactly the same as people do today in what we call citizen science," says Ms Pearn. The computer has added enormously to the power that the amateur can bring to bear on a problem, but interestingly Dr Lintott argues, it is the human brain's unique ability to spot inconsistencies in the vast sets of data scientists have amassed that makes citizen science so useful. "The best and most powerful information processor we have is still the one sitting between our ears. The human brain has a remarkable capacity for pattern recognition, but also for spotting the unusual, for being distracted by something that doesn't quite fit, and that's what we really need," he adds. </body>

      <title>Red destination: Choosing an ExoMars landing site</title>
      <description>Where should Europe's Mars rover try to land?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24466042</url>
      <date>1381536819</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70385000/png/_70385861_vlcsnap-2013-10-09-11h43m13s97.png</thumbnail>
      <body>The search for a suitable site to land Europe's ExoMars rover in 2019 is about to begin. A request will go out in the next few weeks to the scientific community, asking for expressions of interest to join a working group on the subject. Once this panel is in place, planetary researchers will then be invited to a meeting, likely to be in the spring of next year. This will formally kick-off the site selection process, which should take a couple of years to complete. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover - a roughly 350kg vehicle - is currently in the late stages of its design. Its mission will be to scour the surface of the Red Planet for signs of past or present life. It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present. But choosing the right place to go on Mars is critical to the whole endeavour. "I expect before the end of this month to issue the call to the science community, asking them for letters of interest in becoming a member of the site selection working group," Jorge Vago, Esa's ExoMars project scientist, told me. "We hope this will generate some buzz, and we hope to appoint the working group in November. It will consist of 10-12 external scientists, the project scientists and people from industry. "I would expect by the middle of next year we should have zeroed in on about four top candidate sites to start studying in detail." The scientific community will propose and argue the merits of various candidate destinations; new satellite imagery will be commissioned to inform the discussions. "Best science" will not, however, be the only consideration in making the ultimate decision. There are very important engineering constraints as well. No landing system yet devised can put down on a sixpence; the best you can hope for is a zone of confidence. Even for the brilliant "skycrane" used by the American's Curiosity rover, there was an ellipse of uncertainty that measured 20km by 7km at the final estimate. ExoMars' landing system is being constructed by the Russians and will be reminiscent of the Lunokhod Moon landers of the 1970s. The expected error ellipse will be considerably larger - about 100km by 15km. This means that wherever the scientists might like to go, the engineers will need to satisfy themselves that the rover can actually get there with minimal risk. So, for example, Gale Crater, the current location of Curiosity, would appear to be off the list of potential destinations because the Russian system will not have the accuracy to put ExoMars in this deep hole. The preponderance of slopes and boulder fields will be a consideration. And because ExoMars is a solar-powered rover, it will also be tied relatively close to the equator. So where will ExoMars go? Favoured Locations that lost out for Curiosity's attention are sure to crop up again. If I were to nominate an early runner in the race, it would probably be Mawrth Vallis. This is a favourite among many European planetary scientists, and is the location where Esa's Mars Express Orbiter spied abundant deposits of magnesium-rich and iron-rich clay minerals - a clear sign that a lot of water was once in contact with the rocks over an extended period. To find evidence of life, you must follow the water. Prof Dawn Sumner, who was co-chair of the Curiosity landing site working group, told me: "Mawrth Vallis is a site of exposed ancient martian crust - crust that is likely older than any rocks we've found on Earth. "The rocks there show spectral signatures of diverse hydrous minerals in data from Mars Express and Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. "These spectral signatures, within the oldest crust, make this site attractive, because it provides an opportunity to study the formation and alteration of some of the oldest parts of Mars. "Mawrth Vallis, like most of the ancient martian crust, shows evidence of multiple impacts; it is the high concentration of impact craters that indicates that it is old. "These areas show evidence of multiple fracturing events due to impacts, and the Mawrth Vallis landing ellipse identified as a Curiosity candidate shows many fracture patterns that may be related to various impact-forming events. The fracture patterns vary in the area and may be part of the landing site selection considerations." Wherever ExoMars goes, it will be given an initial mission lasting 218 martian days, or sols. It will get rolling quickly to make the most of the opportunity, and in this past week some of those who'll be involved have been getting a feel for what surface operations will involve. A dummy control room has been set up at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from where instrument teams have been sending commands to a prototype rover in the Atacama Desert. The boulder fields of this Chilean landscape look just like Mars, and it is cold and dry to boot. Twice a day, the Harwell team has been examining pictures acquired by the prototype, known as "Bridget", and then directing it to various targets to investigate. The commands are sent to the "relay orbiter" (in reality, a support team in the desert), where they are checked and uploaded into the rover. Bridget does its stuff, examining rocks with its "hand lens" and imaging the sub-surface with radar, before returning the data to England to repeat the exploration cycle. "Operations is a very different discipline from design and testing; and you have to get people into a different mind-set," says Lester Waugh from Astrium, the big European space company that is leading the manufacture of the ExoMars rover. "You think very much about risk, because if there is any danger that the rover may be damaged, you have to think very seriously before doing something - because you could lose your mission." </body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right?</title>
      <description>How accurate is the science in modern science fiction?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24518305</url>

      <body>New film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison. The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous. Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy. But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space. Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors. He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west. Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film. There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair. The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed. Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film. Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules. Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before. The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film. But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas. "The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there." There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept. "My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop." Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope. 2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space. "A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing. The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained. The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film. Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments. "Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves." "One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX." Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive". "Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott. "In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."

      <title>Salmond: 'Scotland's time is now'</title>
      <description>SNP leader Alex Salmond tells his party conference it is "time for independence" and that the case for voting yes will be made on 26 November.</description>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <body>The discovery of a girl found living on a Roma settlement in Greece has given the family of a missing Sheffield boy "great hope", his sister has said. Ben Needham, from Sheffield, was 21 months old when he went missing while on a family holiday in Kos in 1991. Ben's sister, Leighanna, said the girl's discovery, in a camp near Farsala, central Greece, was "very significant to Ben's case". "It gives us great hope that one day this will be Ben," she said. DNA tests revealed the child, called Maria and aged about four, was not related to the couple she lived with. Officials believe she may have been a victim of abduction or child trafficking. Ms Needham said this case was very similar to her family's and the Greek police's original thoughts about what had happened to Ben. "Child trafficking and illegal adoption in Greece has been pretty high and that's exactly what they thought had happened to Ben - that he was taken for a childless family and passed through Gypsy camps." A spokesman for Kate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine went missing in Portugal in 2007, said the case also gave them hope that she would one day be found alive. In October last year, police began a major new search for Ben's remains near the family's former farmhouse on Kos but nothing was found. His mother has always maintained her son is alive and was probably abducted. The Needham family was "delighted" at the discovery of the girl and hoped she could soon be reunited with her parents, said Ms Needham. "Hopefully, this will allow the Greek authorities to trace what happened to Ben. "It's now nearly Ben's 24th birthday and it's too, too long," she said. </body>

      <title>Dyke defends FA commission make-up</title>
      <description>Football Association chairman Greg Dyke responds to criticism of the make-up of his England commission.</description>

      <body>Football Association chairman Greg Dyke responded to criticism of his commission to improve the England team by stressing he is still keen to recruit black and ethnic members. Heather Rabbatts, the FA's only female board member, criticised the group's all-white, all-male make-up. Dyke admitted making a "mistake" in announcing only part of the line-up. But he added: "To suggest we never considered the ethnic balance of the commission is unfair." Jamaica-born Rabbatts, 57, wrote a letter to Dyke and fellow board members to complain about "a lack of diversity", saying she had no choice but to go public as there had been a "refusal to understand" her position in private. Rabbatts said: "The opportunity to lead an informed debate on the future of English players has been singularly damaged." In an open letter in response, Dyke said he was "sorry" Rabbatts felt the need to go public and "surprised" at the comments of his former board colleague at the BBC, where he was director-general from 2000 to 2004. Dyke wrote: "The make-up of the commission has been moving for some time, but I did explain to you and the board that we planned to appoint two or three additional members and would have done so this week had the issue of Roy Hodgson's dressing-room comments not blown up." The eight names announced for the commission are Dyke, FA vice-chairman Roger Burden, former England manager Glenn Hoddle, ex-England defender Danny Mills, League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson, Professional Footballers' Association chairman Ritchie Humphreys, Football League chairman Greg Clarke, and Crewe director of football Dario Gradi. The group will consider how to increase the number of England-qualified players appearing for the country's top clubs. In September, Dyke set England targets of reaching the Euro 2020 semi-finals and winning the World Cup in 2022. Dyke added in his letter that he had attempted to bring ethnic minority representation on to the FA commission by including Clarke Carlisle, the former chairman of the Professional Footballers' Association. He wrote: "We originally had Clarke Carlisle as a member, but the PFA decided they would rather have their new chairman [Humphreys] on the commission. We also identified other individuals from the BAME [Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic] community, who we felt would add strength and value to the commission. "Unfortunately, as they are active in football on a day-to-day basis, they felt the time commitments would be prohibitive. "As you know, we still want to see people with relevant experience from the BAME community on the commission and giving evidence to it." The new sports minister Helen Grant, who is also equalities minister, says she will speak to the FA next week to express her concerns about the commission. "Sports governing bodies must reflect the make-up of the diverse society that we live in," she said. "I expect the FA to ensure that voices from all backgrounds are heard loud and clear and contribute to this important piece of work to help strengthen English football. I will discuss the issue with the FA next week." Piara Powar, executive director of European anti-racism body Fare and a member of Fifa's new anti-racism taskforce, said: "Heather Rabbatts is the first woman and only ethnic minority on the FA Board. She has ideas, experience and nous. But seems to have been ignored. Why?" Lord Ouseley, chairman of anti-racism campaigning group Kick It Out, said he had raised the issue of the commission with Dyke, and questioned why he had not used Rabbatts' contacts and experience to bring on a suitable representative. "This has been a disaster for the FA in public relations terms. Heather must have been at her wits' end to go public like this," he said. "I find it very surprising therefore that someone as close to the chairman as Heather Rabbatts, with all her experience and contacts, was not asked for her advice on ensuring diversity." </body>

      <body>At least 10 people have been killed after a small tourist plane crashed near the city of Namur in south-east Belgium. It was carrying a group of skydivers and crashed shortly after take-off, killing all those on board, the local mayor has told the AFP news agency. The plane is thought to have taken off from the Temploux aerodrome and crashed around 10 minutes later in a field. Its wing appeared to have suffered some damage, Belgian media report. The small plane came down near the village of Marchovelette, 10km (six miles) from Namur. The passengers did not have time to jump out, the mayor of the nearby town of Fernelmont told AFP. Pictures show black smoke billowing from a burnt-out fuselage. "I just saw a plane lose its right wing in mid-flight and crash. I heard a massive 'bang' towards the south of Marchovelette," one witness told Belgian television. "I didn't see anyone escape with a parachute," the witness added. </body>

      <title>Titanic violin sold for £900,000</title>
      <description>The violin that was apparently played to calm the Titanic's passengers is sold for £900,000 at auction in Wiltshire - the highest price ever paid for memorabilia from the famous liner.</description>

      <body>The violin that was apparently played to calm passengers on the Titanic as it sank was sold for £900,000 in just 10 minutes at auction in Wiltshire. It was played by band leader Wallace Hartley, who died along with 1,517 others as the ship went down. It had a guide price of £300,000. The BBC's Duncan Kennedy said the buyer was believed to be British. Auctioneer Alan Aldridge said the violin was the "rarest and most iconic" piece of Titanic memorabilia. Many of the other items up for sale, such as photographs, newspapers and crockery, were sold for between £10 and a few hundred pounds. Mr Aldridge set the bidding at £50 for the violin, which was lot 230 of 251, so "two of his friends could bid" - but after just a couple of minutes it had passed £100,000. It eventually sold for £900,000 after fierce bidding between two telephone bidders. Hartley has become part of the ship's legend after leading his fellow musicians in playing as the vessel sank. They are famously said to have played the hymn Nearer My God To Thee. It had taken seven years for the Devizes auction house, Henry Aldridge and Son, to authenticate the instrument. Several experts were used, including forensic scientists who said the wood still contained salt deposits from the sea water. Some people still doubt whether the violin is the genuine article, however, and believe it could not have survived being submerged in the sea. But it is claimed the violin survived in a leather case strapped to Mr Harley's body who was found wearing his cork and linen lifejacket. A diary entry by his fiancee, Maria Robinson, said it was saved from the water and returned to her. Following her death in 1939, the violin was given to her local Salvation Army citadel and was later passed on to the current anonymous owner's mother in the early 1940s. The auction house said it had attracted interest from collectors all over the world and added that more than 315,000 people viewed it during a three-month exhibition in the United States. The most money previously paid for a piece of Titanic memorabilia is thought to have been a plan of the ship used in the 1912 inquiry into the sinking. This was bought by a private collector at auction for £220,000 in 2011. </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>UN calls for urgent Syria ceasefire</title>
      <description>The UN's humanitarian chief calls for an immediate ceasefire in the Damascus suburb of Moadamiyah to allow for aid delivery and evacuations.</description>

      <body>The UN's humanitarian chief has called for an "immediate pause in hostilities" in Moadamiyah, a rebel-held suburb of the Syrian capital, Damascus. Valerie Amos said 3,000 people were evacuated last Sunday, but that the same number were trapped in the town amid continuing shelling and fighting. Thousands of people were in a similar situations in towns across the country, she said. The army has previously said rebel-held areas must surrender or starve. Also on Saturday, activists said at least 16 soldiers were killed in a suicide bombing and fighting at a checkpoint near the mainly-Christian area of Jaramana. State media blamed "terrorists" for the explosion but did not give details. Rebels control much of the countryside around Damascus but Jaramana - a Christian and Druze area mostly loyal to President Bashar al-Assad - is still held by the government. In a statement, Baroness Amos said was "extremely worried by the situation unfolding across Syria where ordinary women, children and men are facing horrific violence and brutality from all sides of the conflict". She said relief workers had been unable to access Moadamiyah for months, and that the ongoing conflict was preventing any rescue mission from going ahead. "I call on all parties to agree an immediate pause in hostilities in Moadamiyah to allow humanitarian agencies unhindered access to evacuate the remaining civilians and deliver life-saving treatment and supplies in areas where fighting and shelling is ongoing," she said. But she said this was not the only area of concern, citing Nubil, Zahra, old Aleppo town, old Homs town and Hassakeh as other places where people were in danger. "Civilians must be allowed to move to safer areas without the fear of attack," she added. "It is vital that all parties to the conflict respect their obligations under international human rights and humanitarian laws to protect civilians and to allow neutral, impartial humanitarian organizations safe access to all people in need, wherever they are in Syria." Moadamiyah and at least two other Damascus's suburbs - Yarmouk and Eastern Ghouta - have been besieged by government forces for several months. The situation has become so desperate that earlier this week Muslim clerics issued a religious ruling allowing people to eat cats, dogs and donkeys just to survive. Those animals are usually considered unfit for human consumption in Islam. Syrian activists say they are now starting to record the first deaths of complications caused by malnutrition. On Friday, the US urged the Syrian government to allow relief convoys to reach starving civilians. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki warned that "those who are responsible for atrocities in the Damascus suburbs and across Syria must be identified and held accountable". More than 100,000 people have been killed in Syria's conflict, now in its third year. The unrest began in the midst of the Arab Spring regional uprisings, with protests against President Bashar Assad, before degenerating into civil war. A British surgeon who volunteered in a hospital in northern Syria for five weeks told the BBC on Friday that he had treated pregnant women deliberately targeted by snipers. David Nott said there "was definitely a game going on between the snipers". "One day we would receive patients who had purely groin wounds, another day purely chest wounds or purely abdominal wounds. Then another day full-term pregnant ladies were coming in having been shot." Most of the unborn babies and many of the women did not survive, he said. International efforts to halt the violence have consistently faltered, but last month the UN Security Council broke its deadlock, voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. The move followed international outrage at a chemical weapons attack near Damascus in August. UN experts are currently working in Syria, inspecting chemical weapons sites and destroying the arsenal, and say they have completed almost half their mission. </body>

      <title>Boy's sex attacks 'may escalate'</title>
      <description>Police in Manchester say they are concerned a string of sex attacks carried out by a boy aged as young as 12 could escalate.</description>

      <body>Police searching for a boy believed to have carried out sex assaults in Manchester say they are concerned the attacks could escalate. Detectives are appealing for anyone who recognises an e-fit of the boy, aged about 12, to contact them. They are linking three assaults that have taken place in the past month near the University of Manchester. Officers said they believed the boy had been recorded by CCTV cameras. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin said: "It is obviously very unusual and very worrying, that someone so young is committing such appalling attacks on women. "The women are traumatised as a result of what happened and are being offered support by specially trained officers. "Whatever the young boy's motivation, this is not a practical joke or a prank. His actions are disturbing "Given his young age, I would appeal to anyone who may know him - schoolteachers, community leaders or possibly even family members - to either alert the police or bring this young man to a police station as soon as possible. "We cannot allow these sexual assaults to escalate and we need to find him." The first two attacks took place within 15 minutes of each other on 21 September. A 27-year-old was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 18:15 BST before she screamed and the offender ran off. The next incident followed in Oxford Road when a 21-year-old woman was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left John Rylands library. She carried on walking on Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant, who was described as a young boy, aged about 12, who wore green jeans and glasses. The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 14:15 BST on 5 October. A 32-year-old woman was approached by two young boys and sexually assaulted by one of them. He was described as being of Asian heritage, aged 12 to 13, of slim build and wearing baggy trousers and carrying a rucksack. The woman pushed the boy away but he approached her again and sexually assaulted her for a second time before running off towards Pencroft Way with a second child. </body>

      <title>Roma girl 'can return to France'</title>
      <description>A Roma girl whose deportation sparked protests can return from Kosovo to finish her studies, but her family cannot, French President Hollande says.</description>

      <body>French President Francois Hollande has said a Roma girl who was removed from her school bus and deported can return to finish her studies, but that her family cannot. Leonarda Dibrani, 15, was expelled along with her parents and five siblings earlier this month after they lost their battle for asylum in France. The case has sparked protests by student groups across the country. A government investigation ruled that the deportation had been legal. But the report, released on Saturday, said any future such action against school children should be taken outside school hours. The Dibrani family left Kosovo for France five years ago and were living in Levier, in the Doubs region of eastern France. They cited discrimination in Kosovo as grounds for asylum. An order for their expulsion was issued after they lost their battle for asylum. After two postponements, it was rescheduled for October and the father, who was detained in a different town, was expelled on 8 October. Leonarda had stayed at a friend's overnight so was not at the family home when border police arrived to deport them. She was instead taken away by police in front of other students while on a field trip. The whole family were flown back to Kosovo that day. Mr Hollande told French TV: "If she makes a request, because of the circumstances, and because she wants to pursue her schooling in France, a welcome will be extended to her." But he stressed that the invitation was to Leonarda alone. The girl has said she will not return to France without her family. "I will not abandon my family. I'm not the only one who has to go to school, there are also my brothers and sisters," the AFP news agency quoted her as saying. Leonarda's father, Resat Dibrani, told reporters in Mitrovica, where the family are now living, that they would not stay in Kosovo. "I have no freedom here for myself, my children and my family. The police can say whatever they want, but for me, justice does not work in France." But he said the family would not be split up by his daughter going alone. "Either we all go together or nobody goes." Mr Dibrani had admitted this week that he had lied about the children's origins in the hope of boosting their asylum application - only he is from Kosovo but his wife and six children were all born in Italy. The mayor of the Italian town of Fano, where the family lived for several years, said they left after the authorities there threatened to take the children into care. "The children hardly ever went to school even though he had signed them up. He sent them out begging. They lived in the streets," Stefano Aguzzi told AFP. "We told him that he could not continue living here without paying for anything. We gave him a set of rules for him to be able to stay." Mr Aguzzi said that if the family returned, Fano officials would "not welcome them back with open arms" but that would "consider them like we do all the other immigrants". Hundreds of French students have staged protests against the deportation, and the manner in which Leonarda was removed, in Paris and other cities. Much of the anger has been directed at Interior Minister Manuel Valls, previously a popular figure. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says Mr Valls has also faced bitter recriminations from within his own party, accused of betraying the principles of the socialist government. But the government was also warned by the right-wing opposition that if it caved into the protests and allowed the family back, it would set a dangerous precedent, says our correspondent. Mr Hollande's invitation to Leonarda is perhaps the president's best way out of damaging few days, he adds. </body>

      <body>Australia's military is investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the huge bush fires burning in the state of New South Wales. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. It was the same day that a massive bush fire - which is still burning - began. About 200 homes have been destroyed in dozens of fires which have been burning for several days. The BBC's Jon Donnison in Sydney says this year's fires have come unusually early after unseasonably hot weather, and many are fearing a long and dangerous summer. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. The Australian Defence Force issued a statement about the fire burning between Lithgow and Bilpin, some 80 km (50 miles) north-west of Sydney, which is reported to have burned through 30,000 hectares (74,000 acres) and destroyed properties. It said it was investigating the circumstances of the fire, which began on defence land. "The fire started on 16 October, the same day that defence personnel were conducting an explosive ordnance training activity," the statement said. "Defence is investigating if the two events are linked. "Our thoughts are with those who have lost property or whose property is threatened by these devastating fires." Firefighters have been trying to make the most of a relatively cool day to tackle about 20 fires that are burning out of control, but higher temperatures and strong winds are expected to create difficult conditions in the coming days. New South Wales Rural Fire Service Deputy Commissioner Rob Rogers said Saturday's conditions were a "pause", but that the fire perimeter stretched for more than 500km. "We're by no means out of the woods," he told broadcaster ABC. "It's just calmed down a little bit and obviously we're bracing ourselves for these worsening conditions." Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said some of the fires were so large they would take some time to completely extinguish. "Firefighters will be working on these fires for weeks," he said. "It's all about reducing the risk of these fires to breach containment lines and run under hotter, drier, windier condition over coming days." Smoke and ash from the wildfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Banks 'said Royal Mail underpriced'</title>
      <description>Two investment banks canvassed by government 'warned Royal Mail sell-off price was too cheap'.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24592377</url>

      <body>The government ignored two banks that valued Royal Mail at £5bn, far more than shares were sold for, the Financial Times has reported. The government sold 60% of the postal service last week for £3.30 per share, but they soon passed £5. The FT said at least two banks had said shares would be worth up to £5 each. The government said banks' estimates had been made long before fresh factors arose, such as strike threats and financial uncertainty in the US. The government sought opinion from investment banks bidding to manage the sale, and selected Lazard as its independent adviser, before deciding to dispose of 60% of Royal Mail at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of £3.3bn. Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Bank of America Merill Lynch and UBS were appointed to lead the sale. Lazard has now been called in by the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee to answer questions on the pricing after shares had hit 508.3p, before closing at 502.5p. In a statement, a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said seven of the 21 banks that pitched in May to act for the government on the sale of Royal Mail were successful. "The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain," he said. "Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail future performance. "The range was wide with the median around £3.6 billion taking into account IPO [initial public offering] discount. The banks appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisers to government. He added: "The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September." Business select committee member Nadhim Zahawi said he believed the government had got its sums right. Conservative MP Mr Zahawi said he thought the government had acted wisely, given the risks of a flotation. He told the BBC News Channel: "The right thing to do is to bring in as many banks as possible. Ones that work closely with the Royal Mail, ones that advise the government. "When you are trying to get a placing that large away, what you don't want is egg on your face if it doesn't get the investment community excited." He added: "It feels to me that this story is a bit of sour grapes from a couple of banks who weren't very close to the business. "The problem to remember as well is that the government still has a substantial shareholding that at some stage it will want to sell down." Mr Zahawi warned of the danger that could be posed should the government face the prospect of selling its remaining stake at below the launch price and that it would be "far more negative than a successful IPO with shares going up". It was common practice to see government sell-offs priced at around 20% below full value so early investors are not penalised. He said: "Let's look at the share price in six months' time when the froth has gone away when you take out the initial spike and where the shares settle.

      <body>Friends have paid tribute to Felix Dexter, who died on Friday. The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52. Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy". He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away. "I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip." Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known." Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard. "This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs." He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out." Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers. He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career. Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and the Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater. </body>

      <body>A community venture company has issued shares so that Suffolk villagers can raise funds to buy their local pub. The Case Is Altered, in Bentley, near Ipswich, closed in March and its owner Punch Taverns has put it on the market for £240,000. A committee of seven people has formed Bentley Community Pub Ltd to raise the money to buy and refurbish it with the aim of reopening it next spring. People can buy a minimum of five shares for £50 each. David Westley, chairman of the new company, said: "We believe we are able to turn things around here. "Evidence shows that when people do buy their pubs the community has a much greater sense of ownership and people tend to go more." Mr Westley said the new company was a not-for-profit industrial and provident society and people could buy a maximum of £20,000 worth of shares. Punch said that, although the pub was on the market, it was still looking for a new licensee to run it. A spokesman said: "It is always our preference that our pubs continue to trade as pubs. "However, we do review our estate regularly and may explore other options around the future of some sites which could better fulfil their potential under different ownership." </body>

      <description>Hoffenheim launch a protest after Bayer Leverkusen's Stefan Kiessling heads the ball through a hole in the net.</description>

      <body>Hoffenheim are set to protest against a freak goal awarded to Bayer Leverkusen when Stefan Kiessling headed the ball through a hole in the side of the net. Referee Felix Brych failed to spot that Kiessling's header flew wide of the post in the 70th minute of Leverkusen's 2-1 Bundesliga win on Friday. Hoffenheim managing director Alexander Rosen said: "It's a scandal. "That was no goal, there are no two ways about it. We are definitely going to protest." Brych, a Fifa referee, said that no player had indicated it was not a goal. "I had a slight doubt but the reaction from the players was clear - nobody was against [the decision]," Brych said. "I checked with Kiessling. But no-one, not even him, said that it wasn't a goal. The ball was in the net and for everyone on the pitch it was a legitimate goal." Meanwhile, goalscorer Kiessling has apologised saying he could "fully understand the reactions" to the goal on his Facebook page.   "After seeing the replays on television, I can clearly see that it was not a legitimate goal," he said. "During the game, after heading the ball and turning my head, I did not exactly see whether the ball had gone into the goal or not. Somehow, the ball was lying in the goal and I said exactly that to the referee. "I'm sorry for all sports fans. Naturally, it's not nice to win like that. Fairness is important in sport, for us in the club and for me personally." In April 1994, Bayern Munich beat Nuremburg 2-1 after defender Thomas Helmer was awarded a goal despite the ball not going in. Nuremburg lodged a complaint, and Germany's Football Association ordered a replay, which Bayern won 5-0 on their way to clinching the title. Hoffenheim coach Markus Gisdol said: "It's definitely bitter for us and something like this has already happened once, and that game was replayed so I think we're going to see this game again. "Anything else would be a joke. You can't replay a Bayern Munich game, but not a Hoffenheim game." Several Hoffenheim substitutes raced behind the goal to examine the netting and appeared to try to point out Brych's error. But the referee was by then powerless to overrule his original decision. Rudi Voller, Leverkusen's sporting director, said: "That's not how we wanted to win the game. The fair result would have been a 2-2." Leverkusen were leading through Sidney Sam's 26th-minute opener when the controversy happened. Germany international Kiessling headed a corner wide of the near post, and could be seen turning away in frustration before Brych awarded the goal. The referee then awarded Hoffenheim a generous penalty when Roberto Firmino was fouled a foot outside the penalty area. But Firmino's spot-kick was saved. Sven Schipplock pulled a goal back for Hoffenheim two minutes from the end, but they could not save a point and fell to their first home defeat of the season. Brych, who refereed England's 3-2 friendly win over Scotland at Wembley in August, sent off Manchester United captain Nemanja Vidic during a 2-0 Champions League defeat away to Romanian side Otelul Galati in October 2011. The win took Sami Hyypia's side top, although Bayern Munich can overtake them by beating Mainz on Saturday. </body>

      <description>Manchester United slip eight points behind leaders Arsenal as Southampton score a late equaliser at Old Trafford.</description>

      <body>Manchester United manager David Moyes endured another afternoon of frustration as Southampton snatched a last-gasp equaliser to stun Old Trafford. Captain Adam Lallana tapped in from a yard out with only a minute of normal time remaining to give the visitors a share of the spoils and leave United eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal. The champions had looked on course for what would have been a ninth successive win over the Saints. Teenager Adnan Januzaj produced another moment of brilliance to set Robin van Persie on his way to put United in front midway through the first half. The hosts might have put the game beyond Southampton as both Van Persie and the excellent Wayne Rooney hit the crossbar. However Mauricio Pochettino's side will feel their dominance of possession more than warranted a point, even if they lacked a genuine cutting edge for long periods. For United, there had been signs that they were beginning to turn the corner after the club's worst start to a Premier League season. The movement and understanding between Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj bordered on the telepathic. Even as Moyes's side were forced back for long periods of this game, the trio ensured this was a United side that bristled with attacking menace for all 90 minutes. Januzaj, 18, who signed a five-year contract before the game, once again displayed signs of his immense talent with a verve and energy that glowed throughout. His battle with Nathaniel Clyne was a feature of the first-half as Southampton plotted their passing angles with patience and precision, forcing United onto the back foot. Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama pulled the strings in midfield, while the dynamism of Lallana meant Saints always had options, even if chances on goal were scarce. Jay Rodriguez headed over and Dani Osvaldo might have done better with only David De Gea to beat and, as Southampton bordered on the profligate, United were far more ruthless. Van Persie had twice gone close in the opening 20 minutes, before Rooney's sublime pass set him in on goal once more, only for an offside flag to deny him the chance to finish. However, the brilliance of Januzaj ensured United would not be denied for long. Picking the ball up in his own half, Januzaj threaded a 40-yard pass into the path of Rooney to slice Southampton open in the blink of an eye. Rooney's shot was brilliantly blocked by goalkeeper Artur Boruc, but Van Persie was quickly onto the rebound, rolling the ball beyond the despairing dive of Dejan Lovren to give United the lead. It was the first goal Southampton had conceded in almost seven hours of Premier League football but it came from a familiar source - this was Van Persie's fifth goal in as many appearances against Saints but his first for five Premier League matches. For a five-minute spell, Saints looked lost. Rooney rattled the crossbar with a thunderous shot but the visitors weathered the United storm and came again - Van Persie heading Lovren's header off his own line just after half-time. And yet, United always carried the greater threat. Their movement in attack constantly confounded Southampton's defenders, with Rooney, Van Persie and Januzaj swapping places and eluding markers at will. The Dutchman might have a second goal as he headed onto the crossbar on the hour. Moments later, Januzaj was in the thick of the action once more, unleashing a dipping, swerving left-foot drive that Boruc somehow clawed away. Though Southampton refused to lie down - Lallana testing De Ge with a low shot - hope appeared to be draining away. However, when Lovren forced Shaw's corner towards goal, Lallana got the faintest of touches to beat De Gea to earn Saints a point and extend United's poor league run to only two wins in seven matches. </body>

      <body>Chelsea fought back from a goal down to thump Cardiff after scoring an equaliser which should not have stood. Jordon Mutch ran through to put Cardiff ahead after David Luiz's mistake. But Eden Hazard levelled after Samuel Eto'o kicked the ball away as Bluebirds keeper David Marshall bounced it, which according to Fifa's rules is a foul. A well-worked Eto'o goal put Chelsea ahead and, after their boss Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands, Oscar and Hazard sealed the victory. Chelsea climb to second in the table but the scoreline was harsh on Cardiff - starting with the home side's equaliser in the 32nd minute. The laws of the game stipulate that the ball is considered under the goalkeeper's control when he bounces it, but referee Anthony Taylor allowed play to continue before Hazard fired home. Cardiff had taken the lead with a bizarre goal of their own. Luiz casually let the ball run past him after Ramires played it back to Cech, allowing Mutch to nip in and coolly slot home. The Welsh side were showing no ill-effects of a turbulent two-week period that saw the future of boss Malky Mackay put in doubt when his head of recruitment, Iain Moody, was replaced by unknown 23-year-old Kazakh Alisher Apsalyamov. Mackay has insisted he has no intention to quit, despite reports that Bluebirds owner Vincent Tan is also suggesting substitutions and tactics during games. Tan was not at Stamford Bridge and Mackay's tactics proved effective as his side soaked up Chelsea's attacks despite conceding the majority of possession, and frequently threatened on the break. John Terry twice went close to levelling with headers but it took a superb save from Petr Cech to stop Peter Odemwingie extending Cardiff's lead with a header from Peter Whittingham's free-kick. Chelsea's frustrations continued after their controversial equaliser, at least until Eto'o scored his first Premier League goal after 66 minutes by latching on to a Hazard pass and burying the ball past Marshall. The Bluebirds responded well and almost hit back when Kim Bo-Kyung stung Cech's palms. Mourinho had to watch what looked like being an anxious final 20 minutes from the stands, with Taylor ordering him from his technical area after he persistently complained to fourth official Trevor Kettle about the referee's decisions. But Oscar's fine strike from the edge of the box gave his side breathing space in the 78th minute and Hazard made it four soon after, dancing into the box before beating Marshall at his near post. </body>

      <description>Replacement Gareth Davies' late try gives Cardiff Blues a dramatic win against Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park.</description>

      <body>A late try by replacement Gareth Davies gave Cardiff Blues a dramatic win over Heineken Cup holders Toulon at the Arms Park. Rhys Patchell and Leigh Halfpenny's first-half kicking duel with Jonny Wilkinson ended level at 6-6. Wilkinson kicked three more penalties after the break with Halfpenny twice responding for the hosts. But Davies broke free from a tackle to score two minutes from the end and Halfpenny converted. Having conceded five first-half tries in defeat at Exeter Chiefs in their opening game, director of rugby Phil Davies had demanded a telling response from his players. The hosts earned a bonus point for their four-tries second-half effort at Exeter and Davies hoped they would maintain that momentum against the wealthy French club. But few could have expected the Blues to give Phil Davies such a memorable 50th birthday present as they toppled the star-studded French Top 14 team. The Blues also had to contend with a late change when skipper and hooker Matthew Rees was ruled out by illness and Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert failing to come out for the second period after suffering a leg injury. Marc Breeze came into the starting line-up while ex-Toulon prop Gethin Jenkins took over the captaincy. The visitors found the Blues' defence as impenetrable as it had been porous at Sandy Park in the opening round. In midweek the Welsh region parted company with defence coach Rob Powell and announced Pontypridd head coach Dale McIntosh as his replacement. McIntosh - known affectionately as The Chief - was at Sardis Road to end 24 years of playing and coaching as they took on London Welsh in the British and Irish Cup. But he will have been heartened to learn of the Blues' defensive effort, particularly in the dying moments as Toulon tried and failed to hit back. Toulon comfortably saw off Pro12 leaders Glasgow as their title defence opened and their early, attack-minded approach seemed to indicate they were confident of a similar effort in the Welsh capital. But the Blues rose to the criticism that followed their defeat at Exeter to regain respect in Europe in conditions that began in drizzle, continued in a deluge and ended in autumn sunshine. The hosts' pack may not have matched their much-vaunted opponents at the scrum and Toulon's physical superiority was often evident at the breakdowns. But the Blues' line-out was solid and while fly-half Patchell occasionally lost concentration, his tactical kicking was impressive. A fourth-minute long-range Patchell penalty began the duel in which Wilkinson's penalty brace took his side ahead. Halfpenny levelled after lock Bakkies Botha's forearm challenge on Josh Navidi at a ruck and the teams were tied 6-6 at the break. Wilkinson added two more penalties early in the second period, but missed two more chances before Halfpenny brought the hosts level. Former England and Lions fly-half Wilkinson kicked his side ahead with a fifth shot from a narrow angle with eight minutes remaining. But after Cory Allen's break took the Blues deep into Toulon's 22, Sam Warburton maintained the momentum with his own surge. Davies, who had replaced Patchell as Wilkinson kicked his final penalty, went on an arcing run and after not being held in a tackle by Toulon's desperate defence, bounced off the synthetic surface to score. Halfpenny added the conversion and Toulon's frantic efforts to hit back were thwarted. Cardiff Blues: Leigh Halfpenny; Alex Cuthbert, Owen Williams, Cory Allen, Harry Robinson; Rhys Patchell, Lloyd Williams; Gethin Jenkins (capt), Marc Breeze, Scott Andrews, Bradley Davies, Filo Paulo, Josh Navidi, Sam Warburton, Robin Copeland. Replacements: Richard Smith for Cuthbert (41), Gareth Davies for Patchell (72), Benoit Bourrust for Andrews (59), Lou Reed for Paulo (75). Not Used: Kristian Dacey, Sam Hobbs, Rory Watts-Jones, Lewis Jones. Toulon squad: Delon Armitage; Josua Tuisova, Maxime Mermoz, Matthew Giteau, Rudi Wulf; Jonny Wilkinson (capt), Frederic Michalak; Xavier Chiocci, Jean-Charles Orioli, Martin Castrogiovanni, Bakkies Botha, Ali Williams, Juan Fernandez Lobbe, Steffon Armitage, Chris Masoe. Replacements: Benjamin Noirot for Chiocci (41), Emmanuel Felsina for Orioli (41), Carl Hayman for Castrogiovanni (41), Jocelino Suta for Botha (46), Juan Smith for S Armitage (69).

      <body>England women lost seven wickets for 14 runs as they slipped to an 11-run defeat against West Indies in their second game of the tri-series. Chasing 141 for victory in Barbados, the tourists collapsed from 82-1 to 96-8 before finishing on 129-8. Shaquana Quintyne, the 17-year-old leg-spinner, claimed 5-16, including the wicket of captain Charlotte Edwards, who top-scored for England with 39. England face New Zealand, whom they beat in their opening game, on Tuesday. Spinner Danielle Hazell took 3-19 from four overs and seamer Jenny Gunn 2-24 as West Indies, who now top the table, posted 140-6 after losing the toss. Stafanie Taylor made 40 at the top of the order, while Deandra Dottin hit three sixes in her 19-ball 32 and Stacy-Ann King smashed 24 off 10 deliveries to add late impetus to the Windies innings. In reply, Edwards and Lauren Winfield, whose 36 spanned 25 balls, shared an opening partnership of 69 inside 10 overs, but Quintyne removed both to initiate England's collapse. They never recovered from losing Natalie Sciver, Sarah Taylor, Tamsin Beaumont and Gunn in the space of 10 balls, while Hazell and Holly Colvin's unbroken ninth-wicket stand of 36 proved futile. </body>

      <body>Mesut Ozil scored twice as a late burst sealed Arsenal's victory over Norwich and extended their lead at the top of the Premier League. The Gunners looked lethargic after the international break before Jack Wilshere's superb volleyed opener and Ozil's headed goal. Jonny Howson found the bottom corner with 20 minutes left to fray nerves. But Aaron Ramsey scored a lovely ninth goal of the season to make it 3-1 before Ozil grabbed an easy second. Although Norwich threatened on several occasions, the visitors were caught out by three moments of class as Arsenal warmed up for their Champions League clash with Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday with a clinical win. Wilshere's first-half strike was the pick of the goals, but Ozil's first and Ramsey's waltzing run to continue his fine form, lit up the Emirates as the Gunners extended their unbeaten run to 12 games. Defeat meant Chris Hughton's Norwich side have lost four of their last five league games and remain in the bottom three. This time last season, the Canaries beat the Gunners 1-0 at Carrow Road, but there is a new confidence to Arsenal this season. Ozil scored his second and third Arsenal goals since joining the club on transfer deadline day for a club record £42.4m from Real Madrid. And such is the depth of the squad that Ramsey was replaced in the starting XI by the returning Santi Cazorla. The Spaniard was never far from the heart of the Gunners' best moments. He had an early shot saved and was involved in a spell-binding opening goal. Wilshere was the architect, collecting the ball deep in his own half before feeding Cazorla on the left and receiving it back near the edge of the area. There followed a delightful exchange where Wilshere and Olivier Giroud combined with three superb flicks before Wilshere volleyed in from close range after 18 minutes. Norwich, who have not won in north London since the opening day of the 1992 Premier League season, looked certain to extend this run. But the flow of the game changed with Mathieu Flamini's departure. Earlier the French midfielder clashed heads with Alexander Tettey and the hosts missed his discipline in front of the back four. Norwich continued to press in the second half with Martin shooting wide when well-placed following a free-kick and Robert Snodgrass had a shot saved. However, Ozil then put his stamp on the game with another display of undoubted class. Again it came from a break near the Arsenal penalty area. Cazorla fed Giroud on the left and Ozil carefully guided the resulting cross past the helpless Ruddy after 58 minutes. That signalled a collective sigh of relief around the Emirates but 12 minutes Howson fired into the bottom corner after Per Mertesacker failed to adequately clear Martin Olsson's low cross. The game was in the balance but as Norwich threw more men forward, two goals in five minutes sealed the victory. Ramsey danced around the Norwich defence to fire in and then Ozil grabbed a close-range second after being set up by the unselfish Welshman. </body>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <body>The Aberdeen North Labour MP Frank Doran is to stand down at the next general election in 2015. He has represented the people of the north east city at Westminster since 1987. Mr Doran told the party he believed it was now time to step aside and give someone else the chance to fight for the seat. The 64-year-old said it had been an "enormous privilege to represent the city in parliament". Mr Doran was elected MP for Aberdeen South in 1987 and subsequently for Aberdeen Central in 1997. Following boundary changes in 2005, he was then elected to represent Aberdeen North. The MP said: "By the next election I will have been an MP for 23 years I think it is time to step aside to give someone else the chance from the Labour Party the opportunity to represent Aberdeen in Westminster." Mr Doran was shadow minister for energy between 1988 and 1992, he has sat on the culture, media and sport select committee and has campaigned for improved safety in the North Sea. </body>

      <title>GP exam 'unfair to minorities'</title>
      <description>British ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, an investigation commissioned by the General Medical Council finds.</description>

      <body>UK ethnic minority doctors are four times more likely than white candidates to fail their clinical GP exam, the General Medical Council has found. The review into 5,000 candidates was ordered after ethnic minority students complained the exam was unfair. Prof Aneez Esmail, an expert on racism in the NHS who led the investigation, said "unconscious bias" could explain the findings. But the Royal College of GPs, which sets the exams, denies they are unfair. RCGP chairwoman Dr Clare Gerada said the college took equality and diversity issues "extremely seriously". She added that the college: "strongly refutes any allegations that the exam is discriminatory in any way". The Clinical Skills Assessment (CSA) - introduced in 2010 - is a practical test in which trainee GPs are assessed by an examiner while they treat actors in a mock-surgery setting. They have up to four attempts to take the test which they must pass before they can practise as a GP. During the six-month review for the GMC, Prof Esmail analysed data on more than 5,000 candidates who sat the CSA exam over a two-year period. He said he could not exclude racial discrimination as the cause of the findings. He told BBC One's Breakfast: "Many of us who do work in this area describe the problem of unconscious bias. "So I think that what might be happening, especially with the white British graduates compared to the ethnic minority British graduates, is that - without realising it even perhaps - they may be assessing it in a different way." "So I don't think that it's the examiners saying 'oh we don't like ethnic minorities' - it doesn't work like that anymore," he added. "It's all this unconscious stuff that goes on which we need to be aware of." He said all British doctors, whether white or from ethnic minorities, had "gone through medical school and passed all that and so we're not talking about people who aren't as good as - they're exactly the same". He said the test was "a relatively new technique that's being used and it's bound to improve as time goes on". He has made a number of recommendations to try to combat bias in the exam including having more examiners and actors who are from ethnic minority backgrounds. But the RGCP's Dr Clare Gerada said the review found "no evidence, either through the examiners or through the actors, or through the process of the examination, of discrimination". She added that, "in fact, what it showed was that it was probably preparedness for the exam that was a factor". "We already take comprehensive steps to ensure that the exam is fair and equitable to all candidates," she told BBC News. "This exam is designed for doctors to practise independently; it is not an exam that has to be passed by everyone. I think that is a very important issue. "Of course we cannot be complacent and we continue to make sure the exam does not have bias built in." The review also found that trainee GPs from abroad were 14 times more likely to fail the CSA exam than white British doctors. "We also know that eventually they pass," Dr Gerada said. "We also know that this is a culturally specific exam - it stands to reason if you are born and brought up in this country, within the NHS, that you have an advantage," she added. "If I go to India and sit an exam designed for doctors to practise in India, I will be at a disadvantage." GP Una Coales, meanwhile, said that, "because they use predominantly white actors, even the white actors may not even be aware that they have hidden bias against foreigners". "So if they hear an Indian dialect, for instance, they might pretend that they don't understand them and they might subconsciously withhold vital clues," she said. She said the actors could "give away the agenda or the concern right away if he happens to like you or can withhold it for eight minutes of a 10-minute exam". Organisations representing ethnic minority doctors have threatened legal action against the RCGP. Dr Ramesh Mehta, president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO), said: "Hundreds of doctors' careers have been damaged because they have repeatedly failed the CSA exam. "They are facing institutional bias and are unfairly failing the exam despite extensive training and knowledge." BAPIO has been given permission to launch a judicial review against the RCGP and the GMC over the exam. The General Medical Council said it took the findings of the independent review seriously. "We agree with Prof Esmail that there is no room for complacency - we want to work with him and all those involved in this area," chief executive Niall Dickson said. "We are duty-bound to act where there is evidence of a problem and his report and recommendations make a powerful case for action." </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>
      <date>1382115902</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The deadliest poisons are often central to the most important medicines, as Michael Mosley explains.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24551945</url>
      <date>1382061345</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70557000/jpg/_70557008_small-poison-bottle.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <body>A taxi driver was shot after his passengers got into an argument with another group of men on a petrol forecourt in Merseyside, police said. A silver Skoda Octavia was shot at after four men inside argued with six men at the garage on Whitefield Drive, Kirkby, at 01:15 BST. The driver, 61, was not thought to be the intended target, police said. He is being treated in hospital for serious injuries to his arm and chest and his condition is said to be stable. There were no reports of other injuries. All the men had left the scene when emergency services arrived and a search for them is ongoing, police said. They are all described as being white, with five wearing dark-coloured clothing and the sixth wearing a cream coloured Adidas-type top. Supt Kevin Wellens said: "This thoughtless and reckless type of behaviour cannot be tolerated, and we are fortunate that no one else was injured particularly as this took place on a garage forecourt. "I would appeal to members of the community who know the people involved to come forward so we can take positive action and take the offenders off the streets before anyone else gets hurt." </body>

      <title>Trauma centre 'alternative to Maze'</title>
      <description>Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt says an international trauma centre should be built as an alternative to the Maze Peace Centre.</description>

      <body>Ulster Unionist leader Mike Nesbitt has said an international trauma centre should be built as an alternative to the Maze Peace Centre. Mr Nesbitt made the proposal during his speech at his party's annual conference. EU funding of £18m was removed after the DUP withdrew its support for the proposed peace centre on the site of the former prison. Mr Nesbitt said what was missing from the debate was an alternative plan. "I offer that alternative, an alternative that addresses the hidden legacy of the Troubles - poor mental health and well-being. I am sorry to report, we are world-leaders in this field," he said. "Let us create an international mental health centre: a facility that will be a global centre of excellence to help those who suffer trauma, whatever the cause. I am talking about the best in the world." He added: "The world has been generous to us, with their support and their money. "Let us repay them with a centre that will offer help and hope to everyone. Let Northern Ireland become known as the 'go to' place for soldiers traumatised in war, to children traumatised by a gun attack on their school campus, to the survivors of train and plane crashes." He suggested Ormiston House in east Belfast as a possible venue for the new trauma centre, saying it would cost a fraction of the £18m funding for the Maze peace centre. Ormiston House, a 19th Century mansion set on a 13 acre site close to Stormont, is owned by the Northern Ireland Assembly. It bought the Grade B listed building for £9m in 2001, but ten years later, it put the property on the market with an asking price of just £2.5m. It was not sold and the price had since dropped to £1.6m. As UUP leader Mr Nesbitt campaigned against the proposed peace centre at the Maze. "We forced Peter Robinson into a massive u-turn on the Maze, and we did it without a riot, without street protests, without so much as a white line protest. Brains, not brawn," he told the conference. He said another fight his party was committed to was against the "republican campaign for equivalence". Mr Nesbitt said republican paramilitaries had chosen to get involved in violence, they had not been forced into it. "If I forever associate a united Ireland with no warning bombs like Bloody Friday and La Mon, is that my fault? Republicans chose it should be that way," he said. "I believe history will record that among the many things the IRA blew away was the chance for a united Ireland. "By contrast, in a few months time, Scottish nationalists will see a referendum on Scottish independence. Not a gun discharged. Not a bomb detonated. Not a single act of terror required." Mr Nesbitt said the Ulster Unionists wanted the education portfolio at Stormont and would strive to bring in a single education system in Northern Ireland. The Ulster Unionist leader also called for a new covenant with the people of Northern Ireland. "A covenant that recognises that we can do better for all our people by shaping a fairer education system, a stronger economy, better housing and a health service not only free at the point of delivery but with delivery points that are accessible and appropriate to the needs of our people," he said. The speech was Mr Nesbitt's second as party leader - a period which has seen three sitting MLAs quit the party because of differences. Basil McCrea and John McCallister left to form the new party NI21, and David McNarry switched to UKIP. Earlier a prominent speaker was Jim Nicholson, the party's candidate in next year's European elections that will be the first to be fought under Mr Nesbitt's leadership. Regional Development Minister Danny Kennedy told the conference it was a long time since the UUP was so united and the DUP so divided. Other speakers will include the new shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, Ivan Lewis. </body>

      <body>Roads and shops have been closed as flash flooding caused chaos around Cardiff on Saturday afternoon following heavy rain. Areas affected included Pentrebane, Llandaff, Roath, Cathays and parts of north Cardiff. Police were forced to close roads in Ely and Culverhouse Cross as localised flooding made conditions treacherous. At least six fire engines were dealing with separate incidents across the city at one point. South Wales Police said traffic was at a standstill around the Culverhouse Cross shopping area and warned people to keep away. A spokesperson said officers were closing the road leading to Marks and Spencer and Tesco at Culverhouse Cross after both shops had been affected by the rain. Water was reported to be getting into both stores forcing people to be evacuated. There were also said to be several flooding incidents in Ely, including one at a private property, and Mill Road was closed. Eluned Haf, of Southerndown in the Vale of Glamorgan, said she was stuck for two hours in the Marks and Spencer car park after the shop was evacuated. "I was taking the kids off to my mam at Culverhouse Cross and the rain came down," she said. "I got into the MandS car park and thought 'thank God for that'. I went to hand the kids to my mam and the whole building was evacuated. "I was stuck in the car park for two hours." She said there was gridlock on the roads in the area as the nearby Tesco was also evacuated. </body>

      <body>A service has taken place to mark the first anniversary of a mother's death in a series of hit-and-runs in Cardiff. Karina Menzies, 31, was killed outside Ely fire station while on a school run with two of her three children. Matthew Tvrdon, 32, who has paranoid schizophrenia, drove on an eight-mile "journey of mayhem" killing Ms Menzies and injuring 17 others. He admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and was detained under the Mental Health Act. He also admitted seven counts of attempted murder and other charges including three counts of grievous bodily harm with intent. A memorial party was held on Friday evening by Ms Menzies' sister Samantha who is bringing up her three nieces Sophie, 12, Ellie, nine, and Tiana, four. And a church service was held on Saturday at Ely's Church of the Resurrection before the family held a private memorial where lanterns and fireworks will be released. The church became a focus for the community in the aftermath of the tragedy. "The year has been absolutely crazy," said 27-year-old Samantha. "My partner Lee and I are just run off our feet but we wouldn't have it any other way. "The girls are doing well and doing well in school. They obviously have their moments though. "The memorial party was a way for me to thank people for what they've done for the family and to thank the community." Terror was brought to west Cardiff for 30 minutes in October last year when Tvrdon was said in court to have used his van as a "weapon". Adults and children were injured in collisions in Ely and nearby Leckwith as he knocked people over like "skittles". In the most serious incident he targeted Ms Menzies as she walked on the forecourt of Ely fire station with two of her children, Ellie and Tiana. Sophie was on holiday in Florida at the time. She pushed her children out of the way before the van hit her. Tvrdon was told he would be released from Ashworth maximum security hospital in Merseyside only if a mental health tribunal was satisfied he should be released. The Reverend Jan Gould, priest-in-charge at the Church of the Resurrection, said: "The tragedy devastated our community last year and I think it's important that we mark this first anniversary. "Some of the victims were in hospital last year and so were unable to attend the service we had on the weekend it all happened. "They have said they would like an opportunity to attend something in church as a way of helping them to 'move on'. "I hope this service will give the community the opportunity to come together again and show their support for those whose lives were completely turned upside down a year ago in that dreadful incident." </body>

      <description>At least 16 people are killed after a suicide bomber blows himself up in a crowded restaurant in the central Somali town of Beledweyne.</description>

      <body>At least 16 people have been killed and more than 30 injured after a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded restaurant in the central Somali town of Beledweyne. The Islamist militant group al-Shabab has said it carried out the attack. The Somali government, backed by troops from several African countries, is fighting al-Shabab for control of the country. Al-Shabab said its target was Ethiopian and Djiboutian soldiers in Beledweyne. The bombing occurred at a tea shop popular with the troops in Beledweyne, 300km (185 miles) north of the capital, Mogadishu, close to the border with Ethiopia. "Our main target was Ethiopian and Djibouti troops who invaded our country," Sheikh Abdiasis Abu Musab, al-Shabab's military operations spokesman, said. But witnesses, including a Somali MP in Beledweyne, Dahir Amin Jessow, have told the BBC that most of those killed were civilians. "There is a lack of medicine in the hospital and they can't cope with the flood of wounded patients, so we asked the central government to send us planes to evacuate patients," Mr Jessow said by phone. Al-Shabab militants have been driven out of Somalia's major towns, including Mogadishu and the key southern port of Kismayo, by a UN-mandated African Union force of some 18,000 soldiers. But the militants still control large parts of southern Somalia. Last month, the group claimed the attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in which 67 people died during a four-day siege. It said it staged the attack in response to Kenya's army carrying out operations on Somali territory. </body>

      <description>President Alpha Conde's ruling party in Guinea won last month's parliamentary poll, electoral officials say, but the opposition rejects the result.</description>

      <body>President Alpha Conde's ruling party in Guinea took just under half of the seats in last month's parliamentary poll, electoral officials have said. They said the Rally of the Guinean People (RPG) secured 53 seats in the 114-member parliament. The main opposition party had 37 seats, while the rest went to smaller parties. The opposition said it would not recognise the result of the poll, which international observers said was marred by "irregularities". Opposition spokesman Sydia Toure said the announced result of the 28 September election did not reflect "the people's vote". Earlier, the observers said that "breaches and irregularities were observed in a certain number of constituencies, preventing a significant number of votes from being taken into account". The monitors included representatives from the UN, EU, West African block Ecowas and US and French diplomats. The election in the west African nation is intended to replace a transitional parliament that has run the nation since military rule ended in 2010. The run-up to the election was hit by violence, as well as ethnic and religious tension. It has been much delayed and was supposed to be held six months after the 2010 presidential elections, which Mr Conde narrowly won. </body>

      <title>Police prevent Maldives election</title>
      <description>The Maldives is plunged into fresh political uncertainty as a re-run presidential election, set for Saturday, is cancelled at the last moment.</description>

      <body>Police in the Maldives have stopped a presidential election from going ahead on Saturday, plunging the country into fresh political uncertainty. Electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The latest move has caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process". A US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the failure to hold Saturday's election "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. In a televised speech, Mr Thowfeek said it was a "dark day for democracy". Correspondents said the Maldives' capital, Male, appeared calm early on Saturday, with people still waking up to the news. Mr Nasheed is standing in the election but the two candidates who trailed behind him in an earlier vote - held last month but then annulled - have been fighting for it not to take place. Late on Friday, Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they hadn't had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court didn't issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. Last week, the Maldives Supreme Court annulled the result of the first round of the elections held in September because of alleged irregularities. Mr Nasheed, now the main opposition leader in the Indian Ocean archipelago, won 45% in that poll against 5% for current President Mohamed Waheed. Mr Waheed has since withdrawn from the election. Analysts say that if his replacement is not elected by the end of his official term in three weeks, it will spark a constitutional crisis. Early on Saturday, Mr Thowfeek had announced: "We will hold the election in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Supreme Court. "The start of the voting may be delayed in some places, but we will allow more time for people to cast their ballots." However, within hours police were at the electoral commission and Mr Thowfeek was obliged to call the election off. "Police personnel in this building stopped us taking anything from here [election offices], so we have no other option except to stop the election today," he said. "A new date for elections will be informed later," he added. International observers had all praised the conduct of the first-round election, and the Supreme Court's decision to annul it was condemned by Mr Nasheed's supporters. Mr Nasheed came to power in 2008 in the Maldives' first free elections, but resigned amid violent protests and a mutiny by senior police officers in February 2012. </body>

      <body>American jazz star Patti Austin has cancelled a concert in Beijing after suffering "a severe asthma attack". A statement on the singer's website said Ms Austin was unable to perform at Forbidden City Concert Hall on Friday night "due to health problems". While the cause of her illness has not been confirmed, it comes at a time of growing concern over air pollution levels in the Chinese capital. The city has recently announced measures to combat worsening pollution. They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution. The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next. A statement on Patti Austin's website said: "She was taken in an emergency to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital this morning where she has been treated for a severe asthma attack in combination with respiratory infection. "Ms Austin is currently resting in her hotel. Her current breathing condition does not physically enable her to perform tonight. "Ms Austin is extremely disappointed about this situation since she was very much looking forward to performing." The new anti-pollution system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red. On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites. Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecues will be ordered to close temporarily, and fireworks will be banned throughout the city. When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed. The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial. Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force. Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates. </body>

      <body>A court in Milan has banned Silvio Berlusconi, Italy's former prime minister, from holding public office for two years, following his conviction for tax fraud. However, the ban must be approved by parliament before taking effect. Earlier this month, a cross-party panel of the Italian Senate recommended his expulsion from the chamber. Berlusconi had threatened to topple the coalition government over the issue but backed down during a confidence vote. If he is expelled from the senate, he will lose his parliamentary immunity from prosecution in a string of criminal cases. He will also spend a year under house arrest, or doing community service - his preferred option, according to a request he formally submitted last week. The votes on his expulsion and ban on holding office are expected to take place within the next few weeks. Berlusconi, 77, was convicted over deals his firm Mediaset made to purchase TV rights to US films. He was sentenced to four years in prison, automatically reduced to one under a 2006 pardon act. He was also banned from holding public office for five years. The sentence was upheld in August. </body>

      <title>Spain party treasurer 'sent cash'</title>
      <description>The ex-treasurer of Spain's ruling Popular Party Luis Barcenas tells a court he handed illegal cash to the party's secretary general, a claim she denies.</description>

      <body>The former treasurer of Spain's ruling Popular Party says he handed thousands of euros in slush fund payments to the party's secretary general. Speaking by video link from jail, Luis Barcenas said he had given two envelopes with 7,500 euros (£6,350; $10,300) to Maria Cospedal in 2008. Ms Cospedal - who is suing Mr Barcenas for defamation - denied the claim. Mr Barcenas is in custody pending trial over corruption claims. The scandal has rocked the party and angered Spaniards. The former treasurer was giving evidence to a court in Toledo on Friday. He claimed he had personally delivered the cash to Ms Cospedal. Mr Barcenas added that the slush fund payments were a PP tradition. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy earlier this year denied the claim. He also said allegations that he had personally received illegal payments were "lies and manipulations". The Barcenas affair sparked widespread anger in Spain, hit by a double-dip recession and high unemployment. In July, clashes erupted between anti-government protesters and police after more than 1,000 people gathered outside the PP headquarters in Madrid, calling on the government to resign. The scandal originated in a 2009 judicial investigation into corrupt payments involving PP members. In January this year, El Pais newspaper published an list it said showed illegal payments to party members that had been signed off by Mr Barcenas. The former party treasurer says he made numerous bonus cash payments to Mr Rajoy and other senior party members out of the slush fund of donations by businesses. In response, they have accused the ex-treasurer of trying to blackmail them. The PP was handed a clear mandate by Spanish voters at the end of 2011 and as a result Mr Rajoy and his party enjoy a clear majority in parliament. The corruption allegations coincide with Spain's worst economic crisis for decades, and have threatened to destabilise government attempts to shore up public finances and bring the recession to an end. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 35 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <title>Lebanese hostages in Syria 'freed'</title>

      <body>Nine Lebanese Shia pilgrims held hostage in Syria have been freed, Lebanon's interior minster has said. The pilgrims have crossed over into southern Turkey, and will arrive back in Lebanon soon, according to Interior Minister Marwan Charbel. The nine were part of a group of 11 who were seized while making their way back to Lebanon in May 2012 after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of the group were subsequently released. The pilgrims' release had been reported by Lebanese officials three days after they were seized, but it then transpired that they had not left Syria. "The story is over," Mr Charbel told the Reuters news agency. "In the next 24 hours, they will be with us [in Lebanon]." The Qatari foreign minister told the al-Jazeera television network on Friday that the pilgrims' release had now come about due to Qatari mediation. The news was greeted with jubilation in southern Beirut, where relatives of some of those kidnapped live, according to local media reports. In August a group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it was behind the kidnapping of two Turkish pilots in Beirut, saying they would be freed in exchange for the pilgrims. Mr Charbel said he now expected the two pilots, Murat Akpinar and co-pilot Murat Agca, to be released soon, according to Reuters. "We insist that those who kidnapped the Turks release them,'" he said, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu was also quoted as saying he expected a resolution to their case soon. "Very positive developments are under way in the case of the pilots; this matter has largely been settled," Mr Davutoglu said on Turkish television, according to AFP. Earlier this week the two appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. There are also expectations that a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government might be released as part of an elaborate three-way deal. </body>

      <body>Two convicted murderers freed from prison with forged paperwork dutifully went to a jail to register as felons several days after their release. Florida officials are searching for Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, who were serving life sentences. Prison officials said they will tighten up their early-release policy to ensure there is no repeat of the blunder. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after first convict's release. It is not clear who made the bogus release documents, or if the escapes were related. Jenkins walked free on 27 September and registered three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker was set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The two prisoners apparently signed on to keep up the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. A deputy at the jail verifies that felons do not have any outstanding warrants, according to jail spokesman Allen Moore. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge were processed through standard channels this autumn, officials have said. Authorities received release orders bearing the faked signature of Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry, printed on Ninth Judicial Circuit letterhead. The fabricated documents were processed by the Orange County clerk's office and sent to the Department of Corrections, which co-ordinated the inmates' release from Franklin prison in the city of Carrabelle, in the north of the state. Sheriff's office spokesman Angelo Nieves told reporters: "This shouldn't have happened, but it did, and our concern is to get these individuals into custody." Judge Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department, notably, how rare it is for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons will now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates had been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 shooting death of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting death of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <body>New powers to crack down on modern slavery are to be introduced in a bid to end the trafficking of hundreds of men, women and children to the UK every year. One measure includes the introduction of a maximum life sentence for the worst cases of exploitation. At present the conviction rate is one of the lowest in Europe, according to the Human Trafficking Foundation. The BBC has spoken to Adriana, whose name has been changed to protect her identity. She was orphaned at 17, and forced into a violent marriage when another man promised her a better life in the UK. She told the BBC's Sophie Long how she accepted but on arrival was raped, imprisoned and kept as a sex slave. </body>

      <body>It is 50 years since John F Kennedy was assassinated. Where were you when you heard the news? Kennedy was sworn in as president in 1961. At 43 he was the country's youngest president and presented himself as a youthful figure for a new generation. On November 22, 1963, Kennedy and his wife Jacqueline were riding slowly in a motorcade through Dallas. At 12:30 the president was hit in the head and throat when three shots were fired at his open-topped car. He was pronounced dead shortly after arrival at Parkland Memorial Hospital. According to the Warren Commission established to investigate the assassination, a lone gunman - Lee Harvey Oswald - killed the president. There has been consistent speculation ever since that Kennedy's death was the result of a conspiracy. The news shocked the nation and the world. British-American journalist Alistair Cooke said he could not remember a time in the previous 30 years when people everywhere were "so quiet, so tired looking" and "so plainly the victims of a huge and bitter disappointment". In his Letter from America, Cooke recalled the promise of the youthful president, saying there was "the sense that we've been cheated… of the promise of what we had begun to call the age of Kennedy". Can you remember where you were when you heard the news? Have you got any photos from the day or did you ever meet the president? Wherever you are in the world, we want to hear your story.

      <title>Stage revival of film giant Laughton</title>
      <description>The Thick of It star on spin doctors and screen legends</description>

      <body>He made his name as an insufferable spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It and a plain-speaking manager in the BBC's Twenty Twelve. Now actor Vincent Franklin is on stage portraying one of Britain's greatest film stars, Charles Laughton. The legend of Charles Laughton has faded in the 50 years since his death, but the actor was among Britain's first Hollywood superstars, a giant of the silver screen from the 1930s onwards. Whether playing Henry VIII - a role that won him an Oscar in 1934 - or Rembrandt, Captain Bligh or Quasimodo, he was regarded by many as the greatest character actor of his age. "I certainly felt very excited about the idea of playing Laughton when I was asked to do it," explains Vincent Franklin. "Then within a week of being asked, when I'd started to read some books, I thought, this is the most arrogant thing I've ever agreed to do. "If somebody said to an actor, 'Do you want to play Laurence Olivier? Do you want to play Gielgud? Do you want to play De Niro?' you'd go, 'No I'm not going to play De Niro. Unless you're as good as De Niro how can you possibly play De Niro?' "But somehow I'd foolishly gone, 'Yeah, I'll play Charles Laughton.'" Laughton was born in the Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough and it is in the actor's home town that Franklin is bringing the Laughton legend back to life. A private and insecure person, Laughton never gave interviews. In the play, Franklin attempts to peel back the screen persona to reveal the real man. "He was an extraordinary lost soul," Franklin says. "As a fat, bald, northern actor myself, the idea that you can be an actor is fine. "But the idea that a man who is by his own [admission] an ugly man can become a film star is quite extraordinary. "On the surface of it, he's an extraordinary, successful human being. But on the inside it's a man who struggled with his own religious beliefs, struggled with his sexuality and struggled with self-loathing while at the same time being a true artist." The play, titled Laughton, is at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre, which was run by Alan Ayckbourn for 37 years. On display in the foyer is a photograph of Laughton, the guest of honour when the building was opened as a cinema in 1936. Franklin, from Bradford, was most recently seen playing Labour whip Michael Cocks in the National Theatre's 1970s political drama This House. But he is most recognisable from his TV roles as the no-nonsense head of contracts Nick Jowett in Olympic spoof Twenty Twelve and the all-nonsense Conservative PR guru Stewart Pearson in The Thick of It. The insufferably smug Pearson likes nothing better than to "imagineer the narrative" or "take a few turns on the ideas carousel". The Thick of It looks to be on indefinite recess now that Peter Capaldi, who played Pearson's expletive-slinging nemesis Malcolm Tucker, has been cast as Doctor Who. Writer Armando Iannucci recently said the show "has quietly been put in its box". "There's room for some specials," Franklin believes. "Whether Malcolm Tucker will be able to come back from Alpha Centauri or wherever he's been taken in the Tardis I don't know, but I hope so. "I regularly meet some people from it and there is a real sense of, 'It would be nice to do one more, wouldn't it?'" Unusually for an actor, Franklin also has a real job - a decade ago, he founded a company called Quietroom, which advises companies and government departments on how to communicate clearly. In that capacity, he is the anti-Stewart Pearson. "We improvise quite a lot of The Thick of It and quite a lot of what I do is the exact opposite of what I would tell someone to do [at Quietroom]," he says. For someone who advises people how to communicate, Franklin is suitably conscious of his choice of words as an interviewee. At one point he warns, "I'm just going to ramble for a moment now" and regularly checks: "Does that make sense?" When Quietroom works for the government, there are some startled reactions when Franklin pops up in Whitehall between acting jobs, he says. "Between the last government and this one, I went in to do an audit of the language the Treasury was using in things like the Budget and their website," the actor says. "I had my Stewart Pearson beard on - because that's my beard - and I do get very strange looks from people walking around the Treasury or HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] from people going, 'Satan lives!' "What's great about this show is that its biggest fans are people who work in government. Real MPs do want to come and have their picture taken with you, which always seems really bizarre to me." Back in Scarborough, Franklin praises Laughton's writer, the author and geologist Roger Osborne, for his use of language. "So much of what we do in life is about reading stuff and understanding what lies behind it," he says. "Does that make sense? Whether that's us buying an insurance project or playing Charles Laughton. So choosing the right words is really important." Laughton is at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough until 26 October. </body>

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>The joint Nobel winners who fundamentally disagree</description>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is rule for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>The secrets revealed by babies' laughter</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance comes as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>Going nuclear: UK's deal with China</title>
      <description>Should UK worry about China nuclear investment?</description>

      <body>Perched high on top of one of the giant new reactor buildings under construction at Taishan we had a view over the entire site. It's one of the biggest nuclear plants of its kind in the world: six reactors being built on the edge of the South China Sea. In front of us construction cranes encircled the egg-like shape of another huge, grey concrete reactor shell. They swung lazily back and forth. Teams of workers were welding metal bars in place. Everything looked incredibly orderly. George Osborne, the UK chancellor, looked impressed. Mr Osborne had just announced that he will welcome Chinese participation in building nuclear power stations in Britain. Mr Osborne's host, Zhang Shan Ming, the general manager of the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGN), obviously keen to stress the safety features of the reactor, was explaining why the concrete casing was so thick. "It's against air traffic crash," Mr Zhang said. "Right," the UK chancellor replied. "Special safety procedures." "An earthquake, or tsunami, or typhoon, you are prepared for that?" Mr Osborne asked. "The design is prepared for this," he was told. Britain's chancellor seemed reassured, as he needs to be, given that a near replica of Taishan is now likely to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset in the UK at a cost of around £14 billion ($22bn) by a similar consortium to that working in China. Taishan uses European-designed reactors built by a partnership between the French firm EDF and China's CGN. It's one of almost 30 new nuclear power plants China is building or planning to build. China has not had any major accidents at its nuclear power stations, and says its safety record is good. But there are concerns that, in the dash to build so many new reactors, and use indigenous Chinese technology in some, safety could be compromised. Just down the coast from Taishan lies Hong Kong, where environmental groups enjoy far more freedom than they would have in China. They say there are reasons the UK should be cautious about partnering with China's nuclear operators. "My first concern would be the lack of transparency," says Prentice Koo, senior campaigner at Greenpeace. "Their track record is really bad. For every incident in a nuclear power plant in China, they only provide a very brief report, and all it says is how they solved the problem," he says. "They never give the reason for the incident." His second concern is whether Chinese companies would actually pay up if they were found liable for any incident that happened to a reactor they had built overseas. "The nuclear industry in China enjoys such a privileged position that they have to pay only very limited sums in compensation if there is any major incident," explains Mr Koo. "Overseas they'll be required to pay a lot more... it'll test the ability of China's nuclear industry to pay up." At Taishan, though, they were keen to point out not only their safety features, but also how transparent they are. Dong Shi Ming, a public relations officer, said it was so open that members of the public could come and visit the site - all they had to do was apply for an organised tour. He claimed thousands had already done so. Is China's nuclear industry safe or not? Is it really transparent? They're important questions. Involvement in the UK will test China's firms. It may even force them to be more transparent. The only other place where China has built reactors so far is in Pakistan. Some in the West will be deeply uncomfortable at the prospect of Chinese state-owned firms being involved in the building and running of UK nuclear plants. After all, China remains an authoritarian state, its nuclear firms answerable, ultimately to the Communist Party. For now they are to be minority players in the UK. But one day they may have control over some of Britain's strategic energy supplies. Others, like George Osborne, see a great opportunity. As one member of the British delegation explained to me, deeper commercial engagement will give China a bigger stake in Britain's success. Britain's goodwill in opening up to Chinese firms could engender better ties and reciprocal opportunities for British firms in China's nuclear industry. The UK is already a major investor in China through oil firms like Shell and BP. Getting China to invest more in the UK makes the relationship more balanced, the argument goes. China now has stakes in Britain's oil and gas industries; nuclear opens a major new area to it. Some of this boils down to long-running arguments: Is it better to engage China or to be cautious? Is it wise to draw it into a deeper relationship with the outside world or be wary of the intentions of its opaque Communist rulers?

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up?</title>
      <description>Is China's economic growth as breakneck as figures suggest?</description>

      <body>China's economy sped up in the July-to-September quarter to expand at 7.8% year-on-year, according to official gross domestic product (GDP) figures. That's faster than the previous quarter when GDP grew at 7.5% and the January-to March quarter's 7.7% expansion. Unless the fourth quarter tanks, it means that the Chinese government will hit its growth target of 7.5% for the year, as the growth rate for the first nine months came in at 7.7%. If they were to hit the target, it would be the slowest growth rate since 1999 which was the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis. The Chinese government is aiming for a slower and better balanced economy that can grow more sustainably. But, one thing that hasn't changed is that there are more questions than ever over the reliability of Chinese figures. It's not just GDP, but the other data releases today have also come in largely as expected: industrial production rising 10.2% from a year earlier in September, retail sales up 13.3%, fixed asset investment grew by 20.2%. I've written about the trouble with Chinese figures before, particularly when it comes to GDP. But, how good are the three indicators reportedly espoused by China's premier Li Keqiang as being more reliable? They are gaining prominence as they are being used by banks such as Credit Suisse and JPMorgan as an alternative index for Chinese growth. The first indicator is electricity usage. The amount of power used by households and firms is a good gauge of consumption and one that is hard to hide. One problem is that China subsidizes some prices so it's somewhat mis-measured, but it's a decent economic indicator. Credit Suisse estimates it's around 9% annualised growth. The amount of cargo freight is the second measure. Instead of factories saying how much they've produced (recall that they have been chastised for faking figures in Yunnan and Guangdong provinces this year), it's more reliable to take a look ourselves. Railway cargo volume shows how much has been manufactured and is being moved around the country. But it is an under-measurement of economic activity because it only captures around 40% of GDP - the biggest part of the Chinese economy now is services. Cargo freight volumes are growing at around 21%. The final gauge is bank loans. How much households and firms borrow over the medium and long-term reflects the amount of demand in the economy for investment. This is why it's a good indicator of economic activity. But if this is used unproductively to build ghost cities, then it's a different way of over-stating growth. These loans are growing at about 5%. It's not just Western banks that look at this data. I understand from Chinese government researchers that a rule of thumb is if the Li Keqiang indicators show about 10-11% growth, then real GDP growth would be around 7-8%. In which case, today's GDP figure would be consistent with the Li Keqiang index and show that the Chinese economy is speeding up. But, there are others who are convinced that Chinese officials won't miss (bar an external crisis that can be blamed) a growth target, so none of these government-produced figures are very reliable. Plus, none of these indicators, even viewed together, would be able to give a complete picture. One thing is clear is that this debate is sure to run and run. For the Chinese leadership who are keen to show that they're cracking down on fraudulent data and increasing confidence in the economy, it would help if they could indicate why they are well-equipped to produce GDP figures faster than any other major economy in the world. Doing so in just over 2 weeks is a fairly remarkable feat for any country, much less one with 1.3 billion people. That's a lot of data to process in a rather short period of time. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>Ship trackers 'vulnerable to hacks'</title>
      <description>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacks and exploitation, security experts warn.</description>

      <body>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacking, security experts have warned. Weaknesses in outdated systems could allow attackers to make ships disappear from tracking systems - or even make it look like a large fleet was incoming. Researchers at Trend Micro said their findings showed the danger of using legacy systems designed when security was not an issue. But one vessel-tracking specialist said spoof attempts could be easily spotted. Lloyd's List Intelligence's Ian Trowbridge said that in addition to the vulnerable technology - known as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) - other measures could be used to identify marine activity. "The spoofing would immediately be identified by [Lloyd's List Intelligence] as a warp vessel," he said, "providing unexplained position reports outside of the vessel's speed/distance capability and thus subject to further investigation and validation." The AIS system is used to track the whereabouts of ships travelling across the world's oceans. For ships over a certain size, having AIS fitted is mandatory under international maritime law. It is designed to transmit data about a ship's position, as well as other relevant information, so that movements can be seen by other boats as well as relevant authorities on shore. One other use is to alert nearby ships when a man or woman is overboard - an alert that can easily be spoofed, says Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson. "It boils down to the fact that the protocol was never designed with security in mind," he told the BBC. "There's no validity checking of what's being put up there." Using equipment bought for 700 euros (£600), the researchers were able to intercept signals and make vessels appear on the tracking system, even though they did not exist. In one example, the team was able to make it look as if a ship's route had spelled out the word "pwned" - hacker slang for "owned". The information broadcast by AIS is public - but when the system was first put in use, in the early 1990s, the technology required to receive the information was prohibitively expensive for those not directly involved in the industry. But now, a typical internet connection can be used to see the locations of boats, as well as an indicator of what type of cargo they may be carrying. There has been speculation that Somali pirates have been making use of the system. "It has long been thought that the pirates are basically using AIS as a shopping list," Mr Ferguson said, "seeing what's coming into local waters, and what cargo it may have." However, Lloyd's List Intelligence noted that captains are permitted to disable AIS if they feel their crew could be endangered by it. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>LED 'li-fi' step closer, says China</title>
      <description>Chinese scientists say they are closer to achieving wireless internet connectivity through light bulbs, rather than traditional radio frequencies.</description>

      <body>Wi-fi connectivity from a light bulb - or "li-fi" - has come a step closer, according to Chinese scientists. A microchipped bulb can produce data speeds of up to 150 megabits per second (Mbps), Chi Nan, IT professor at Shanghai's Fudan University told Xinhua News. A one-watt LED light bulb would be enough to provide net connectivity to four computers, researchers say. But experts told the BBC more evidence was needed to back up the claims. There are no supporting video or photos showing the technology in action. Li-fi, also known as visible light communications (VLC), at these speeds would be faster - and cheaper - than the average Chinese broadband connection. In 2011, Prof Harald Haas, an expert in optical wireless communications at the University of Edinburgh, demonstrated how an LED bulb equipped with signal processing technology could stream a high-definition video to a computer. He coined the term "light fidelity" or li-fi and set up a private company, PureVLC, to exploit the technology. "We're just as surprised as everyone else by this announcement," PureVLC spokesman Nikola Serafimovski told the BBC. "But how valid this is we don't know without seeing more evidence. We remain sceptical." This year, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute claimed that data rates of up to 1Gbit/s per LED light frequency were possible in laboratory conditions, making one bulb with three colours potentially capable of transmitting data at up to 3Gbit/s. Li-fi promises to be cheaper and more energy-efficient than existing wireless radio systems given the ubiquity of LED bulbs and the fact that lighting infrastructure is already in place. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and 10,000 times bigger than the radio spectrum, affording potentially unlimited capacity. But there are drawbacks: block the light and you block the signal. However, this is also a potential advantage from a security point of view. Light cannot penetrate walls as radio signals can, so drive-by hacking of wireless internet signals would be far more difficult, if not impossible. Prof Chi's research team includes scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the report says. She admitted that the technology was still in its infancy and needed further developments in microchip design and optical communication controls before it could go mass market. Her team is hoping to show off sample li-fi kits at the China International Industry Fair in Shanghai on 5 November, the report said. </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>Windows 8.1 gets global release</title>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has insisted he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled to Moscow from Hong Kong in June. He told the New York Times he had given all the papers to journalists in Hong Kong and had kept no copies. Mr Snowden, who worked for two US spy agencies, also said no confidential information had been passed to China. The US authorities want Mr Snowden extradited to face trial, but Russia has refused to hand him over. The Russian authorities gave him a one-year visa earlier this year after he claimed asylum. Mr Snowden told the US newspaper that he did not take any of the documents because it would not have been in the public interest. "What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward," he said. Claims had surfaced in media reports that China was likely to have gained some intelligence from the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor before he left Hong Kong. Some analysts had suggested he was working with Chinese intelligence, while others said he was working with the Russians. But Mr Snowden rebuffed these claims, saying: "There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents." He said his last job for the NSA had focused on China, and he had "access to every target", so he felt confident that the data was safe from Chinese agencies. The New York Times report said its interview was conducted over several days via encrypted networks. The information leaked by Mr Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale of governments, businesses and members of the public. Targets have included rivals like China and Russia, as well as close allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. </body>

      <title>Adidas smartwatch has pulse sensor</title>
      <description>Adidas announces a touchscreen colour watch that can measure its owner's heart-rate to create tailored training programmes.</description>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas. The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings. It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps. The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker. The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products. At $399 (£350 in the UK) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth. It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone. The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company. Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco. It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down. The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches. The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality. Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode". Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own. Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018. However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices. "The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas. "We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can acts as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app. "There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded." Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month. </body>

      <title>EE rapped over 'misleading' maps</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority asks for changes to EE's mobile coverage checker following a complaint about its accuracy.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area. The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said. The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps. Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street. It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area. Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleading Its ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode." In response EE said: "The Coverage Checker offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal." "We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added. EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract. O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected. "Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement. "We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis." Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017. But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected. There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal. Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors. "Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added. </body>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is 6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <body>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots of security holes in the software. The update fixes 51 separate security bugs in Java, which owner Oracle says is used on billions of devices. About a dozen of the bugs were serious enough to allow attackers to take remote control of a compromised system, researchers said. Java is one of the most popular targets for cyber-thieves and malware writers seeking to hijack home computers. In its advisory about the update, Oracle urged customers to patch the software as soon as possible "due to the threat posed by a successful attack". Programming language Java has proved popular because software written with it can easily be made to run on many different types of computer. Twelve of the holes in Java addressed by the update topped the table that ranked the severity of security weaknesses in software, wrote Qualys security expert Wolfgang Kandek in a blogpost. If these bugs were exploited, attackers could bypass ID controls and take over a target system, he added. He said those seeking to exploit Java would probably seed web pages with booby-trapped links in a bid to catch vulnerable machines. Security glitches in Java are favourites among those that write and run so-called "exploit kits" that seek to compromise vulnerable websites and other systems. Security blogger Brian Krebs said if people needed to run Java, it was well worth taking time to apply the update. Those that did not need the software should consider disabling it altogether, he said. "This widely installed and powerful program is riddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants," he wrote. The update is available via the main Java website and has prompted follow-up action from other electronics firms. Apple has released an update to the version of Java that runs on its computers. This update points people towards the official version of Java from Oracle instead of that supplied by Apple. In the past, Apple has faced criticism over the speed with which it updated its version of Java. </body>

      <title>Watch Dogs delay wounds games maker</title>
      <description>More than a quarter of Ubisoft's market value is wiped out after the French video games publisher delays the launch of hacker-themed title Watch Dogs.</description>

      <body>Shares in video games firm Ubisoft have slumped by 26% after it delayed the release of two much-anticipated titles. Hacker-themed Watch Dogs and open-world racing game The Crew have both been postponed until the publisher's next financial year, which begins in April. The company said it wanted to allow its developers to fine tune their work. Watch Dogs had been due to go on sale on 19 November and will miss out on being a launch title for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Retailers, including Amazon and Gamestop, have assured consumers who had pre-ordered bundles including both the Chicago-based title and one of the games consoles that they will still receive the machine on the day they had been quoted. The Crew had originally been due out some time in the first three months of 2014. France-based Ubisoft has had success with its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance and Splinter Cell franchises. However, it warned that the delays meant it was likely to swing to an operating loss when it declares its full-year results. Chief executive Yves Guillemo called the move a "tough decision". "We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance," he added. "In a context of growing successes for mega-blockbusters, the additional time given to the development of our titles will allow them to fulfil their huge ambitions and thus offer players even more exceptional experiences." A blog posted by the Watch Dogs development team added that it planned to launch the game before the end of June. "As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," it stated. Ubisoft added that The Crew would now go on sale before the end of September. The news caught many analysts by surprise. To make its November debut, the "gold master" version of Watch Dogs' code would have needed to have been finalised soon in order for the discs to be manufactured and shipped to stores in time. It is unusual, though not unknown, for a game to be pulled so late in development. In February, Ubisoft delayed its platformer Rayman Legends by half a year, less than a month before it had been due to go on sale. Perhaps the best known example was Valve's announcement in 2003 that its sci-fi action sequel Half-Life 2 was to be delayed, just a week before its scheduled launch date. It went on to become one of the best reviewed games of all time. One industry watcher said a short-term view by investors had caused the firm's stock to dive, but that Ubisoft was better off doing this than releasing Watch Dogs in a state that required later software patches to address major faults. "I think it was going to be one of the drivers for initial games-console bundle sales and will probably push back some of the hardware sales that would have happened right out of the gate for Sony and Microsoft," said Lewis Ward, video games research manager at consultants IDC. "But absolutely it's the right decision if there's something glitchy or there's some game-balance factor that is off. "There's a lot of interconnections between the things you can control in the game and how the story then unfolds, so I can only assume there's some factor with the incredibly complex open-world gameplay that's off. "But there's no reason Ubisoft can't still deliver what they hoped to do with this game." </body>

      <title>Samsung offers to end patent wars</title>
      <description>To avoid a huge fine for allegations that it has abused the patent system, Samsung has waved the white flag on patent wars.</description>

      <body>Samsung has said that it will stop taking rivals to court over certain patent infringements for the next five years. The white flag in the patent battle has been raised because the South Korean electronics firm faces a huge fine for alleged abuses of the system. The move could help end a long-running patent war between the world's largest mobile makers. The EU said that a resolution would bring "clarity to the industry". "Samsung has offered to abstain from seeking injunctions for mobile SEPs (standard essential patents) for a period of five years against any company that agrees to a particular licensing framework," the European Commission said in a statement. Standard essential patents refer to inventions recognised as being critical to implementing an industry standard technology. Examples of such technologies include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a cellular standard at the heart of 3G data; and H.264, a video compression format used by YouTube, Blu-ray disks and Adobe Flash Player among others. The EU had accused the Samsung of stifling competition by bringing a series of SEP lawsuits against Apple and other rivals. Google's Motorola Mobility has been charged with similar anti-competitive practice. Samsung faced a $18.3bn (£11.3bn) fine if it was found guilty of breaching anti-trust laws. "Enforcing patents through injunctions can be perfectly legitimate, said Joaquin Almunia, the European Commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy. "However, when patents are standard-essential, abuses must be prevented so that standard-setting works properly and consumers do not have to suffer negative consequences from the so-called patent wars. "If we reach a good solution in this case, it will bring clarity to the industry," he added. Samsung and Apple are currently battling each other in courts in more than 10 countries across Europe. Interested parties have been given a month to comment on the proposals. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>
      <description>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion reactors.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24528306</url>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes. The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again. The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London. The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016. One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions. "Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC. "But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed." ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper. "For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell. The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales. It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum. Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s. Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair. "One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell. "So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software. "We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine." </body>

      <body>Argos is to launch its own tablet computer ahead of Christmas - following in the steps of Tesco, Samsung, Amazon and Apple. The MyTablet, which costs £99.99, is aimed primarily at eight to 13-year-olds and comes with parental controls already in place. Joanne Savage, Argos head of Own Brand, told BBC Radio 5 live's Wake Up to Money: "It's targeted at the tween market." "They tired of giving their tablet back to their mum and dad... they want their tablet for them, hence we're launching the MyTablet." </body>

      <body>Nina and Georgi Tushev's tiny loft in New York City is full of homemade drones. Mr Tushev builds them from scratch and puts a tiny camera on top. When he pilots his drones, he wears goggles that receive the video signal directly from the plane. He can see in real time what the drone sees. "That's how I fly", he says. Authorities are still trying to figure out how to regulate the new technology. In the meantime the growing number of amateur enthusiasts in the US and around the world are pushing boundaries about what and where they fly. Produced by the BBC's Anna Bressanin.

      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24543910</url>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones. Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him. Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said. An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement. Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones. On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic. Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones. Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes. And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310). Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones. At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12. Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty. "Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'" "It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America." Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said. Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems. "Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical. Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless. Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head. Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog. Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous". But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen." Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor. As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building. Now he said: "I just step back." </body>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <title>7 reasons why Buzzfeed is the death/saviour of news</title>
      <description>Rory's 7 reasons why you cannot ignore Buzzfeed</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24532004</url>
      <date>1381823426</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70483000/jpg/_70483141_untitled-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>The social news site Buzzfeed is growing at a scary rate, racing past serious news services like the New York Times - and the BBC - as the way younger people hear about what's happening around the world. It's even announced that it will be launching French, Spanish and Portuguese editions, using students and a language teaching platform called Duolingo to translate stories. So, in the spirit of a Buzzfeed list here are seven reasons why we should love/hate it: With 85 million visitors in August, it is fast becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. And look at where more than a billion Facebook users get their news - Buzzfeed is top of the list when it comes to stories shared by users, ahead of the Huffington Post, CNN and the BBC. And as the founder Jonah Peretti put it in a memo to staff, it's reaching an important audience: "The world needs sustainable, profitable, vibrant content companies staffed by dedicated professionals; especially content for people that grew up on the web, whose entertainment and news interests are largely neglected by television and newspapers." "This Baby Elephant Being Reunited With His Dad is The Cutest Thing You'll See Today" and "9 celebrity tweets you missed today" - if that is the future of journalism, heaven help us all… Some other Buzzfeed headlines today: "The Big Winner in JP Morgan's Earnings - lawyers", "Why These Three Economists Won The Nobel Prize", and "Blackberry's Last Ditch Attempt To Win You Over is Pretty Hilarious". There's business, technology and politics on Buzzfeed, and it's recruiting some serious journalist talent in the US and in London. When I met Jonah Peretti earlier this year and suggested that the cute and silly stuff was just part of a long term plan to fund serious investigative journalism he laughed. "You don't get it," he said. "We love the funny stories - it's what we're about." And some of the daft stuff is brilliantly done. Look at "The 29 Stages of A Twitterstorm." But serious or silly, it is all about clicks - any Buzzfeed writers who can't build an audience for their stories will soon be heading for the exit. The hardest trick in the modern media is making online news profitable - just ask anyone from The Guardian to The Sun. But as well as employing more than 400 people - technologists, journalists, marketing types - Buzzfeed is, according to Jonah Peretti, now making money. It was "accidentally" profitable once before in 2011, and then spent lots on expansion. Now it looks well placed to become a media powerhouse and without loads of intrusive advertising… Buzzfeed's clever trick is to teach advertisers to write Buzzfeed-like stories which promote their brands without in-your-face messages. On this morning's Today programme Jonah Peretti insisted that there was a clear division between "church and state", advertising and content. That may not be anything like as clear to Buzzfeed readers who click on "13 Signs You're Addicted To Fashion Blogs" without noticing that is sponsored by Blackberry UK. Mind you, whether that does any good to Blackberry is another matter entirely… 7. And here's a cute picture of a dog with a bandaged paw….. Well, if you can't beat them….. </body>

      <title>Why tech giants are investing in Africa</title>
      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?" The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting. He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened. It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence. In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend. So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story? Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent. The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October. According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent. "The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa. "We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security. "As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future. "And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here. "We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment." His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York. "People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere. "But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem." Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce. The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform. Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war. "We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology. "Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara. "It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing. "It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills. "[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology." But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative. "There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space. "This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development. "In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa. "Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant." Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant. She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International. The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering. The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi. "We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says. "And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years." One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab. Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production. </body>

      <title>The strange life of John McAfee</title>
      <description>The very strange life of millionaire John McAfee</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24441931</url>

      <body>Who is the real John McAfee? He's the man who went on the run after his neighbour was found dead, face-up, with a bullet in his head. He's the man who jump-started the multibillion-dollar anti-virus industry. And now he thinks he can make you invisible on the internet. Within tech circles he's long been a legend. But for most people, McAfee came to prominence last year when he fled his Central American home - teeth stained, hair dyed, in disguise - rather than let himself be questioned by authorities he accused of being corrupt. He tells the BBC he had "no connection whatsoever" with his neighbour's death. Police say he remains a "person of interest". Back in the US, after posting footage of young female "friends" stroking his naked tattooed torso, he now plans to neutralise the NSA's cyber-surveillance system. It might suggest a crazed, perhaps even deranged, personality. One journalist who has interviewed McAfee many times described him a "master manipulator" who lies and deceives. "I've been called paranoid, schizophrenic, the wild child of Silicon Valley," McAfee acknowledges. But he has a different perspective: "I'm an entrepreneur. I always have been. I am curious and I enjoy solving problems. "I think that it's when we step out of the road, step outside the box, become our own person and we walk fearlessly down paths other people wouldn't look at, that true progress comes. And sometimes true beauty as well. "We're missing that. We're missing the people who have the courage to walk into the wilderness just to see what's there." This is how Amy Emshwiller, the teenage ex-prostitute he lived with in Belize, describes him: "He's sweet, generous. He likes to like adventures. He's serious and usually he has a dark sense of humour. He's generally a sweet guy. He just doesn't like to be [expletive] with." So, who is the real John McAfee? To have any chance of knowing and gaining an informed opinion of what really motivated his erratic-sounding behaviour after the killing of Gregory Faull, you must travel deep into the 68-year-old's past. Despite his Southern accent, the bleached-blond and goateed businessman is in fact half-British - the son of an Englishwoman who met an American soldier stationed in the UK during World War II. "I feel as much British as I do American," McAfee says. "There's not much difference between our countries." They moved to Virginia when he was young, where he had a troubled childhood. His father was an abusive alcoholic who, when McAfee was aged 15, shot himself dead. In the following years, McAfee says, he too began drinking heavily and taking drugs, but still managed to maintain a promising academic career. That came to an end in the late 1960s when Northeast State Louisiana State College terminated his PhD in mathematics after it was revealed that he had slept with an undergraduate he was mentoring. They later married and McAfee turned his skills to a series of programming jobs with some of the biggest tech organisations of the time including Nasa, General Electric, Siemens, Univac and Xerox, all the while continuing to indulge in his addictions. "Most of my bosses also used drugs of some kind," he says. "I was in the tech field, after all, we were the leading edge in technology and the leading age in personal experimentation. "I had to hide it from my mother and sometimes from my wife. But in the work environment - depending on where you worked - in some companies drugs were taken openly at lunchtime in people's offices. It was a bizarre time." Matters came to a head in the early 1980s after his wife left him, his most recent employer, Omex, let him go and the scale of his drug dependency forced him to seek help. "It was 1984, the last time that I took drugs, drank alcohol or sold drugs for that matter," he says. "I simply stopped. I started going to an organisation called Alcoholics Anonymous... and that was my last taste of that world. "However, it is still with me. My body is covered with tattoos from that period. And I'm afraid some of my ideas and concepts and attitudes that were moulded during that time are still with me. That's why people think, perhaps, I'm a little bit off the wall." Despite his troubles, McAfee managed to land a job at defence contractor Lockheed Martin, where he worked on a classified voice-recognition program. There he came across an unusual bit of self-replicating code designed to copy itself on to any floppy disk inserted into affected computers. When examined, it contained the message: "Welcome to the dungeon. Beware of this VIRUS." "When I first read about the Pakistani Brain virus, I'd never heard of a virus before, neither had anyone in technology," remembers McAfee. "It fascinated me." He worked out a way to disinfect the computers and then spread the cure via the bulletin board system, a precursor to the web. The challenge inspired him to set up a business of his own: McAfee Associates - a firm that would later be sold, years after he had left, to Intel for more than $7.6bn (£4.7bn). "I knew the field would become extremely large because people being who they are, there will always be hackers," he says. "It's why we have graffiti on the walls of the inner city. People like to deface things. They like to disrupt things. "So, given that fact, computer viruses were not going to go away and were only going to get worse. I just did what I could to be at the forefront of that industry for as long as I could." Despite this, he says, he has never himself used any of the products made by the firm that continues to bear his name. "I'm constantly under attack, yet I use no software protection. "I protect myself by constantly changing my IP [internet protocol] address, by not attaching my name to any device I use, and by not going on to sites where you might pick up a virus. "Porn sites, for example, I just don't go there. "Secondly, I practise safe computing. If someone sends me an email with a link, I'm not going there until I can call the person to verify that they sent me the email. "It sounds absurd to live that way, but I would rather trust my own devices and thoughts than someone else's software." After selling his stake in the business in 1994, McAfee went on to found and sell other companies, including an instant messaging system, a firewall provider and a ranch from which he offered flights in "trikes" - low-flying, engine-powered cabins suspended from hang-gliders. Then he headed south. In 2008, at an age others might be thinking of putting up their feet, McAfee moved to the jungle of Belize with the stated intention of trying to cure another kind of infection. "I came across a concept called quorum sensing, which is the technique that bacteria use to communicate with each other. "Up until about 10 years ago we didn't even know that bacteria did communicate, but we find out they have a very sophisticated communication system. I wanted to explore and investigate that to see if we could come up with new antibiotics." He picked the area, he says, because the plants that grew along the country's Rio Nuevo river contained compounds that inhibit bacteria from sending chemical signals to each other and thus thwart their ability to co-ordinate an attack. Things didn't go as planned. The first sign of trouble was when journalists invited to his Carmelita, Orange Walk, base wrote stories that made clear they did not know what to make of the operation. Then a falling-out with the microbiologist he was working with, Allison Adonizio, put the project at risk when she quit. Dr Adonizio, who is now based in Philadelphia, did not want to be interviewed. In April 2012, matters came to a head when the Belize police force's Gang Suppression Unit raided the research facility. McAfee says the officers claimed they suspected it was being used to make the illegal psycho-stimulant methamphetamine. They shot his dog, he says, confiscated both his passport and licensed weapons on the property, and briefly imprisoned him before dropping the charges. "Under no circumstances did they really believe it was a meth lab," he states. "Everybody knew it was a biotech lab because I had hired half of the people in the village to work there. They all knew what I was doing. "It's a pirate haven. It's an extremely corrupt and dangerous place. "I knew this and my friends all advised me against it. I just thought I was smart enough to sidestep it. Unfortunately, I was not. "I was there for a year and the local politician sent a representative and asked for $2m for a campaign donation. I said no. Two weeks later they raided my compound." McAfee says when he was asked a second time for the cash he went on a publicity blitz, posting messages online, and speaking to local and international press about the incident. It became political. The Belize Times - published by the leading opposition party - suggested the "barbaric assault" on McAfee was a "global black eye" for the nation and a threat to its tourist industry. "I do wish that I were smarter socially," reflects McAfee. "I think I have the ability to solve mathematical equations and programming issues very easily, but I am a little bit naive in some social situations. And certainly in Belize I was way naive." At the time of the raid, McAfee had begun an affair with a 16-year-old ex-prostitute he had met on Belize Independence Day. "I was partying, I was drinking, and I went into this bar and the owner said a friend wants to meet me and likes me," remembers Amy Emshwiller, who still lives in Belize. "[He said] can I have your number, and then two weeks later he called me." She says he was unaware she was less than a quarter of his age. "He didn't know how old I was. I lied to him saying I was 18, and he thought it was OK. "I let him fall in love first before I told him my age. "When I told him he was so [expletive] shocked that he didn't know what to do. He was baffled. And he was like: 'I still love you, I don't know what to do. I'm in love with a young girl.' That's how that happened." McAfee's long-term American girlfriend left him. And like many things in his life, the new affair proved complicated. One night Emshwiller took McAfee's gun. She aimed it at his head, squeezed her eyes shut and pulled the trigger. She missed. He continued the relationship. "Amy, for one - and many girls in Belize - has a horrific story of abuse that if I told you, you could not believe it," McAfee explains. "Of course she's not going to be well. Of course she's going to have issues. "When she tried to shoot me in the head what I saw was a frightened child. "What I saw was a confused girl who had been so abused - physically, sexually, emotionally - beyond any description. "What are you going to do? Throw her out? That doesn't help her. "All she did was burst my eardrum. I'm deaf in one ear now, but I don't have a bullet in my head. Forgiveness is one of the graces that we have as human beings. Can I be faulted for indulging in it?" Emshwiller confirms the event but says she wanted to scare, not kill, him after he had said he wanted another girl. She adds it was not the only such incident provoked by her jealousy. "One time before, I held him in the corner and I put a knife at his throat," she says. "And he just said: 'Go ahead. Kill me.' And I couldn't do it. I just dropped the knife and walked out." Following the raid, McAfee and Emshwiller moved to his villa at San Pedro - a town on Belize's biggest island, Ambergris Caye - where they agreed to have an open relationship. There they were visited by Chad Essley, a cartoonist, who began collaborating on a book about McAfee's life. "I didn't quite realise that his lifestyle would be this older guy surrounded by young girls and bodyguards with guns," he says. "Many of these girls were former prostitutes or had very rough lives. "It was expressly forbidden to go out in the town and drink - the smell of alcohol, he could not be around it. He didn't want any of the girls doing any drugs at all. "I interviewed each of these girls, got their background. They were incredibly sad. They were definitely in a better sort of situation being around John." Meanwhile next door, Gregory Faull, an Orlando sports bar owner who had recently divorced and decided to live in his Belize holiday home, was becoming increasingly irate at his neighbour's activities. On Thursday, 8 November 2012, McAfee made the local headlines when he donated 40 stun guns, handcuffs and batons to the local police at a press conference. Mayor Daniel Guerrero thanked him, stating: "Crime is affecting the tourism industry as we have been listed on travel advisories; it is time to stop this. Let us protect our industry and turn San Pedro into the safe haven once more." That night the local TV bulletin declared that "the hatchet was formally buried", suggesting the rift between McAfee and Belize's authorities had ended. Early on Sunday morning, Mr Faull was found dead in a pool of his blood by his housekeeper. Police called to the scene found a single 9mm shell nearby. They said a mobile phone and laptop were missing but there were no visible signs of a forced entry. The head of the police's Gang Suppression Unit told a local newspaper that his officers wanted to speak to McAfee as part of the investigation, but when they called at his house he did not appear to be in. An article posted the following day by Wired magazine revealed why. McAfee told the publication he had seen the officers approaching and had hidden in the sand of his property putting a cardboard box over his head. He recalls that his caretaker had told him of Mr Faull's murder, and now he feared for his own life. "The first thing that came to my mind was, 'Oh, my Lord. The government is finally trying to rid themselves of me,' he says. "The government does from time to time. "I had certainly been a huge thorn in their side, and they had simply got the wrong white man. "Seriously, this is what went through my mind. My friends sort of calmed me down, and later said that's absurd. At the time I did not think so." McAfee acknowledges that he and Mr Faull had been at odds, but plays down the idea they hated each other or that he suspected him of being the person who had fed two of Emshwiller's dogs a poisoned tortilla. "The entire five years I was there, I'd said maybe 15 words to him," he says. "He did not like my dogs and the past two occasions I had seen him walking on the beach he complained. But so did everybody. "There was no ongoing argument. Yeah, he was mad about my dogs. Maybe as I'm beginning to think now, maybe he was the one who poisoned them. At the time I certainly did not believe that." In fact, as ABC News later revealed, Mr Faull had filed a complaint to Mayor Guerrero about McAfee the previous month. It said McAfee's dog had attacked a tourist; that his security guards had "terrified" other residents by walking around with shotguns and shining lights in their eyes, and that taxis and other traffic had been arriving at his property "at all hours", causing a disturbance. "I did not find that out until weeks after I came back to the States," says McAfee when pressed about this. "Belize is not like America where you file a complaint and then the police come out and chase things out. You file a complaint and it goes into a drawer." McAfee then went on the run, saying he feared he would be "silenced" if he was caught and thrown in jail. It made headlines worldwide, in no small part due to the fact that he was posting updates to a blog and giving frequent interviews - actions he says were designed to ensure he couldn't be made to disappear if he had been caught. "I disguised myself as a ragged salesman," he recalls. "All it takes is some dirty clothes and not bathing for a few days and not combing my hair. "You know, people saw my photograph everywhere because all of the police and army had it for that month and a half I was underground. I just made sure I looked different than that." Questioned about the affair, Dean Barrow, Belize's prime minister, made it clear McAfee was not an official murder suspect, and had only been classed instead a "person of interest". "I don't want to be unkind to the gentleman, but I believe he is extremely paranoid, even bonkers," the politician added. During this time McAfee continued to see Emshwiller. "When he was on the run I went for lunches with him and then he would call and say: 'Come to this place, or go there,' she recalls. "How to come, when to come. Not to go out, or stay home, or go to a different location. He would tell me that so nobody would get me." She adds that she regrets she did not go with him when he finally decided to escape the country. The next major development came on 3 December when a reporter and photographer from Vice magazine revealed they were documenting McAfee's life on the run. In what proved a frustrating twist for the tech guru, they then unwittingly revealed he had crossed the border to Guatemala - a fact revealed by a photo uploaded to the Vice website by staff at its headquarters, who failed to wipe its location data. "I had gone out of my way to arrange the escape and I was breathing easily and looking forward to a few days of relaxation," remembers McAfee. "We immediately had to go on the run again because we were in Guatemala illegally at this point. But it was no-one's real fault. It was just the fault of the moment." A few days later McAfee was arrested. There was initially speculation he would be sent back to Belize, but a week later he was allowed to fly to Miami a free man. "After it was over I asked myself, 'Good Lord, I must have been afraid,'" he says. "But I really can't remember. I remember merely trying to solve the problems that occurred as they occurred." McAfee has offered a $25,000 bounty for information relating to Mr Faull's death, but says an attempt to contact the victim's family proved unsuccessful. The family has called the reward a "hollow gesture" and suggested if McAfee really wanted to help he would have met with the Belize police. A spokesman for the country's government said its authorities still wanted to speak to the businessman. "Mr McAfee's claims and his behaviour have been extreme," he told the BBC. "The investigation is ongoing and McAfee remains a person of interest. If McAfee were to respond to questioning it would make a difference to the progress of the investigation - but this is currently out of the hands of the government of Belize." So long as the crime remains unsolved, it is inevitable the entrepreneur will always face suspicion. But he says he can live with that. "There's always going to be someone who likes you and someone who dislikes you," he says. "Someone who thinks you're a hero and some that think you're a villain. You know I just do what I can in situations like this to continue to state that I'm totally innocent." That doesn't mean he is trying to forget his time in Belize. In addition to the graphic novel, he is working with a Canadian firm to make both a documentary and a movie about his time there. He adds that George Jung - the imprisoned cocaine drugs lord portrayed by Johnny Depp in the film Blow - has been picked to write his biography. While those projects brew, McAfee has returned to Silicon Valley, announcing the forthcoming launch of a $100 gadget that he promises can make you invisible on the net. "If you cannot see it, you cannot hack it, you cannot look at it, you cannot spy on anything happening inside it," he explains. He says the D-Central units will fit in people's pockets and allow their phones, tablets and PCs to communicate with other owners' devices within a three-block radius. He adds they can also connect to the net anonymously via a node - a separate piece of equipment attached to the network - either directly or with their encrypted data relayed relayed via other D-Central boxes. Each will frequently change their network identifier - a long number used by devices as an ID - making them hard to track, he explains. He suggests it will appeal to college students who want to copy music anonymously and to businesses wanting to prevent the theft of corporate secrets. He's also well aware that in the light of Edward Snowden's leaks about surveillance techniques used by the US and UK governments, part of the appeal will be thwarting their efforts. "You know from their own paranoia and desire to stay in power, they are watching everything they can," he says. Will the tech work? Will he really frustrate the authorities once again? At this point, like so much of John McAfee's life, it's impossible to be sure of all the facts and it's ultimately up to you whether you take him at his word. </body>

      <title>RBS decision imminent, says Osborne</title>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>Credit union offering 'payday loans'</title>
      <description>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans.</description>

      <body>A credit union says that more than 6,000 customers have now successfully applied online for its payday-style loans. London Mutual offers people the chance to borrow between £100 and £1,000 at an interest rate of 2% per month. Borrowers do not have to save with the credit union to apply but they must live or work within one of four inner-London boroughs. Other UK credit unions are expected to adopt a similar model next year. The loans are available on the London Mutual Credit Union's CUOK website. Credit unions are currently limited to charging no more than 2% interest per month, so to borrow £400 over a month would cost just £8 in interest. Customers who want the payment on the same day as they apply have to pay an £11 fee. Borrowers must live or work within four London boroughs - Westminster, Camden, Southwark or Lambeth. They also have to undertake a short psychometric test as part of the application process. The five questions ask borrowers if they tend to obey rules and worry about what other people think of them. Lakshman Chandrasekera, London Mutual Credit Union's chief executive, said the test helped them make lending decisions: "We are trying to find out if you are the type of person who will borrow and not care about not paying. It is useful. There's a correlation between what they say and what their payment patterns are." The whole application process can be finished in under 10 minutes. Mr Chandrasekera said that applicants were given a fast service: "Our online payday loan facility is exactly the same as any other payday loan service. People can apply for the loan, get the decision there and then, and then get the money within a couple of hours." However, the cost of borrowing is significantly lower than commercial payday lenders. Many would charge more than £100 to borrow £400 for a month. Mr Chandrasekera said his credit union also makes careful checks to ensure customers will not struggle to repay the loan: "We are doing thorough checks on affordability, so we will make sure this person can afford to pay the loan." Emma took out a loan for £100 with CUOK last month in order to buy her children school uniforms which she has agreed to pay back over a three month period, costing her just £4.04 in interest: "I'd overspent on holiday with the children. We went through what I had coming in and they worked out what I could afford to pay back. I think within 24 hours I had the money. It was very easy, very straightforward." London Mutual admitted that only one in five applicants like Emma can be approved solely on the basis of the online application process. The other four out of five applicants normally then have to speak to someone over the phone to give additional information. But they would still hope to process the application within 24 hours. Michael regularly used payday loan firms until he discovered he could borrow £400 from CUOK: "Payday loan companies are so aggressive. They also charge about 10 times as much as a credit union. I didn't have to stress." Mark Lyonette, chief executive of the Association of British Credit Unions, says it is important his members speed up their processing of loans but they should still not be too short term: "The sector has just introduced an automated scoring system built on a score card working with the credit reference agencies. We might not be keen on making loans for a 10-day period but we absolutely need to not take 10 days to make a loan." Some industry commentators believe there are strict limits to the extent that credit unions could ever compete with payday lenders. Julian Knight, money editor of the Independent newspaper, says payday lending has grown too big: "They just don't have the scale. The payday lending industry is worth £3m to £4m. It would just be a scratch on the surface." Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

      <title>Banks 'said Royal Mail underpriced'</title>
      <description>Two investment banks canvassed by government 'warned Royal Mail sell-off price was too cheap'.</description>

      <body>The government ignored two banks that valued Royal Mail at £5bn, far more than shares were sold for, the Financial Times has reported. The government sold 60% of the postal service last week for £3.30 per share, but they soon passed £5. The FT said at least two banks had said shares would be worth up to £5 each. The government said banks' estimates had been made long before fresh factors arose, such as strike threats and financial uncertainty in the US. The government sought opinion from investment banks bidding to manage the sale, and selected Lazard as its independent adviser, before deciding to dispose of 60% of Royal Mail at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) price of £3.3bn. Goldman Sachs, Barclays, Bank of America Merill Lynch and UBS were appointed to lead the sale. Lazard has now been called in by the Commons Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) select committee to answer questions on the pricing after shares had hit 508.3p, before closing at 502.5p. In a statement, a Department for Business, Innovation and Skills spokesman said seven of the 21 banks that pitched in May to act for the government on the sale of Royal Mail were successful. "The proposals included indicative valuations of the company based, in many instances, solely on information already in the public domain," he said. "Banks made their own assumptions of Royal Mail future performance. "The range was wide with the median around £3.6 billion taking into account IPO [initial public offering] discount. The banks appointment process was overseen by Lazard as independent advisers to government. He added: "The banks' proposals came months before any threat of strike action by the unions, financial market uncertainty in the United States and other factors which the government has already said were taken into consideration in setting a price for the company in September." Business select committee member Nadhim Zahawi said he believed the government had got its sums right. Conservative MP Mr Zahawi said he thought the government had acted wisely, given the risks of a flotation. He told the BBC News Channel: "The right thing to do is to bring in as many banks as possible. Ones that work closely with the Royal Mail, ones that advise the government. "When you are trying to get a placing that large away, what you don't want is egg on your face if it doesn't get the investment community excited." He added: "It feels to me that this story is a bit of sour grapes from a couple of banks who weren't very close to the business. "The problem to remember as well is that the government still has a substantial shareholding that at some stage it will want to sell down." Mr Zahawi warned of the danger that could be posed should the government face the prospect of selling its remaining stake at below the launch price and that it would be "far more negative than a successful IPO with shares going up". It was common practice to see government sell-offs priced at around 20% below full value so early investors are not penalised. He said: "Let's look at the share price in six months' time when the froth has gone away when you take out the initial spike and where the shares settle. When you look at comparators ie on dividend on yield on profitability, I think the price was just about right." </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <title>Biggest petrol price fall since 2008</title>
      <description>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest monthly fall since 2008, taking the average cost of a litre of fuel to 132.16p.</description>

      <body>The AA says petrol prices have recorded their biggest fall since 2008, taking the average cost to 132.16p a litre. The motorists' lobby group said average petrol prices fell 5.49p a litre between mid-September and mid-October, the biggest monthly fall since prices fell 11.5p in November 2008. The price of diesel has fallen from 142.50p a litre to 139.12p. The AA said lower wholesale fuel prices had prompted the price drop, but warned that further falls were unlikely. The organisation says the recent drop in prices means the cost of filling up the tank of a small petrol car has fallen by £2.74, while a larger vehicle, such as a Ford Mondeo, would cost £3.84 less to refuel. Northern Ireland is the most expensive place for petrol, with an average pump price of £132.9p a litre, and London, the north of England, and Yorkshire and Humberside are the joint cheapest at 131.9p. Scotland is still the most expensive for diesel at 140.1p a litre, while London is the cheapest at 138.6p. Regional variations depend on whether an area is mainly urban - in which case there is more competition - or if it is mainly rural - in which case suppliers have higher transport costs and there is less competition. Overall, the AA says the UK has the seventh-highest petrol price and the second-highest diesel price in Europe. The fuel price data is supplied by the research firm Experian Catalist. The AA said further falls in petrol prices were unlikely, because of poor refinery capacity in the UK and the likely strengthening of the US dollar. The US dollar is expected to rise in value now that the standoff over the country's budget is over and oil is priced in dollars. The AA's president, Edmund King, said: "A more than £2.50-a-tank cut in petrol costs for families is a dramatic improvement on its own. But, heading into winter with cars using more fuel, the timing couldn't be better. "Alongside Asda, Sainsbury's decision to fully reflect the fall in wholesale prices has been a huge benefit for drivers and businesses. "However, the AA is also encouraged by the growing band of non-supermarket retailers challenging the pricing of other supermarkets whose prices in many places are far less generous," he added. The organisation said that the situation at the Grangemouth refinery in Scotland, where a dispute between management and unions has led to a temporary closure, had highlighted the UK's lack of refinery capacity. It urged the government to find ways to support domestic refineries. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail 'sales pitch leaked'</title>
      <description>The RMT says it has obtained leaked documents that show the government is playing down the success of a publicly-owned rail line in its pitch to would-be investors.</description>

      <body>A rail union claims to have obtained a leaked copy of a prospectus for the privatisation of the East Coast Main Line. The RMT says the document shows the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership to "bulldoze" the sale of it through. The East Coast line was taken back into public hands in 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise. The government said the RMT was "scaremongering". But the RMT says the leaked prospectus showed the government was engaged in a "systematic and politically motivated devaluation of the performance" of the line, which is due to return to private hands in 2015. The document appears to be a draft version of the final sale brochure for potential investors, with handwritten notes and revisions in the margin. It is intended for "investment professionals only" and not for wider circulation, the text warns. The union claims a paragraph noting the line "three percentage points ahead of the long-distance train operator average" in the 2012 National Passenger Survey had been deleted. A comment on the document also referred to avoiding "references to competitors", the union claimed. "The crucial commentary that East Coast is not only ahead of Virgin and First Great Western - the other inter-city franchise holders - but that East Coast under public ownership is also amongst the highest performers in Europe for passengers per mile had been redacted," the union added. RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: "This leaked document, coming on the day of union protests at Parliament aimed at keeping the East Coast in public ownership, is political dynamite which blows the lid off the lengths to which the government are prepared to go to bulldoze through reprivatisation before the next election. "The fact that the public option is putting over £1bn back into the Treasury, while improving services and delivering more capacity, has been cynically airbrushed out of the final document in a disgraceful piece of political chicanery which must be called in for scrutiny to hold back this full-tilt dash for privatisation." The union also said the document redacts sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. But a Department for Transport spokesman said: "This is ill informed scaremongering from the RMT. "By choosing to release inaccurate information, they are misleading the public. We have no intention of requiring a 'third class' service, reducing performance levels, or in any way devaluing this vital railway. "As the independent Brown Review concluded, franchising works for passengers and taxpayers alike. " Labour says services can be run just as well under public ownership. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: "East Coast is working well and will have returned £800m to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year. "This government has learned nothing from the West Coast franchising fiasco, which saw over £50m of taxpayers' money wasted in compensation to train companies, through ministers' incompetence." </body>

      <title>Fire burns tonnes of sugar in Brazil</title>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>Private rents 'hit record high'</title>
      <description>The cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey.</description>

      <body>The average cost of renting a home privately across England and Wales has reached a record high of £757 a month, according to a survey. Average rents rose by 2.1% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, LSL Property Services said. This was a 1.8% increase on August, driven by a 3.3% rise in the south east of England. The figures come as mortgage lenders reported another strong month in September, after a summer flurry. LSL said that greater demand from tenants was pushing up rental prices. "Higher rents in almost every region show that, despite government schemes, buying a first home is still a difficult aspiration," said David Newnes, director of LSL, which owns estate agents Reeds Rains and Your Move. "This is not only down to low salary growth, but also a general shortage of supply - which is the underlying reason why homes are getting more expensive. The long-term trend to renting therefore looks unlikely to change significantly in the near future." The government has brought forward its Help to Buy scheme, which aims to assist those who can afford mortgage payments, but struggle to raise the necessary deposit to secure a mortgage and purchase a home. However, critics have said that the scheme could create a housing market bubble, with official statistics suggesting UK house prices are already at a record high. Figures from the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML), also published on Friday, showed that mortgage lending for house purchases continued its summer strength. Gross mortgage lending in the UK stood at £16.2bn in September, slightly below lending of £16.4bn in August, but 41% higher than lending of £11.5bn in September last year. "Indicators suggest we are witnessing the strongest house purchase performance in five years. House prices too have revived but modestly, aside from a resurgent London market," said CML chief economist Bob Pannell. The LSL survey suggested that tenants' finances were stretched. Some 8.5% of all rent across England and Wales was late in September, up from 7.8% in August. However, the annual rise in rental costs was still slower than the general increase in the cost of living, with the Consumer Prices Index measure of inflation at 2.7% in September. </body>

      <title>Bank says rate rise unlikely in 2014</title>
      <description>The Bank of England's chief economist Spencer Dale says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rate rise next year.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England's chief economist, Spencer Dale, says economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in interest rates next year. In a question and answer session on the social network Twitter, he said the UK would need to see sustained growth before rates rose from the 0.5% level. Earlier this week he said that rates could rise in 2014 if conditions were strong enough. Mr Dale is one of the nine people at the Bank that set monetary policy. As might be expected from a central banker, Mr Dale gave little in the way of surprises in his answers on current monetary policy. In its latest minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current record low of 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. Many questioners wanted to know about QE. Asked "is Quantitative Easing a necessary evil? What will be the implications on the UK's macroeconomic objectives?", Mr Dale replied:"QE not evil. Has helped to support economy and protect jobs." Another of the big economic debates in the country is whether or not house prices are rising dangerously high. When asked if he had any concerns that there was a housing bubble, fuelled by the Help to Buy scheme which helps borrowers struggling to raise a deposit, Mr Dale answered: "A healthy housing market is good for economy. But watching carefully for overheating." Twitter's unfiltered nature inevitably draws offbeat comments. Of less importance to UK economy watchers was "do you ever polish the gold 1Kg brick in the museum?" "No need," was the reply, "It stays shiny without out being polished." But questions to Mr Dale answered in the hour-long session were markedly more serious and respectful than the session held by British Gas on Thursday, which was widely hailed as a lesson in how not to engage through social media. </body>

      <body>One of the UK's smallest energy suppliers - Co-operative Energy - has joined two of the big firms in announcing price rises. The firm, which started in 2011 and has 150,000 customers, will increase gas and electricity prices by 4.5%. Existing customers will see their bills go up from 8 January, but the price rise will take effect for new customers from Monday. SSE and British Gas have outlined price rises in recent days. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November and British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November. These two are part of the group of major UK domestic energy suppliers, known as the "big six". Ministers have said it has been difficult for smaller firms to compete with these major firms. Co-operative Energy, which operates in England, Scotland and Wales and is part of The Midcounties Co-operative, said it had absorbed half of the increased costs it was facing. "Due to increasing energy market costs beyond our control, namely the costs associated with buying energy and getting it into customers' homes, we find ourselves in the position of having to now pass these costs on to our customers," said Ramsay Dunning, general manager of Co-operative Energy. </body>

      <body>Canada and the European Union have struck a free trade agreement aimed at boosting growth and employment. The deal will lower tariffs, streamline regulation, and cut red tape. Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso agreed the deal at a meeting in Brussels on Friday. Mr Barroso said they had reached a "breakthrough in negotiations" to achieve "a great agreement for both the European Union and Canada". The deal still requires approval by parliaments and EU member states. Once approved, the agreement aims to make it easier for companies in Canada and the 28-member EU bloc to invest in and sell to each other. The European Union is Canada's second-largest trading partner behind the US. Mr Harper said the agreement was "the biggest (trade) deal our country has ever made". It will give Canada access to a market of some 500 million people in the EU, making it bigger even than the country's North American Free Trade Agreement signed with the US and Mexico. The European Commission expects the deal to increase bilateral trade in goods and services by a fifth to 25.7bn euros ($35bn; £21.7bn) a year. The commission is negotiating trade pacts with more than 80 countries on behalf of the bloc's members following the collapse of the Doha global trade talks. </body>

      <title>Toyota to recall 885,000 vehicles</title>
      <description>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles, mainly in North America, to fix a problem that could lead to airbags being disabled or inadvertently deploying.</description>

      <body>Toyota is recalling 885,000 vehicles to fix a problem that could cause a water leak from the air conditioning unit. It said water could leak into the airbag control module, causing a short circuit and triggering a warning light. In some cases airbags "could become disabled or could inadvertently deploy" and in limited cases the power steering function could be disabled, it added. The models affected by the recall are the Camry, Camry Hybrid, Avalon, Avalon Hybrid, and Venza made in 2012-13. Some 847,000 cars will be recalled in North America, while the rest will be in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A spokeswoman for Toyota told the BBC that it had received reports of two minor injuries due to the issue, but there had been no reports of any vehicles crashing. This is the third major recall that Toyota has issued in recent weeks. Last month, the company called back more than 780,000 vehicles in the US to address a suspension defect in its RAV4 and Lexus HS 250h models, after fears that an initial recall last year did not fix the problem. In September, it recalled 615,000 Sienna minivans in the US to fix a lever problem that could cause vehicles to shift out of park mode "without the driver depressing the brake pedal". Toyota said at the time that it was aware of 24 "minor accidents" due to the issue. In recent weeks more than 2.2 million vehicles have been recalled. Analysts said the recalls could have an impact on its reputation with the customers. "Repeated recalls definitely dent the image of any carmaker," Vivek Vaidya, an auto analyst with consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "If you have one big recall, it is still manageable. But if (a company) calls back different vehicle models at different times for unrelated issues, customers tend to have a re-think about your quality assurance. "And if the problem involves airbag deployment - it becomes a serious issue," he added. The latest move takes the total number of cars recalled by Toyota this year to six million vehicles. </body>

      <body>Women's fashion chain Bonmarche, which sells to the over-50s age group, is planning to list its shares on the stock market. It has 264 stores but also sells online and through mail-order systems, including a TV channel. Bonmarche was owned by fashion chain Peacocks, but was bought in 2012 by investors Sun European Partners when Peacocks went into administration. Bonmarche says it has 1.8 million customers in its loyalty club. The chain has the licence to use the David Emmanuel name, one half of the team that designed Princess Diana's wedding dress in the early 1980s. Announcing its intention to float, the company cited figures from the Office for National Statistics and retail specialists Verdict predicting that the number of women over the age of 55 - its target market - would be 16% higher in 2018 than in 2008. Bonmarche says there are a limited number of rivals serving this market. The firm's chief executive, Beth Butterwick, said: "The success and strong performance enjoyed by the business over the last 18 months... makes this an opportune time to bring the company to AIM [London's junior share market]." Sun European Partners, whose main assets and base are in the US, also owns the Jacques Vert chain in the UK. Bonmarche has its head office in Wakefield in West Yorkshire. It was founded in 1982 and bought by Peacocks in 2002. </body>

      <title>British Gas Twitter move draws ire</title>
      <description>An attempt by British Gas to engage its customers in a question and answer session on Twitter ended up attracting a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage.</description>

      <body>It surely seemed like a good way to present a human face to customers. On the day it announced prices would rise by 9.2%, British Gas decided to take to the micro-blogging site Twitter to conduct a QandA with its public. But the hashtag #AskBG instead ended up crowd-sourcing a riot of opinion that included black humour and rage. This one was straight to the point: "Social media car crash: British Gas hike energy bills by £123 and then ask Twitter what it thinks." Others were even more blunt: "I've been a loyal customer for a few years. How will you feel when pensioners die from choosing to eat instead of heat???" The session started civilly enough with a simple announcement that British Gas's customer services director would be available for questions. Among the few conventional questions was this: Claire asked: "@BritishGas I can barely make current payments to you. My income is v.low. Can you assist me, or shld I switch?" This was one of the minority of posts British Gas could give a simple answer to: "Hi Claire, if you are worried about rising energy costs please call us 0800 980 1917 or visit http://britishgas.co.uk/warmhomes." Such questions though were swamped by those expressing worry about their bills, or venting their anger at the cost of energy, with typical comments on the plight of pensioners and alternative fuels, such as £10 notes. British Gas sent out a statement after the session had closed: "Our announcement today is difficult news for customers. We didn't make this decision lightly. We know people are worried about rising energy prices and they want to talk about this - including on Twitter - and it's important we're there for them to talk to" It said the QandA was the "right thing to do". </body>

      <title>Bid for fuel discount in rural towns</title>
      <description>A fuel discount that applies to the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to remote and rural parts of the UK mainland.</description>

      <body>A fuel discount scheme in the Scottish islands and the Isles of Scilly could be extended to 10 rural communities in mainland Scotland and England. The UK has applied to the European Commission (EC) for a 5p a litre reduction in fuel duty in those places. They are Acharacle, Achnasheen, Appin, Carrbridge, Dalwhinnie, Gairloch and Strathpeffer. Kirkby-in-Furness in Cumbria, Hawes in North Yorkshire and Lynton in Devon are also included. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander said that, as a Highlander, he knew "all too well that fuel prices tend to be highest in areas where a car is needed the most". "We've already delivered a tax cut for remote islands and now want to extend that to mainland rural areas that suffer from similarly high prices to the islands," he added. "We have put together the strongest possible evidence base to try and maximise the places that get it." A decision from the EC is expected next year. "As I've said before, it won't be easy to get this agreed with the commission, but I will do everything I can to make this happen," Mr Alexander said. The 10 locations selected for the application have higher pump prices than in areas that already receive discount, are more than 100 miles by road from the nearest refinery and have a population density lower than 135 people per square km. Pete Williams, RAC head of external affairs, said the application was "good news" because many people in rural communities were "unfairly penalised by high fuel prices as they rely on their cars for work and day-to-day life". "It's also understandable that fuel retailers in these remote areas are selling petrol and diesel at higher prices due to increased distribution costs from being so far from refineries," he added. "Let's hope the European Commission will see the sense in easing the pain for these rural towns when they come to make their decision next year." Labour Treasury spokeswoman Catherine McKinnell said she hoped the announcement would bring relief for drivers in the selected areas. But she added: "Eight out of 10 of these areas have Liberal Democrat MPs - including two in Danny Alexander's own constituency. The public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a Lib Dem Treasury minister who refuses to tackle the cost-of-living crisis everywhere but his own back yard." Mr Alexander told BBC Breakfast it was "total nonsense" to suggest the plans were designed to favour seats held by his party. The idea had been put forward by his party in its election manifesto, he said, but the locations had been chosen "according to a strict selection criteria". He said it "would be nice to have a longer list" but the 10 communities chosen had a "reasonable chance of being agreed". Introduced in March 2012, the discount currently applies to the Hebrides, Northern Isles, islands in the Clyde and the Isles of Scilly as well as other island communities in Europe. Retailers register with HM Revenue and Customs to claim 5p a litre relief on fuel for sale to the public. </body>

      <body>Retail sales grew by 0.6% in September compared with the previous month, following an unexpected fall in August. The Office for National Statistics also said sales volumes had risen by 2.2% compared with September 2012, despite a fall of sales in supermarkets. The retail sales figures are based on a monthly survey of 5,000 UK retailers. The performance of the retail industry is seen as an indicator of the wider economy and the strength of consumer spending. Furniture sales provided the biggest driver for the monthly rise in sales, owing to a pick-up in the housing market. Sales volumes in household goods stores grew by 3%. Retail sales have see-sawed in recent months. In July, the fine summer weather pushed sales up higher than expected, with barbecue food selling well. Then, a month later, consumers reined in spending, particularly on food, leading to a drop in sales volumes. In September, analysts had expected a rebound, but not to the degree seen in the latest official figures. In addition to household goods, sales at clothing, footwear and textile retailers increased by 1.2% compared with August. Ian Geddes, UK head of retail at Deloitte, said although confidence was rising, growth in wages remained "stubbornly low", so many consumers were "yet to benefit" from having more money. He said pressure was on for retailers to get their product and brand "exactly right". "Those who deliver highly desirable and creative products with distinctive and well-understood branding continue to reap the rewards," Mr Geddes added. David Tinsley, UK economist at BNP Paribas, said he expected recovery in the housing market to "start to show up shortly". But he said wages would have to rise before a more sustainable recovery could happen. "We would not be surprised to see some softer patches in retail spending ahead," he added. </body>

      <body>British Gas is to increase prices for domestic customers, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2% from 23 November. The increase, which will affect nearly eight million households in the UK, includes an 8.4% rise in gas prices and a 10.4% increase in electricity prices. The company said it "understands the frustration" of prices rising faster than incomes. The average annual household bill will go up by £123. PM David Cameron has urged consumers to switch suppliers for the best deal. Energy Minister Ed Davey has described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers. Rival SSE has already announced an 8.2% increase in bills from 15 November. On average, customers will see a dual-fuel bill increase to £1,444 a year. However, there are significant regional variations. On average, the biggest increase in a dual-fuel bill is an 11.2% rise in the north of Scotland, in the Scottish Hydro Electric region. The smallest is a 6.8% increase in the south west of England. The company said that the cost of buying energy on the global markets, delivering gas and electricity to customers' homes, and the government's "green" levies, were all factors in the decision to put up prices. "I know these are difficult times for many customers and totally understand the frustration that so many household costs keep on rising when incomes are not keeping pace," said Ian Peters, managing director of British Gas Residential Energy. "We haven't taken this decision lightly, but what is pushing up energy prices at the moment are costs that are not all directly under our control." The company, which operates as Scottish Gas in Scotland, said it made a profit of five pence in the pound after tax. British Gas, the UK's biggest energy supplier, said in May that a profit boost would be used to delay future price rises. This came because customers used 18% more gas in the first four months of the year owing to the cold weather. At the time, a spokesman said: "We will use that [cold weather benefit] to effectively hold prices for as long as possible." Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies outlined price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Caroline Flint, shadow energy secretary, said: "These latest price rises show clearer than ever why Labour's price freeze is needed." Party leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. But the prime minister branded Mr Miliband's price freeze plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. Mr Cameron also said he was disappointed with the British Gas' announcement. "I would encourage customers who are not happy with the service they're getting, are not happy with the prices, to go to the switching sites online and see whether they can get a better deal," he said. Pressed on whether the government could do more to tackle the underlying issues, Mr Cameron added: "What we can do, which is what we are doing, is to try to get new suppliers into the market." Energy Minister Ed Davey also described the latest price rise as "extremely disappointing news" for customers of British Gas. He questioned the claim that costs imposed by the government were increasing as much as bills and told the Commons that unhappy consumers should consider switching suppliers. However, industry analysts expect other suppliers to announce price rises in the coming weeks, which could affect consumers' switching decisions. "The question now is whether it will be a trickle or a stampede. However, the fact is that households will be struggling to afford to keep warm this winter," said Tom Lyon, of price comparison website Uswitch.com. Ofgem data shows the number of people switching energy companies is at the lowest since records began in 2003. Out of more than 27.7m electricity customers, 658,000 people switched companies in the three months from March to June in 2013, 17% less than the same quarter a year before. For gas, out of nearly 22m customers, 490,000 people transferred over the same three-month period, a 14% decline from 2012. Personal finance commentator and campaigner Martin Lewis said it was important that, if consumers do decide to switch, they should focus on fixed rate tariffs. Because only two of the energy companies have currently put their prices up, those who switch now are likely to be hit with price rises if they switch to another variable rate tariff. He said people can "beat the price hikes" by going to fixed tariffs. Adam Scorer, of watchdog Consumer Futures, said: "We would urge anyone worried about their energy costs to shop around to try to find a better deal and ensure they are on the cheapest payment method, such as direct debit. "There are also some discounted insulation and heating measures available and we would encourage people to take advantage of this to cut their bills." Mr Davey said that British Gas would need to justify its decision "openly and transparently". Many of British Gas's customers made their annoyance at the price rise known during a Twitter question and answer session with customer service Bert Pijls earlier this afternoon. </body>

      <title>US government heads back to work</title>
      <description>US government employees are back at work after President Obama signed a law ending a government shutdown and raising the US debt limit.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of thousands of US government employees are back at work after President Barack Obama signed a law ending a 16-day government shutdown and extending the US debt limit. The cross-party deal came hours before the US government risked running out of money to pay its bills. "There are no winners," Mr Obama said, adding the US would "bounce back". The deal followed 16 days of partial government shutdown, which began when Congress failed to agree on a budget. Congress voted through the deal less hours before a deadline to raise the $16.7tn (£10.5tn) debt limit. The measure approved in Washington funds the government to 15 January, and extends the US Treasury's borrowing authority until 7 February. The deal does not resolve the budgetary issues that fiercely divide Republicans and Democrats. Instead, it establishes a cross-party committee of legislators tasked with crafting a long-term budget deal and reporting back to Congress by mid-December. A faction of Republicans in the hardline Tea Party movement had pushed for the confrontation as a way to gut Mr Obama's healthcare reform. However, Mr Obama and the Democrats refused to negotiate, and the law commonly known as Obamacare escaped relatively unscathed. On Thursday, Mr Obama thanked congressional leaders for their help ending the government shutdown and raising the debt limit, but said both had "inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy". "Nothing has done more to undermine our economy the last three years than the kind of tactics that create these kinds of manufactured crises," he said. Mr Obama said politicians had to stop listening to "talking heads" and activists "who profit from conflict" and instead focus on growing the economy and creating a responsible budget. "The American people are completely fed up with Washington," he said. "How business is done in this town has to change." Mr Obama called the political crises "a spectacle" which had hurt America's credibility in the world. And to the conservative Republicans who pushed the showdown as a way to extract policy concessions, he said: "Go out there and win an election." Politicians, bankers and economists had warned of global economic calamity unless an agreement to raise the US government's borrowing limit were reached. IMF head Christine Lagarde's positive response to the news was tempered by a call for further action. "It will be essential to reduce uncertainty surrounding the conduct of fiscal policy by raising the debt limit in a more durable manner," she said in a statement. Economists have estimated the shutdown cost the US economy billions of dollars. The shutdown affected Americans and visitors to the US in countless ways: most national parks were closed, medical research ground to a halt, and ordinary paperwork went unfinished, delaying visa applications, business permits and safety inspections. Hundreds of thousands of employees were put on leave without pay during the shutdown, with many forced to delay purchases or even payment of routine bills. A few days into the shutdown Congress passed a law ensuring they would receive back pay. Before dawn on Thursday, the US Office of Personnel Management, which manages the federal workforce, announced in a terse statement on its website that government workers should return to work as regularly scheduled. A senior manager at the Department of the Interior, which oversees the national parks system and other public land, reminded employees to disable "out of office" email messages, change voicemail prompts, and "check on any refrigerators and throw out any perished food". "We appreciate your sacrifices through these difficult times and we understand that the lapse in government activities has imposed hardships on you, your families, and the people we serve," Rhea Suh, assistant secretary for policy, management and budget, wrote. Federal workers returning to the downtown Washington DC office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) were greeted by Vice-President Joe Biden and a welcome note from their boss, agency head Gina McCarthy. A security officer at the building said the shutdown had been "depressing" and had made her realise how much she enjoyed her job. "I enjoy checking in 500 people every day," said Ettereteen Welch. Spurred on by hardline conservatives, congressional Republicans forced the stand-off by linking budget measures to healthcare reform. Despite reluctant support from the House Republican leadership for the bill approved on Wednesday, most of the party's lawmakers in the House voted against it. Republican Congressman Mo Brooks told the Associated Press news agency the law that ended the shutdown merely delayed the fight. "We need to get to the underlying cause of the problem, which is our out-of-control spending and deficits," he said, "and fix it before it's too late and we go down the toilet to bankruptcy. Because that's where America is headed." </body>

      <title>Warning of future UK power shortages</title>
      <description>The UK power system is likely to be stretched "close to its limits" in the coming years, a new report warns.</description>

      <body>There is a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years, according to a report commissioned for the prime minister. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is particularly expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Last week the National Grid warned of a higher risk of blackouts this winter. The new study was commissioned by the prime minister's Council for Science and Technology to find out how stretched power supplies are likely to be during this decade. "Although the electricity supply is expected to be sufficient to cover predicted levels of demand, it is likely to stretch the system close to its limits, notably during the winter of 2014-15," the report said. Dr John Roberts, one of its authors, added: "We've looked back at real events that happened in the past which caused shocks to our system - like very cold winters, like major power stations shutting down. "If those things happen again in the future and we don't take measures to correct what's going on, then there's a serious risk that we will have power shortages." To avoid what its authors called "a blackout scenario by 2020", the report called on ministers to: Reacting to the report, Business Minister Michael Fallon said: "The lights are not going to go out. There will be a tightness in supply if nothing is done but stuff is being done. "We've opened six new gas plants already. Another is being built. You're going to hear very soon about our investment in new nuclear power stations." Two years ago the UK had a buffer between energy supply and demand of 16%, but this winter that will fall to 5% and it could hit 2% by 2015, according to the National Grid and the energy regulator, Ofgem. </body>

      <title>UK jobless total falls to 2.49m</title>
      <description>The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period and employment hit a record high.</description>

      <body>The number of unemployed in the UK fell by 18,000 to 2.49 million in the June-August period, official figures show. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) also said the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance last month fell by 41,700 to 1.35 million. The unemployment rate drops to 7.7%, down from 7.8% the previous quarter. The number of people in work, both full-time and part-time, reached a record high of 29.87 million in the quarter, up 155,000. The ONS looks at demand for full-time work and whether part-time workers would rather work longer hours. It said almost 1.5 million people were part-time because they could not find full-time jobs, the highest figure since records began in 1992. The unemployment rate has become a key economic indicator for the Bank of England which, under its recently appointed new governor, Mark Carney, is targeting the unemployment rate. It says it will not consider raising interest rates from their record low of 0.5% until it falls to 7%. The ONS also reported average earnings rose by 0.8% in the year to August. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym points out this increase in regular pay (excluding bonuses) equalled the lowest recorded in the history of this series. He adds that the fall of 0.1% in average earnings in the public sector over the year to August was the first time such a decrease had been recorded. There was a sharp difference in the number of men and women in part-time employment, with male part-timers increasing by 21,000 and women in part-time work falling by 13,000. But more women were finding full-time work than men, with male full-time employment up by 69,000 compared with a rise of 79,000 for women. Youth unemployment remains just below the one-million mark, with 958,000 unemployed 16 to 24-year-olds, down by 1,000 over the quarter. The number of people unemployed for more than a year fell by 15,000 to 900,000. Those without work for between six months to a year rose by 29,000 to 446,000, but there was a fall of 32,000 people unemployed for up to six months, leaving 1.1 million in that position. The worst affected areas in the UK were in Birmingham Ladywood where the unemployment rate stands at 11.4% and in West Belfast where it is 9.3%. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, said the figures were "good news". He added: "These are welcome figures. Of course, we all want to see living standards improve, and last year disposable income increased. But the way to deliver on living standards is to grow the economy, keep producing the jobs and cut people's taxes." The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, said Mr Cameron should admit that there was "a cost-of-living crisis in this country". Mr Miliband said: "Today's economic figures show a welcome fall in unemployment. They also show that prices have risen faster than wages and that is 39 out of 40 months that living standards have fallen since he became prime minister." The Institute of Directors (IoD) said the jobs data showed the recovery was "job-lite". The IoD's chief economist, Graeme Leach, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: "Today's labour market figures are not surprising. Just as employment losses during the recession were lower than expected, so too are employment gains with recovery. This isn't a jobless recovery but it is a job-lite one." The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) gave a cautious welcome to the figures. Its chief economist, David Kern, said: "Although concerns remain over youth and long-term employment, the figures show that Britain's labour market is strong and flexible, and that the economy should record satisfactory growth in the third quarter. The large fall in inactivity is particularly pleasing, as more people are returning to the workforce and are looking for jobs." He added that he expected the unemployment rate to continue to fall steadily and that the 7% unemployment rate targeted by the Bank of England would be reached in the autumn of 2015, a year earlier than the Bank had indicated. </body>

      <title>Australia's surf firms making waves</title>
      <description>Surfing is a national pastime in Australia, which continues to sustain a significant community of small firms, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517642</url>
      <date>1381964753</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70463000/jpg/_70463014_aus1afp.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A century ago, Duke Kahanamoku, a majestic Hawaiian board rider, helped to ignite modern Australia's passion for surfing. His showboating exhibition on the waves at Freshwater Beach in Sydney is widely seen as the catalyst for a national obsession. Picked from a curious crowd, a teenage girl was given what was almost certainly Australia's first official surfing lesson by the man known simply as the Duke. Today, the same swells that barrel in from the Pacific Ocean continue to thrill and they now sustain a range of small businesses that feed the popular surf tourism industry. At nearby Manly Beach, a class of beginners is about to take to the water for the very first time. It's a hot day in spring, and conditions are perfect for novices - the breeze is light, the waves gentle and the tuition patient. "It's a tough sport. Surfing is very similar to golf - you never master it, there are always things you can learn," says Nick James, from Manly Surf School, which was founded in 1995 and has 20 full-time staff. It pays about 50,000 Australian dollars ($47,000; £29,600) per year to the local council for exclusive rights to operate on one of Sydney's most celebrated stretches of sand. A standard two-hour group lesson for an adult costs A$70, while children pay A$55. Mr James says that business is generally vibrant, but admits that, like the weather, things can be unpredictable. "It's challenging. We've got to pay licences to run our surf schools on the beaches. "It's a good business, but there are times when we're closed for a week due to the surf conditions." There are 35 licensed surf schools in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. The sport's regional governing body has estimated that surfing pumps more than A$500m into the state's economy. "The sport is becoming increasingly more attractive," says Mark Windon, chief executive of Surfing New South Wales. "It is becoming more mainstream. It is just going to get more popular. In the next 10 years, you'll probably see triple the growth that you've seen in the last 10." At Manly, the latest converts tentatively paddle out for their initial encounter with the breakers. They have limited success - boards suddenly become airborne, dumping their breathless passengers into the drink. But back they come for more, and herein lies the secret to surfing's success. For many, its magnetic appeal is irresistible, and what's hearty for the soul is also good for the bottom line, according to Stacey Randell, executive officer of the Manly Chamber of Commerce. "Our whole region is based on the water, and surfing is huge economically speaking, and the amount of visitors it brings in every year is vital to the businesses in this community. Everybody benefits from this culture," she says. Yet while wave riding in Australia has never been more popular, independent surfing shops are struggling to stay afloat in a highly competitive market. "It is not particularly an easy living for most surf shop owners. You'll find most of them are pressed pretty hard by the big corporates to sell specific merchandise and conform to corporate dictates," says Doug Booth, the Australian-born dean of the School of Physical Education, Sport and Exercise Sciences at the University of Otago in New Zealand. A couple of streets back from Manly's sun-drenched waterfront, Tim Hanrahan, the owner of the Aloha surf shop, unloads another consignment of high-end boards. I ask if his head is financially above water? "Just," he says, laughing. "I make OK money." "It's difficult. It's not an easy job. The profit margins particularly on the boards are quite low. I've seen a lot of competitors come and go. "There is a lot of tourism in Manly, but realistically you've got to have the locals behind you, too. That's what keeps you going through the quieter months." Surfing Australia estimates there are more than 2.5 million recreational board riders around the country. It is far beyond simply a sport, but a lifestyle and cultural phenomenon that tourists are keen to experience. "I've always wanted to surf," says Ashton Williams, an investment software worker from Mississippi in the United States, as he wades out of the ocean at the end of his lesson at Manly. "It's much tougher than I thought, but when you're finally gliding over the water it is one of the most peaceful things. It's pretty amazing." </body>

      <title>Nepalese airline taking off</title>
      <description>The BBC's Surendra Phuyal talks to Birendra Bahadur Basnet about growing a private airline in Nepal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24513257</url>

      <body>What makes an entrepreneur? The BBC's Surendra Phuyal hears from Birendra Bahadur Basnet, a private-airline owner in Nepal, about the risks he took starting his business, and how he believes success can be achieved. He does not come from a family of business people. His father is a retired judge, his ancestors were farmers in eastern Nepal. But Birendra Bahadur Basnet, 49, is amongst Nepal's most successful entrepreneurs. He has carved a niche in the country's not-so-impressive aviation sector in just a few years. When he registered his airline, Buddha Air, and started operations in 1996, the business graduate from a Kathmandu university had only one aircraft that was purchased with a loan: a US-made Beechcraft 1900D. Nearly two decades later, he is is the proud owner of nine aircraft - three Beechcraft 1900, three ATR 42-320 and three ATR 72-500 aircraft. Basnet's Buddha Air fleet is the largest in Nepal's domestic sector. "When we obtained the loan of around NPR 70m (£442,000; $708,000) in 1996 to set up our business and purchase an aircraft, our friends and relatives and other people said we had gone mad," Basnet, says, smiling. "But we started doing good in aviation sector and we paid our loan after six years," he says, adding his airline business has grown almost ten-fold since then. When he started, he recalls Nepal's state-owned airline Royal Nepal Airlines was not particularly successful and the newly liberalised domestic aviation market was looking for stable players from the private sector. "That's precisely where we saw the gap and we jumped in," he says. "The market was competitive, but safety, reliability and comfort being our mantra, we succeeded in winning the trust of our customers and we have been adding aircraft, one after another to our fleet." Basnet's road to success has not been easy though; the biggest blow came in September 2011 when one of his Beechcraft crashed on a hill near Kathmandu while returning from an aborted Mount Everest sightseeing flight, killing 19 people. "We thought we were invincible, but that crash proved we were not," he said, tears welling up in his eyes. "We lost three of our great colleagues, several other people and the aircraft. "That was a very sad experience that we had, but that also helped us grow." After the crash, he says, the airline did a review of its flight safety mechanisms and other related procedures to ensure that Buddha Air's safety standards remain impeccable. "We thought people would choose other airlines after the crash, we were concerned," he says. "But that didn't affect our business. People - both Nepalis and foreigners - continued to love us." Every morning, Buddha Air attracts dozens of foreign tourists to Kathmandu airport for its early morning sightseeing flights to the Mount Everest region - it hosted former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan when he visited Nepal in 2001. Boasting Nepal's first private airline to have its own hangar within Kathmandu Airport premises, Buddha Air flies to major towns inside Nepal and connects the Indian city of Varanashi with Kathmandu. "We are the first private airline to fly outside Nepal," says Basnet, adding that he plans to take Buddha Air to other major cities in the Asia Pacific region in future to better facilitate connectivity for passengers flying into and out of Nepal. Buddha Air currently employs more than 700 people, offering them salaries between 150 dollars and thousands of dollars per month. "They are a mostly happy bunch of people," he says. "We are like a happy family, but still we need to make sure that everyone is looked after and content." His recipe for success remains this: "Don't multi-task, focus on your goal. Success is floating around, all you have to do is go and grab it. But again, you have to focus on what you want to do and what you want to achieve." </body>

      <title>Cooking up a successful food business</title>
      <description>UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham talks about how he was inspired to set up his company, and how he grew it successfully.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24434154</url>
      <date>1381707185</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70398000/jpg/_70398329_vw.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Inspiration can often come from strange places. For UK ready meals boss Charlie Bigham it was being unable to sleep at the border between Iran and Pakistan. Mr Bigham was 28 years old at the time, and he and his then girlfriend were travelling from the UK to India by camper van. "It was very, very hot, and we were in a really tough place," he says. "I couldn't sleep, so I just laid there restlessly thinking about what I was going to do for a living when we got back home. "I decided there and then that I was going to set up a food business, and it was going to look a bit like this." Mr Bigham had previously worked as a management consultant in London, before he and his girlfriend quit their jobs to go travelling for nine months. His ambition was to set up his own company when they returned to the UK, and now he had his idea - he was going to establish a business that made upmarket ready meals. Mr Bigham was not going to let the fact that he had never worked in the food industry before put him off, and instead he decided he would quickly set about gaining the knowledge and skills he needed. And so upon his return to the UK he got a job at a delicatessen in London's fashionable Notting Hill area. "I've always been really interested in food, but I had no food industry experience, so I knew I had to get some cheese under my fingernails, so to speak," he says. He ended up spending almost four months at the deli, and at the same time did lots of research, and working on recipes. "It became clear that the idea of making meals which are then sold via shops was a very good idea for a business because it was a massive market, yet one which was very straightforward to start up in," says Mr Bigham. "I knew we could start under the radar before any bigger rivals could crush us, and then build quite quickly." In November 1996, 11 months after his return from travelling, and now married to his girlfriend, Mr Bigham launched the business with £25,000 of savings, calling it simply "Charlie Bigham's". To begin with, it was just him and one chef based at a small facility in London's Park Royal business estate. Mr Bigham says: "We had just three product lines to start with - zesty Caribbean lamb, Cajun chicken with salsa, and salmon with a dill and cream sauce. I think we made just 20 meals in total in that first week." To get sales moving, Mr Bigham, now 47, says he simply started "knocking on people's doors". "I went round all the posh delis in London, and the big department stores with food halls. Everyone was approachable, and said, 'Yeah we'll give you a go'. "I just had to be mildly persuasive, and I'm not a salesman. "What greatly helped us, is that you have to remember that at the time, most ready - or convenience - meals, as I prefer to call them, were pretty dreadful. "We were one of the first to make quality ones without anything artificial. This set us apart and made shops interested in stocking us." But while selling to posh stores in London was pleasing, Mr Bigham realised that in order to grow the business he needed to win a contract with one of the UK's supermarket groups. And so he cold-called Waitrose. "I just picked up the phone and rang the Waitrose switchboard. I managed to persuade a lovely woman on the phone to put me through to a buyer. I got a meeting, and the buyer said she would give us a go." Charlie Bigham's meals have been stocked by Waitrose ever since, initially at 40 stores for a successful trial period, and then nationwide. Online supermarket Ocado, and Booths, the north of England supermarket chain, have since followed suit. The company now employs 200 people across two sites at the Park Royal business park, and has an annual turnover of £20m, which is now growing at 19% per annum. Mr Bigham says his former job as a management consultant helped him manage the company's growth over the past 17 years. But he is the first to admit that luck and good timing played a major role in his success. "The only way you can ever set up a successful business is to be lucky," he says. "It is the thing you need more than anything else. Anyone who says otherwise is just lying." Mr Bigham says that most important piece of luck was all to do with timing. "I set up a food business just as interest in food was blossoming in this country. Suddenly there was a wealth of TV chefs, and the national newspapers all added food sections at weekends. "And the supermarkets were all being brave and looking outwards towards new suppliers. There was no planning or forethought about all this on my part, it was pure luck." Mr Bigham today gives himself the job title "chairman and creative director". This followed his decision back in 2010 to bring in someone else to handle the chief executive role. "It has enabled me to focus on the bits of the business I'm really interested in - product development, and the big strategic picture - working out plans for the next three to five years," he says. "The bit in the middle [the day-to-day financial decisions etc] I'm easily bored by, and is best done by someone else." Looking ahead, Mr Bigham says the company has no plans to start exporting, because the freshness, and therefore limited shelf life of his products, makes it too expensive. Nor does he ever intend to move production away from London to somewhere cheaper, because he says he is loyal to his hard-working staff. "I'm proud of what we have done to date, but I'm in no way complacent. Owning your own business is a hugely privileged position to be in, because I work with people I have chosen - not many people can say that." </body>

      <body>Italian football club Inter Milan has become the latest European club to be taken over by foreign investors. A trio of Indonesian businessmen led by media tycoon Erick Thohir have bought a 70% stake in the club. The club did not disclose the value of deal, but various reports estimated it to be between 250m - 300m euros ($340m; £210m - $405m; £250m). The two sides had been negotiating for some time amid efforts by the club to bring in fresh capital. Massimo Moratti, the president of the club, said the club's "history is going to be enriched by a new season thanks to our new international partners who, I am sure, will contribute to a continued string of successes". "The new partners' enthusiasm and pragmatism are certainly a guarantee for the future," he added in a statement. Mr Thohir is also a co-owner of DC United, a Major League Soccer club in the US and has also served as vice president of the Indonesian Olympic Committee. The other two partners in the deal are Rosan Roeslani and Handy Soetedjo. Mr Roeslani also owns a stake in DC United, while Mr Soetedjo was involved in the purchase of basketball team Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 2011. </body>

      <body>Cornish Pirates owner Dicky Evans has announced plans to step aside at the end of the season, but insists he will continue to help finance the team. The 67-year-old plans to sell 150 shares in the club and has committed to providing £400,000 in funding on a two-year rolling basis. The businessman has been involved at the Pirates since 1994. "We need to alter the ownership of the club in readiness for the next push as I'm not getting younger," said Evans. In a lengthy statement on the Cornish Pirates website,   Evans laid out his vision for the future of the club over the next few years and explained his decision to change the ownership model. "I have to think of my family for a change, four people who have been incredibly supportive of me," he added. "I intend to step aside, not down, at the end of the season as the owner of the company and hand over ownership to the many superb friends and supporters who follow the team. "Consequently, over the next eight months to the end of this current financial year we need to develop a plan to enable friends and supporters of the Cornish Pirates worldwide to take ownership through a basic share issue format. "They will be taking over a company clear of all loans and debt - paying a nominal £1 for the whole shareholding." The Pirates have risen up the leagues to the Championship during Evans' time at the club, but have so far found the ultimate prize of a place in the Premiership frustratingly out of reach. Evans said the need to move to a stadium in a more central location in Cornwall - ideally in Truro - was a key hurdle for the club to clear in order to progress and increase their fanbase. The pursuit of a larger stadium in Truro has been a long-running issue for the Pirates, who are currently based at Mennaye Field in Penzance in the far south-west of the county. The club have led a nomadic existence in recent seasons having played at Kenwyn near Truro and at Camborne during the last decade. "This is the next major step in securing our future," added Evans. "The stadium will come eventually and it's essential that the Cornish Pirates are in a position to move to the centre of Cornwall and consolidate on the business and spectator support available there, witnessed by the year we spent at Kenwyn - our most successful year at this level financially. "The rugby will be of the highest calibre possible within the budget constraints that are always with us and the party atmosphere will continue both home and away. "Cornish people deserve a top-class sporting team and venue - we have the ability to produce the former and as each obstacle to a stadium is surmounted there is no doubt that will come. "The Pirates are a vital part of this dream - let's not let it go down the tubes." Evans also plans to offer some "iconic players" and coaches Ian Davies and Harvey Biljon long-term contracts until the end of the 2015-16 season as part of a commitment to working closely with the wider Cornish rugby community. "Hopefully we can work with the senior Cornish clubs such as Redruth and Launceston to provide our qualified coaches on an almost full-time basis," he said. "At the same time we can work with these clubs to lend them Pirates squad players. "And there is no reason why other players with coaching qualifications cannot work with other Cornish clubs at no salary cost to that club. "We have a deep squad this year and will continue to target all competitions. Once we have decided and agreed which players we think will make the grade we will commence negotiations and we will be cutting our cloth to suit. "Our budget funds next season should be sufficient to enable us retain a very competitive side." </body>

      <title>Rangers forced to postpone their AGM</title>
      <description>Rangers' annual meeting is delayed after shareholders seeking changes to the club's board won a court decision.</description>

      <body>Rangers have been forced to postpone their 24 October annual meeting after shareholders seeking changes at board level won a court decision. Lord Tyre granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session in Edinburgh, preventing the AGM from going ahead. Rangers had said there was not enough time for four directors nominated by shareholders to be put up for election. But the group said Rangers had broken the law by failing to ensure the motion was on the agenda. It is the latest development in a battle for control of the Scottish League One leaders. The group wants Malcolm Murray, who was club chairman until April, Paul Murray, who was a director until last year, director of Loch Lomond Golf Club Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson, a former HR director with BT, to be appointed to the board. Paul Murray told BBC Scotland's Sportsound programme : "Today was all about shareholder democracy. We wanted to put in front of the shareholders, the fans and the other stakeholders of the club the ability to have a democratic vote at the AGM. "We submitted four nominations on 27 September. Those have been shown today to have been perfectly valid legal notices. "The club's board chose to ignore those notices and issue an AGM notice that is flawed and set a date of 24 October that is now having to be rearranged." "I think both [chief executive] Craig Mather and [finance director] Brian Stockbridge have to seriously consider their positions tonight because I think they are untenable. "The board chose to tie us up in all sorts of legal mechanisms that were reported today in court and we've been vindicated." Richard Keen QC, representing the shareholder group, accused the club of engaging in "guerrilla warfare" in its battle to prevent a group of shareholders from joining the Ibrox board. He told Lord Tyre the directors of the club had "committed an offence" by not informing other shareholders of the requisition. "An offence has been committed by every member of this board," Keen said. "The board have placed themselves in a very difficult situation by failing to discharge their statutory obligations. They have committed an offence. "If I am right, the consequences of that must be visited upon them." Mather and his fellow board members have been sued by the requisitioners. The current Rangers board has so far blocked the attempts at change, claiming the application was not properly authenticated and that it did not arrive on time. Keen claimed the signatures requested by the board had been offered "timeously" before adding: "These requests have been sent by the relevant companies and, on the face of it, there is no reason to doubt their validity." However, Heriot Currie QC, representing the board of Rangers International Football Club, told Lord Tyre: "The petitioners have known since 12 September that they had to organise themselves for a shareholder meeting by no later than 30 October." The Murrays, along with shareholders Ian Cormack, John Graham and Colin Howell, made requests in writing to Rangers International Football Club plc to give notice to members of the resolutions to appoint new directors at the AGM on 27 September. They maintained they had enough support from institutional shareholders to take them over the key threshold of 5% of the total voting rights to allow such a move. Currie said there was no obligation on the part of the company to circulate the resolutions and claimed documents and related information were supplied that at the very least raised "very significant doubt" over three of the backers of the move making valid requisitions. Rangers must re-arrange their AGM to be held before the end of December and must give shareholders at least 21 days' notice. They say they will fix a new date "as soon as possible" with the requisitioners' business included, but they have defended their decision to initially oppose the notices. Following the Court of Session decision, Rangers issued a statement on their website  : "The board of directors of the company received clear and firm advice from its solicitors and senior and junior counsel that on the face of documents provided by the petitioners, the notices had not been signed in a manner that was authorised and as a result the directors were obliged to seek further clarification from those shareholders. "Every effort was made to engage with the petitioners on these issues. However, the petitioners chose to resolve the matter in court. In Lord Tyre's opinion, these irregularities did not invalidate the notices." </body>

A dispute about pay and pensions has caused the closure and owners Ineos say they are being held to ransom by the union. The union says the company is behaving badly. Tom Crotty, a director of Ineos, told the Today programme: "The reason we had the plant closed is that Unite served notice that they were going to strike, which they then called off.

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <title>Are markets 'efficient' or irrational?</title>
      <description>The joint Nobel winners who fundamentally disagree</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24579616</url>

      <body>Two economists with diametrically opposing interpretations of the way markets behave have been jointly awarded the 2013 Nobel memorial prize for economics. Why? This story begins way back at the start of the 20th Century, in Paris. Louis Bachelier, aspiring physicist, lives a life filled with misfortune. His parents die suddenly, leaving him holding his baby brother. He's not free to enter university until he's too old to be admitted. He takes night classes instead, producing one of Einstein's famous results before Einstein does - and he's all but laughed out of academia. But in 1900, Bachelier publishes work that, long after his death, will be recognised as ground-breaking. His remarkable idea is that the price of government bonds follow a random course - each new movement in the price will be unpredictable. At first sight it's an odd idea. Why would the performance of a financial asset be random? But Bachelier understood that if it was obvious that a share or a bond would be worth more next week, then the price should already have risen in anticipation of that. Predictable moves have already happened, because the market is efficient - and all that is left are unpredictable surprises. In the economics department of the University of Chicago in the 1960s, student Eugene Fama knew Louis Bachelier's theory well, but wasn't satisfied. "It dawned on me that that statement wasn't enough," he says. "There's no economical model behind that." And so Fama went to work, and ended up demonstrating that stock markets are indeed efficient. If you are an investor, one important consequence of an efficient market is that there's no point trying to make a killing. The market will always be one step ahead of you. Better to invest broadly rather than believing in some get-rich-quick scheme. Fama himself has, in fact, found some ways to beat the market - or at least, investment strategies that would have beaten the market in the past. But he concludes nonetheless that for practical investment purposes, people might as well behave as though markets are efficient, and that nothing is therefore underpriced. "Because if they are inefficient it's very difficult to tell how, when and where, and the evidence suggests that supposed experts aren't very good at it," he says. "People spend lots of money trying to hire managers that can pick stocks, although the evidence says quite conclusively that that is probably impossible to do." So the market is always right. Or is it? A decade later, a challenger to the efficient markets hypothesis arrives on the scene - Robert Shiller, now at Yale, then at MIT. He wrote a paper making a statistical case that market volatility is too high for the efficient markets theory to be true. His idea was that markets have a tendency to overreact to news, or to react to non-news. "This got me into a huge controversy then," he recalls. "I was wondering why do people get so emotional about this? I'm just saying something that's common sense and obvious - these markets aren't perfect." And this argument doesn't stay in academic circles. It makes it into the heart of real world economics. In 1996 Robert Shiller is invited to lunch with the chairman of the US Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan. "I asked the table, 'When was the last time a Fed chairman had said that he thought that the stock market was overpriced?'" The answer came that it was about 30 years ago. "So I said to Greenspan, 'Maybe you ought to consider making a statement about the overpricing of the market?'" Just a few days later the Federal Reserve Chairman made a speech that has become famous. "How do we know when irrational exuberance has unduly escalated asset values which then become subject to unexpected and prolonged contractions as they have in Japan over the past decade?" he said. Having prodded Alan Greenspan into action, Shiller went on to write a best-selling book called Irrational Exuberance, and he's famous for saying in the late 1990s that shares were hugely overvalued - and they did crash not long after - and for saying in 2005 that US house prices were overvalued. And they crashed too. Was he just lucky? What were his reasons for pointing to a bubble? Well, stock analysts commonly looked at how company profits, or earnings, compared to their share price. What Shiller and his colleague John Campbell had decided to do was take a longer-term view of this price-earnings ratio. They compared the share price to the average earnings for the past 10 years. This long-term price-earnings ratio showed a sharp peak in 1929, just before the great Wall Street crash. And the peak in the late 1990s was even bigger. So why don't we see these irrational booms at the time? "I think it's because a lot of people benefit by seeing the boom continue," Shiller says. "And there's a sense that no-one should shout 'Fire!' in a crowded theatre - everything's going great, right? Earnings are going up, prices are going up." But Eugene Fama isn't convinced that it's quite so easy to spot trouble in financial markets. "The notion that for example regulators should somehow go in and burst bubbles is to me a joke," he says. "I don't think anybody really recognises bubbles - I mean I don't even like the word - apart from in 20/20 hindsight." In Gene Fama's view, when technology stocks boomed in the late 1990s, and then crashed, that reflected people's views about the prospects of highly successful companies emerging from the melee. Not quite enough of them did, to sustain share prices at that level. But that didn't make the market irrational, it just made it wrong - with hindsight. We shouldn't overlook Lars Peter Hansen. He was the third Nobel prize winner, for developing statistical tools that are now hugely influential in economics - especially in the study of financial markets. But we wouldn't be human if we weren't curious about the apparent contradiction in awarding shares of the Nobel prize to Eugene Fama for showing that the market is efficient, and Robert Shiller for showing that it isn't. Is the committee just hedging its bets? Both will get a mention in the history books as having contributed to the future development of economic thought, in Shiller's view. "It's a little bit like religion," he says. "I mean there are all these different sects and if you look at them in the whole it doesn't seem to make any sense - they contradict each other so fundamentally. But maybe there's some wisdom about living that comes out of all of them. And I think that the economics profession isn't as fragmented as it may seem." But was it not a little irritating to share the Nobel memorial prize with someone who seems to contradict you? "I think there is rule for substantial disagreement and I think all points of view - all interpretations of the evidence - should get a full airing," Fama says. "I mean, all of that makes the world a much more interesting place, and I was thrilled that Bob got it." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>As Abba once sang so wistfully, breaking up is never easy. But when Benny and the band reflected on the passing memories and the tears, they forgot to mention the practical dilemmas faced by separating couples: how to divide the money, and what to do about the children. And in the last six months sorting out those issues has got even harder. Dozens of centres designed to help couples split up amicably are in danger of closure. Indeed some are already in the process of shutting their doors. The closures are an unintended consequence of cuts to the legal aid system, which the government introduced in April. Since then mediators have seen far fewer couples coming through their doors. In May last year 2,800 couples attended sessions, according to the government. By May this year that had more than halved to 1,200. For most people, mediation is a much less stressful process than going to court. It is also cheaper. The mediator will take it for granted that the couple is splitting up, so his or her job is simply to help divide the financial assets, and arrange access to the children. Lawyers are not involved. "It gets sorted a lot quicker. You both still have your say. And there are no arguments," says 23 year-old Sinead Harris from Guildford in Surrey. She spilt from her partner earlier this year, and needed help with arranging access to her two year-old son. "Going through the courts would have meant more stress and more arguments," she says, "which is not good for a child to be around." So why are fewer people using the service? Since April, most couples no longer qualify for legal aid for divorce or separation. When they did receive legal aid, lawyers would often refer them on to mediators. Now that process no longer happens. "Because there's no legal aid, people don't look at mediation," says Eileen Pereira, of National Family Mediation. "Ours has become a hidden service," she adds. Eight mediation services, including some based in Sussex, Wiltshire, Hertfordshire and Lancashire, have already announced their intention to close. Eileen Pereira believes three or four times that number are also under threat. If the closures continue she worries that many more families will be forced to use lawyers instead. "That means they will be spending more," she says. "But also the emotional impact on the family will be much greater because the families will not be supported through this process." The government, which had hoped the legal aid changes might actually encourage more people to use mediation, has been taken by surprise by the fall-off in demand. Lord McNally, the Families Justice Minister, admitted that it was a "hiccup". "We've noticed the dip," he told the BBC. "We're looking at how we can address the issue, and hope to help them promote more mediation more vigorously in the future," he said. But in the meantime much of the £25m set aside as legal aid for mediation has remained unspent. From April 2014, a new law will require those separating in the courts to at least have tried mediation. The government believes that will re-invigorate demand for the services. National Family Mediation, which represents mediation services around the country, cannot be certain how many services will still be in existence by then. In the meantime the government is doing its best to encourage people to go ahead and find a mediator themselves, without being referred by a lawyer. Couples can go via a Ministry of Justice website to locate a mediator based near them, or via National Family Mediation. Those interested are also being reminded that in many cases legal aid is available. Anyone with income below £31,884 might be eligible, depending on some property-owning criteria as well. In addition the government has produced a video, to give people further advice. When they sang, Knowing me, knowing you, Abba also suggested, "There is nothing we can do." However, that is a sentiment that advocates of mediation might well challenge. Even though some break-ups are inevitable, there are ways in which the practicalities, and the costs, of separation can be made more tolerable. </body>

      <title>Energy bills: Where does my money go?</title>
      <description>Where does my money go?</description>

      <body>Ed Miliband has pledged that gas and electricity bills will not go up for 20 months if Labour wins the 2015 election. The promise, made in his speech at the party's annual conference, has stoked up a debate over energy prices and their justification. So where exactly does customers' money go and what might be the effect of a price freeze? How much do we pay? The average annual dual-fuel bill - covering gas and electricity - is £1,315 per household. This figure, published by regulator Ofgem in mid-September, is based on the latest assumption of the amount of energy a typical household uses. Bear in mind, this is an average. The amount you pay depends on your energy consumption and the method of payment. It is one of the largest regular bills that a household has to pay, behind mortgage or rent, and council tax. Prices have risen in recent years, and analysts predict another increase in the coming weeks. Do people in other countries pay more or less? As with many aspects of this sector, the answer is not simple. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has had a crack at a comparison, but data for countries including Belgium, Italy and Sweden is unavailable. These figures show that average domestic electricity prices in the UK, including taxes, last year were the fourth lowest among 15 EU countries, and the fourth highest among the G7 group of nations. For gas, domestic prices in the UK in 2012 were the second lowest among the 15 EU counties that were compared, and the third lowest in the G7. Households in the US benefited from the lowest prices for both gas and electricity. How much of my bill ends up as the energy firms' profits? The argument over whether the major energy suppliers' profits are "excessive" is central to this debate. The regulator has been collecting data on these firms' profit margins for the past three years. The latest statistics, from mid-September, show that the average profit margin made on the £1,315 bill is £65. This was £30 higher than September 2011 and September 2012. However, it is worth bearing in mind that this is a snapshot and the figure has been volatile. In some months, the profit margin has risen above £100, whereas in others the margin has been negative. Ofgem says that seasonal factors are key to this volatility. Where does the rest of the money go? By far the biggest chunk of your bill goes on the cost of buying gas and electricity on the wholesale market, or directly from an electricity generator or gas supplier. This, in addition to the costs of running a retail business with billing and sales, accounts for 67% of a gas bill and 58% of an electricity bill, according to Ofgem. But this is where the figures get really complicated. Wholesale gas and electricity is not a single product but a whole series of contracts. Each company's team of traders will be buying energy at different prices, depending on whether this is delivered tomorrow, next month, or even in five years' time. They spread out the purchases of energy to mitigate the risk of volatility when, for example, there is unrest in an oil-producing region. OK, and what else does my bill cover? About 16% of it goes on distribution charges - the cost of the gas pipes and electricity wires that get the energy into your home. The cost of high pressure gas and high voltage transmission networks account for 2% of a gas bill and 4% of an electricity bill. VAT accounts for 5% of each. A bit goes on costs of metering and storing gas. Then, 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. It is these "green" fees that the energy suppliers say have pushed up the cost of a typical bill in recent years. What might be the effect of a price freeze? Some of the energy companies, and those who represent them, argue that the lights could go out if prices cannot be changed for nearly two years. In reality, we will not be plunged into darkness. What they mean is that the decommissioning of coal - and ultimately nuclear - power plants, is going to create a shortfall in energy production in the UK. If they are going to build new power production plants, such as wind farms or power stations, huge amounts of investment are needed. An inability to set prices would affect this long-term strategy. In response, Ed Miliband says that firms have been "overcharging" customers for many years. Consumer groups say a price freeze would be popular, but there would be hurdles in making such a policy work. Can the regulator step in if prices are pushed up ahead of the general election? No, Ofgem has no control of the prices that companies charge their customers. Instead, a supplier might find that it is undercut by other firms if it puts up prices significantly, leading customers to switch. If all firms do the same, this competition argument is weakened. However, Ed Miliband says he would take action if prices went up sharply before the election, if Labour formed the next government. What else might it mean for competition? It could affect new, smaller businesses trying to get into the market. They would be unable to change prices, leading to more volatility in terms of profits. Open4Energy, one of only a handful of new suppliers licensed by Ofgem, has already said that it would pull out of the UK if a price freeze looked like becoming policy. How can I save money on my bill now? There are various ways to save money on your energy bill, if you are a homeowner or a tenant. They include looking for better deals and switching suppliers if needs be, especially if you have been on the same tariff for a long time. Paying by direct debit, and receiving bills online can also reduce costs for those currently paying by cheque every quarter. </body>

      <title>Why tech women need a makeover</title>
      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24537621</url>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Taiwan's older students</title>
      <description>Can the elderly save Taiwan's universities?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24566388</url>
      <date>1382051878</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70542000/jpg/_70542842_old.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Every night after dinner, many of Taiwan's older people go out to nearby parks to chat with their neighbours, or stay home to watch TV and play with the grandchildren - but not 62-year-old Yu Chin-shan. He takes his briefcase full of books and notebooks, and goes to college. The semi-retired Mr Yu owns an IT services company and has been a boss for 20 years. But now he wants to fulfil a dream he couldn't afford when he was younger. "I didn't go to college when I was young because my family didn't have the money. So I started working and eventually started a business. But I found there were many things about business management that I still wanted to learn," said Mr Yu. He is among a new wave of older people going to college for either short-term classes or degrees as Taiwan's life expectancy increases and the population ages. In 2008, Taiwan's government began offering subsidised university courses for older people, as a way to help them live more active lives. At first, older people had to be persuaded to attend college. Now they bring their friends and travel from other cities to take classes ranging from healthcare to history and law. This year, 100 universities in Taiwan have offered these courses and the older student population has shot up from about 800 in 2008 to more than 3,000 today. This is happening as many of Taiwan's 160 universities are facing declining enrolment from younger students. At Taipei's China University of Science and Technology, the student population has dropped by several hundred this year. The university had 10,000 students a few years ago, but is now down to about 9,000. Universities, who must compete for the shrinking number of students, fear that some will have to close in the coming years if the trend continues. The university blames the decline on Taiwan's low birth rate. Many young people are delaying getting married, not marrying at all, or are having fewer children or none at all. Meanwhile the island's universal health care system, which provides medical care to 99% of the population at relatively low costs for patients, is also improving health and prolonging the lives of Taiwan's people. The average lifespan in Taiwan has reached 80 years. As early as 2016, Taiwan's 65-and-overs will outnumber those under the age of 14 for the first time. By 2060, four in every 10 people on the island will be 65 or older. Tien Chen-jung, president of the China University of Science and Technology, says some institutions, including his own, are hoping to attract more older students - many of whom never had the chance to go to college, or even secondary school back in the days when Taiwan was still a developing economy. "We feel this is a huge market," Mr Tien said. "Many elderly people don't want to just stay at home all day. They have a thirst to learn. We've found that with the right programmes and good teachers, they are very happy to take classes here, and we believe they will even pay full tuition to get a degree." Enrolment among older people has increased by about 25% a year over the past few years, with nearly 1,000 enrolling last year. After taking the subsidised classes, Mr Yu became even more interested in learning. This year, he enrolled for a degree in enterprise management. "Some people might think it's too late for me to go to college, but I think it's never too late to learn. I believe in the saying, 'Live until we reach old age, learn even after we've reached old age,'" he said. "I think lifelong learning is very important. It keeps our mind active and strong." For his bachelor degree programme, Mr Yu even has to take general education courses, like his younger classmates. That includes sports. In a school gymnasium full of young students playing table tennis one night, he's clearly the only one with gray hair. But although he hasn't played in 40 years, he returns his opponent's serves almost every time. He's not only keeping up in this and other classes, he's doing better than some of his younger classmates. That's perhaps a sign of what's to come, for Taiwan's rapidly ageing society. </body>

      <description>Rwanda targets knowledge economy with tech revolution</description>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>How bad are US debt levels?</title>
      <description>How does the US compare with other major economies?</description>

      <body>Taken out of context, the numbers are staggering. The US has a total debt pile of almost $17 trillion (£10.6 trillion), which is expected to rise to almost $23tn in the next five years. But how does that compare with other major economies? Japan is not far behind, with current debts totalling $11.5tn. By any standards, these are big, big numbers. And these countries are not alone - almost every major global economy has debts of more than a trillion dollars, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). But context is needed - after all, debt is not necessarily a problem if you have the income to cover it. That is why the two most common measures used to gauge a nation's indebtedness are: Some governments actually run a surplus - in other words their income exceeds their expenses. Running a surplus is one of the best ways to reduce overall levels of debt. Looking at debt-to-GDP tells us that total US debt is roughly equivalent to its annual economic output. It is by far the largest economy in the world, and has the largest debt pile. Japan is the world's third largest economy, but its huge pile of debt is more than double its GDP. The only other country whose debts outstrip economic output is Italy, although a number of others come close - namely the UK, France and Canada. Even Germany, traditionally seen as fiscally responsible, has a debt-to-GDP ratio of more than 80%. Much of this debt has been accumulated over the long term, but the numbers have rocketed in recent years as governments have struggled to cope with the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent recessions that have ravaged almost all major economies. Banking bailouts, economic stimulus measures and falling tax revenues have all forced governments to borrow more. For example, in 2007, the UK's debt pile was just 44% of GDP compared with 88% last year. This reflects in part the country's large financial sector relative to its overall economy. The US's debt-to-GDP ratio in 2007 was 64%, the same as France and Germany. By contrast, the debt-to-GDP ratio in China and India, which have seen economic slowdowns but no recession, has not moved significantly over the past five years, nor is it set to deteriorate in the next five. Indeed in the case of China, it is set to fall significantly. The picture elsewhere is less encouraging. The IMF estimates that Germany aside, those countries with high levels of indebtedness will struggle to reduce debt levels in the coming years. The UK, where the government has made much of reducing debt levels, will actually see the debt ratio edge towards 100% of GDP. One reason for this is governments' inability to move from an annual deficit to a surplus. In other words, an inability to live within their means. The IMF estimates that only Australia and China of the world's 12 largest economies will move into surplus by 2018, while Germany will increase its surplus further. Russia, it thinks, will move from a surplus to a deficit. However, most major economies are expected to make good progress in reducing their deficits. </body>

      <title>Impact of a Royal Mail strike?</title>
      <description>Contingencies and opportunity during a postal strike</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24551650</url>
      <date>1381941928</date>

      <body>A nationwide strike of Royal Mail workers is to go ahead, says the Communication Workers Union, after its members voted four-to-one in favour of industrial action. The last time national strikes by postal workers were seen in the UK was in 2009, when a series of walkouts led to widespread disruption. It was estimated that in the first wave of nationwide strikes in 2009, there was a backlog of 30-60 million pieces of post. In the second wave, the backlog was of more than 50 million. It was also reported that some businesses suffered heavy losses, orders were unfulfilled, staff were unpaid, and some were even laid off. So what will the impact be now, in 2013? The context of the postal service has changed. In the past four years competition has boomed, and while any disruption to the six-day-a-week universal service will be unwelcome to many, this time a lot of businesses have already made other plans. Federation of Small Businesses national chairman John Allan is urging his members to start preparing now to avoid a hit on their revenues. "We would encourage businesses to look at contingency plans," he says. "Ultimately, those firms reliant on using the postal service to deliver goods will be put at a disadvantage, with consequential negative impact on their bottom lines." A glance at the websites of online retail giants such as Asos will reveal statements reassuring customers that in the event of a strike, parcels will be directed to other service providers. Amazon, the Royal Mail's biggest single business customer, said in a statement on Wednesday: "If one of our carriers was unable to provide delivery services at any time, we would employ contingency plans which include routing orders through our other carriers." These other carriers have boomed in the past few years - from UK Mail to TNT, DX Exchange, and the likes of Hermes and Yodel. Some of Royal Mail's competitors were even established, says former postal regulator executive Stephen Gibson, of SLG Economics, because of previous industrial action. "The difference really between the strikes of the recent past and now is that there is more competition now," he says. "Previous strikes became a market opportunity for companies, and after winning that business, they've kept it." David Stubbs, a postal economist, agrees that a lot has changed in the world of deliveries since 2009. He says that competitors have proved themselves reliable, especially for businesses who were reliant on the Royal Mail, such as many eBay companies. However, he says, for smaller companies, strikes could cause real problems, especially given the timing. "If there were to be more strikes, leading up to Christmas, there would be real issues," he says. "Royal Mail processes almost double the volume in December over a normal month. "For the big retailers, they will have already got other plans in place, and they will have contracts with competitor companies. However, it will be disruptive. Those competitors are already straining with deliveries." He adds that some services, such as TNT, may look to expand their network. "There is a potential that alternative postal companies may expand their end-to-end delivery networks - TNT might try and deliver more to the home," he says. "But there is some uncertainty around what Ofcom [which regulates the sector] would do in that situation - the regulator has threatened to impose universal service conditions on competing mail providers." Andrew Starkey, the head of e-logistics at IMRG, the body that represents the UK's online retailers says that more choice in service has also been matched by a surge in the volume of parcels delivered, so taking on more business contracts will be a problem. "Royal Mail has been the default carrier of choice along with the post office network while the online shopping sector has developed, and though more competition has come into the market, there is also a lot more volume," he says. He says that by the end of 2013 there will be an estimated 1.24 billion online orders generated by UK retailers and eBay traders. "There are tens of millions more orders this year than last from online retails and Royal Mail carries about 50% of them," he says. That figure rises to 90% for returns, Mr Starkey adds. "If Royal Mail goes down everything creaks." Yet Mr Starkey says that the alternative network can cope with a one-day strike. "If it's more frequent, or a week-long stoppage, then that's a problem," he says. However, he and postal economist David Stubbs agree that the increasing popularity of "click and collect", whereby online orders are collected by the customer at a local shop, will ease congestion for parcel deliveries. Mr Starkey adds: "This came into its own in the very bad snow of 2010. It caught on from that point, and for small retailers who don't have this in their own stores, their networks have grown. "There are about 12,000 outlets now. That's about the same number as there are Post Offices anyway." </body>

      <description>Tributes are paid to Felix Dexter, the comedian and actor who rose to fame on sketch show The Real McCoy, who died on Friday.</description>

      <body>Friends have paid tribute to Felix Dexter, who died on Friday. The comedian and actor had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Reports said he was 52. Colleagues and peers used Twitter to praise the St Kitts-born Londoner, with comedian David Baddiel mourning a "real loss to comedy". He came to prominence in the flagship black comedy The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. Fellow comedian Sean Hughes wrote on Twitter: "So so sad to hear about the truly wonderful Felix Dexter passing away. "I hope you can feel the love in the comedy community fella. Rip." Bill Bailey wrote: "Very sad news about my old friend Felix Dexter. A brilliant comedian, a superb comic actor, a lovely man I feel privileged to have known." Once named Time Out comedian of the year, Dexter also featured in iconic BBC comedies The Fast Show and Absolutely Fabulous. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. His close friend, BBC Radio London presenter Eddie Nestor - who acted alongside Dexter for three years in The Real McCoy - told BBC Radio 5 Live: "It's a sad day. It's a really sad day. I went to see him and we talked and we laughed, and we laughed really hard. "This is somebody who's been diagnosed with a terminal illness and you find yourself laughing really hard, belly laughs." He added: "We've lost a talented, intelligent, articulate performer who could touch - who could reach out." Before entering comedy, Dexter studied law - something he said helped him deal with hecklers. He named Billy Connolly and the late American comics Richard Pryor and Bill Hicks among his influences, and remained on the stand-up circuit throughout his career. Later he featured in long-running staples Have I Got News You and Grumpy Old Men, as well as the influential Knowing Me Knowing You with Alan Partridge. As an actor, he had parts in Casualty and the Bill and appeared in the West End alongside Christian Slater. </body>

      <title>McCartney plays surprise London gig</title>
      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <title>Ejiofor defends slavery film scenes</title>
      <description>Chiwetel Ejiofor defends the harrowing scenes of violence in the film 12 Years a Slave, saying they were needed to be truthful to the story.</description>

      <body>Chiwetel Ejiofor has defended the harrowing scenes of violence in his new film 12 Years a Slave. The British actor plays a free black man from New York who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. "As an actor you have to slip down the rabbit hole and see what happens because there was no other way of telling the story," Ejiofor said. He was speaking before the film's European premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. The historical drama, from British director Steve McQueen, is already considered a leading contender for the Oscars. It contains several unflinching scenes in slaves are beaten and one where Ejiofor's character, Solomon Northup, is left hanging by a noose all day long, standing on tiptoes to stay alive. "I knew that [Steve] would go to all the places that you'd have to go to and that's what I wanted to tell the story," Ejiofor told a press conference in London on Friday. "It's a strange handicap if you can't talk about violence in a film about slavery. You are not going to do justice to any of the people involved. "I read into the script that there were obviously going to be these struggles and I wanted to embrace that." McQueen, whose films include Hunger and Shame, said that he had wanted to make a film about slavery and had been drawn to Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir, 12 Years a Slave. "The book is pretty extreme," he said. "My responsibility is this: either I'm making a film about slavery or I'm not. "If you make a film about slavery you have to understand why people were in bondage in this way for 400 years, through mental and physical torture." The film has been receiving rave reviews ever since its first screening at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado at the end of August. It won the People's Choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, which can be an indicator of Oscar success. The cast includes Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt. Earlier this week Fassbender was reported to have said he would not campaign for an Oscar nomination, despite being hotly tipped for his role as violent cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps. "It's just a grind. And I'm not a politician. I'm an actor," the actor told GQ magazine. Asked about Fassbender's comments, McQueen said: "He's an amazing artist. He's a force to be reckoned with." "His campaign is on that screen," he added. "He's done his thing - that's it." 12 Years A Slave is out in the UK in January 2014. </body>

      <title>Tennant's Richard II rules at RSC</title>
      <description>Early reviews note David Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair in Richard II in Stratford-upon-Avon.</description>

      <body>David Tennant's latest role sees him transformed into a king with flowing locks in the Royal Shakespeare Company's (RSC) Richard II. Early reviews have noted Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair. Richard II is the former Doctor Who star's first RSC role since his acclaimed Hamlet five years ago. Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <title>Philomena 'to fight R rating' in US</title>

      <body>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give his studio's latest film an R rating, according to reports. Philomena received the rating from the Classification and Ratings Administration for two instances of bad language. But the Weinstein Company will now officially appeal against the rating, The Hollywood Reporter said. The British Stephen Frears drama stars Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. The film is based on the 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith about Irish-Catholic woman Philomena Lee's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption decades earlier. The Weinstein Company plans to release the film in the US over the Thanksgiving period next month, however it has argued the R rating will affect the number of moviegoers who could potentially watch it. The restricted R rating means people under the age of 17 may only see the film if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the UK, it has been given a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification, where children younger than 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Weinstein's studio previously became embroiled in a row with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2012 over the documentary Bully over the use of bad language in the film. It opened in Los Angeles and New York without a rating, after the Weinstein Company chose to ignore the MPAA's original R rating. The studio eventually agreed to remove the language and an edited version of the film received a PG-13 rating. </body>

      <title>Row over Tony Blair 'selfie' artwork</title>
      <description>Two artists complain after advertising companies refuse to allow their photo montage of Tony Blair in front of a burning Iraq oilfield on billboards.</description>

      <body>Two artists who created a montage of Tony Blair apparently taking his own photo in front of a burning oilfield in Iraq have accused advertising firms of banning the artwork from billboards. Peter Kennard and Cat Phillips created the image, titled Photo Op, in 2005. It was chosen by the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester as the image for a poster campaign to promote a new exhibition about modern art and war. But two of the UK's biggest advertising companies refused to carry the image. Photo Op combines a picture of the grinning former prime minister taking a self-portrait on a mobile phone, originally from the 2005 general election campaign, with a separate image of a blazing oilfield during the Iraq war. It has previously been exhibited at Tate Britain and was recently described by The Guardian as "the definitive work of art about the Iraq war". It is now in the Imperial War Museum North's Catalyst exhibition and the museum had intended to use it on posters and billboards. But the artists, who go by the name kennardphillips, have accused advertising companies JCDecaux and CBS Outdoor of "political censorship" in refusing to carry it. The two firms controlled between 50%-70% of the outdoor advertising market in 2011, according to a government report. CBS Outdoor said the poster was refused after consultation with the Committee of Advertising Practice, which advises firms on whether ads may breach its code of conduct. Neither gave details of which part of the code it breached, but the code includes rules forbidding ads that are misleading and are likely to cause "serious or widespread offence". Kennard and Phillips said CBS Outdoor had told them they could not use images involving explosions on public transport, such as on the sides of buses. JCDecaux declined to comment. "It feels like you're not allowed to show anything that appears dissenting," Phillips said. "You get a lot of violence and sex in adverts and a lot of offensive things, but they're not critical in their offence. They're not creating an argument or a question mark. "It feels like if you have anything that is a real show of dissent, it wouldn't be allowed to go up there and there's very little you can do about it." The Catalyst exhibition opened at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) North in Manchester on Saturday. It is the museum's first major exhibition of war-inspired contemporary art inspired created since 1991. The museum's director Graham Boxer said "a number of outdoor advertising suppliers" refused to run the proposed poster campaign. He added: "IWM North aims to inspire discussion and debate about war and conflict and as such we have remained committed to using the kennardphillipps Photo Op image across other media, including on the website, in media coverage, on social media and of course in the exhibition." A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority, which operates the Committee of Advertising Practice, said the ad companies "would have been mindful of the advertising rules that require ads are prepared responsibly and do not contain anything that is likely to be misleading, harmful or offensive". </body>

      <title>Flynt: Don't execute man who shot me</title>
      <description>Porn publisher Larry Flynt says he does not want the man who put him in a wheelchair to face the death penalty.</description>

      <body>Porn publisher Larry Flynt has said he does not want the man who put him in a wheelchair to face the death penalty. Joseph Paul Franklin, who shot Flynt outside a Georgia court in 1978, is set for execution in Missouri in November. "I have every reason to be overjoyed with this decision, but I am not," he wrote in the Hollywood Reporter. "I would love an hour in a room with him... so I could inflict the same damage on him that he inflicted on me. But, I do not want to... see him die." White supremacist Franklin, who is being executed for killing Gerald Gordon outside a synagogue in 1977, has been convicted of a total of eight racially motivated murders across the US between 1977 and 1980. He confessed to, or was implicated in, 13 additional racial murders. No deterrent Franklin said he targeted Flynt after the publisher featured a black man and white woman in a photoshoot in Hustler, the magazine that formed the cornerstone of his adult entertainment business. "He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated all minorities," Flynt wrote. The entertainment mogul, who suffered permanent spinal cord damage, was left paralysed from the waist down after the shooting. The events were dramatised in the 1996 film The People vs Larry Flynt, starring Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love. "As far as the severity of punishment is concerned, to me, a life spent in a 3-by-6-foot cell is far harsher than the quick release of a lethal injection," wrote Flynt, 70, in a guest column this week. The publisher, who has never met Franklin face-to-face, says he does not believe the death penalty is a deterrent. "I have had many years in this wheelchair to think about this very topic," he wrote. "As I see it, the sole motivating factor behind the death penalty is vengeance, not justice, and I firmly believe that a government that forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of killing people itself." In a statement in August, Missouri attorney general Chris Koster said by setting an execution date of 20 November, the court had taken "an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families". </body>

      <title>Veep star 'would relish' drama roles</title>
      <description>US actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US sitcom Seinfeld and political satire Veep, says she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles.</description>

      <body>Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US satire Veep, has said she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles. "I would love to spread my wings in that direction, why not?" the multiple Emmy winner told the BBC ahead of the release of her new film Enough Said. The comedy, which had its UK premiere at this year's London Film Festival, tells of a divorcee who finds love just as her daughter is leaving for college. Louis-Dreyfus won her fourth Emmy last month for her role in Veep. Created by Armando Iannucci of The Thick of It fame, the HBO show sees her play an ineffectual US vice president whose attempts to expand her role are continually thwarted. Though ostensibly a romantic comedy, Enough Said - the fifth film by writer-director Nicole Holofcener - has "a couple of very dramatic moments" according to its 52-year-old star. "They were a great joy to do even if they were painful," the actress explained. "I hope my fans will be happily surprised." The film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September and is released in the UK on Friday, sees Louis-Dreyfus appear alongside James Gandolfini. The late star of The Sopranos plays Albert, a well-meaning man unaware his massage therapist girlfriend - the character Louis-Dreyfus plays - has taken on his vindictive ex-wife as a client. "I've never done anything as deceitful in my life but I understand why she does it," said the actress, who described her co-star as a "gentle giant" and a "dear, dear man". "This is a woman on the precipice who's been emotionally hijacked by herself. The dread and fear of her daughter's impending departure fuels this horrible thing she does." The scene in which her character's deception is exposed was both "tough" and "excruciating" to film, said the New Yorker, who is currently shooting the third season of Veep - a slang term for vice president. "But it was exciting to do something so dramatic about large human emotions." </body>

      <body>Canadian pianist Anton Kuerti has been taken to hospital after falling ill during a recital in Florida. According to eyewitnesses, Kuerti became disorientated and started repeatedly playing the same passage. "One of the audience members who's also a pianist actually went up to the stage to put his arm around him," said concert organiser Alan Penchansky. "He tried to find out what was wrong, and [Kuerti] started again. He simply was trapped," he told Canadian press. The fellow-musician, Santiago Rodriguez, a professor of keyboard performance at the Frost School of Music, eventually coaxed Kuerti off stage, and an intermission was called. During the intermission, Kuerti was seen by paramedics and taken to hospital by ambulance. He did not return. The Austrian-born pianist has been performing live almost all of his life - having first taken to the stage with the Boston Pops Orchestra at the age of 11. As a soloist, he has specialised in Beethoven, frequently playing the composer's entire cycle of 32 sonatas, and all five of his concertos. In 1997, US classical music magazine Fanfare called him "the best pianist currently playing", and he was an made an Officer of the Order of Canada the following year. BBC Radio 3 also named him one of the 50 Great Pianists in 2012. Now 75, he was performing at the Coral Gables Congregational Church in Miami when he was taken ill. Audience member Dorothy Hindman said the pianist "spoke intelligently and humorously" before the recital, which focussed on Beethoven's lesser-known works. He started playing Rondo in G major, Op 51, No 29 with an "exceptionally clear tone", she added, and his repetition of the closing theme was initially interpreted "as a private musical joke". But "Kuerti's growing disorientation and numerous stops and starts during the second of the Eleven Bagatelles, Op 119, signalled clearly to the large audience that something was terribly wrong". Writing in the South Florida Classical Review, Hindman said the stricken musician received a standing ovation as he left the stage. There was no further information on his condition at the time of writing. </body>

      <body>Liam Gallagher has said it was an easy decision to take part in a special concert in memory of The Charlatans' drummer Jon Brookes. Mr Brookes, 44, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour three years ago, died in August. The Charlatans will perform alongside other guests at the Royal Albert hall on Friday night in aid of The Brain Tumour Charity. Liam Gallagher described the musician as a "good lad". "He didn't have an ego, do you know what I mean? "I wouldn't claim to be his best mate and that. I only met him through the gigs we've done, but every time I met him I had a splendid time." Gallagher said he was on holiday at the time the concert was announced, but said he signed up straight away. He will be performing alongside fellow former Oasis band mates Andy Bell, Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs and Chris Sharrock, as well as Jay Mehler, currently part of Gallagher's band Beady Eye. West Midlands indie band The Charlatans said they organised the gig as a "fitting tribute" to founding member Mr Brookes, originally from Staffordshire. Keyboard player Tony Rogers said in some ways the event would be a tough night, when the reality of their friend's death "will hit home". "He was always very upbeat. His illness never got on top of him, he never let it get to him. He was always very positive and never moaned," Rogers said. "It's not like he's gone really. It's like his spirit is still there. It will be a tough one I think, but every time you think of Jon it puts a smile on your face." The Brain Tumour Charity's chairman Andy Foote said: "One of our biggest challenges is raising awareness of the disease, because the general public are not aware of the facts and they're quite startling. "For example, brain tumours kill more people under the age of 40 than any other cancer, yet less than 2% of funding that goes into cancer research goes into brain tumours." </body>

      <body>Gene Kelly film An American in Paris is being adapted for the stage and will premiere in Paris late next year. The 1951 film, notable for its score by George and Ira Gershwin, follows a GI falling in love in post-war Paris. The stage adaptation will include the famous 16-minute ballet sequence between Kelly and co-star Lesley Caron, reconceived by director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. The musical is expected to transfer to Broadway in 2015. The estates of the Gershwin brothers have been trying to develop a stage musical of An American in Paris for two decades, hoping to recreate the success of 1992's Tony-winning musical Crazy for You and last year's adaptation of Porgy and Bess. At their suggestion, US producer Stuart Oken and partner Van Kaplan have joined forces with Jean-Luc Choplin, of Paris' Theatre du Chatelet - where the musical will open - who was separately seeking the rights for a stage adaptation. "The Chatelet is more than a place to do the show," Mr Oken told the New York Times, "Though who wouldn't want to do An American in Paris in Paris, and to bring that feel to our show." Casting has yet to be announced. Wheeldon, a star at New York's City Ballet, previously created a ballet set to the music of the film for the company. The choreographer, who has never previously directed on Broadway, remains best known for his work on the 2002 musical adaptation Sweet Smell of Success. </body>

      <title>Mark Thompson recalled to face MPs</title>
      <description>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson is ordered to answer parliamentary questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped at a cost of £100m.</description>

      <body>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has been ordered to answer MPs' questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI). The project, which was designed to do away with tapes and digitise the BBC's archives, was abandoned in May at a cost of £98.4m The Public Accounts Committee said on Wednesday it was "dismayed" by the collapse and would investigate further. It intends to ask Mr Thompson whether MPs were misled about the scheme. The former director general told the committee in February 2011 the DMI project was "on track" and there were "many programmes being made" with it. He also ruled out any "significant further delays" in its introduction, and added: "I think you are going to see a broader deployment of the system across the BBC than we expected, because of the enthusiasm with which it is being used". Later that month, the National Audit Office reported DMI had "progressed well" after the BBC took control of the project from technology firm Siemens. However in May this year, the entire initiative was scrapped. The BBC Trust said it had "delivered little or no assets" and should be shut down to prevent "throwing good money after bad". "This is, on a personal level, probably the most seriously embarrassing thing I've ever seen," BBC Trustee Anthony Fry told the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in June. In a statement, Mr Thompson insisted his 2011 testimony had been given "honestly and in good faith". He added: "I did so on the basis of information provided to me at the time by the BBC executives responsible for delivering the project." No date has been set for his appearance in front of the committee, although the meeting will not take place until next year. It will be the second time he has been called to answer MPs questions since becoming chief executive of the New York Times, following his previous testimony on BBC management pay-offs in September. A spokesman for the committee said Mr Thompson was "happy to come and give evidence" again, although he may appear by video link if necessary - and that other witnesses would also be called. The BBC Trust has asked accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers to complete an independent review into the DMI failure. The National Audit Office may also compile a report next year. </body>

      <body>A bid to solve a £27m funding shortfall for the Bristol Arena has been given a major boost by neighbouring councils. City mayor George Ferguson previously requested support for a bid to cover the gap in the £90m proposal. North Somerset, South Gloucestershire and Bath and North East Somerset have said they will support the request for the money. A bid for the money will be made to the West's Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) board in December. Of the 11 board members, eight have voting power and half of those represent the four councils in the region. Chair of the LEP, Colin Skellett, said: "The City Deal always included the money to do the public investment in the arena and that hasn't changed. "Some of the numbers have changed and there's a discussion going on at the moment but I'm quite sure we'll get there." The LEP has already agreed to grant £25m of funding towards the project to build the 12,000-capacity arena after the government rejected a £40m bid earlier in the year. North Somerset Council's leader and LEP board member councillor Nigel Ashton said Bristol was "free to bid to for additional funding". "Any scheme will be assessed and, if approved, added to those already agreed. "We have a number of priority schemes already but we all support Bristol's ambition to build an arena." The arena is part of the city's plan to regenerate about 70 hectares (170 acres) of land surrounding Bristol Temple Meads station. Deputy mayor Geoff Gollop said he was "encouraged by the friendly response by our neighbouring authorities". He added that all four areas would "share the benefit of the wider economic impact of an arena, as well as having access to the biggest top flight bands and events currently denied us". </body>

      <title>Man Booker gets youngest winner</title>
      <description>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton becomes the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries, which is also the longest to win in the prize's history.</description>

      <body>New Zealand author Eleanor Catton has, at the age of 28, become the youngest ever winner of the £50,000 Man Booker Prize for her novel The Luminaries. Her 832-page tale of the 19th-century goldfields is also the longest work to win in the prize's 45-year history. "It's a dazzling work. It's a luminous work. It is vast without being sprawling," said Robert Macfarlane, chair of the judges. Catton was announced as the winner on Tuesday night at London's Guildhall. When her name was called out, "it almost seemed like the rest of the room ceased to exist," she told the BBC's World Update. Her book, a Victorian mystery tale set during the New Zealand gold rush, is intricately structured according to astrological charts - with each section exactly half the length of its predecessor. When it was shortlisted last month, the judges described it as a "Kiwi Twin Peaks". "You begin it and you think you are in the clutches of a big baggy monster," said Macfarlane on Tuesday, adding that what followed was an "accelerating, quickening tilt to the narrative". "We have returned to it three times now and we have dug into it - to use its own metaphors - and the yield it has offered at each new reading has been extraordinary," he said. The prize, announced live on the BBC News Channel, was presented this year by the Duchess of Cornwall. On receiving the award, Catton admitted that her lengthy, complex novel had been "a publisher's nightmare", saying she had been compelled to buy a bigger handbag to carry it around. She then thanked her publishers for striking the "elegant balance between making art and making money". The other authors on the shortlist were NoViolet Bulawayo, for We Need New Names; Jim Crace, for Harvest; Jhumpa Lahiri, for The Lowland; Ruth Ozeki, for A Tale for the Time Being; and Colm Toibin, for The Testament of Mary. Crace had been the bookies' favourite to win, with Catton reported to have a late surge of support over the weekend. Macfarlane said the judges' final decision had been made after "just under two hours of pretty tough discussion". Canadian-born Catton was raised in New Zealand and is the second writer from that country to win the prize. The first was Keri Hulme in 1985 with The Bone People - her first and only novel. The Luminaries is the longest ever Booker winner, beating Hilary Mantel's 672-page Wolf Hall which won in 2009. Macfarlane joked: "Those of us who didn't read it on e-readers enjoyed a full upper-body work-out." Set in 1866, The Luminaries begins with Walter Moody arriving to make his fortune on the New Zealand goldfields. He stumbles across a tense gathering of 12 local men, who have met in secret to discuss a series of unsolved crimes. Moody is then drawn into a mystery involving a missing wealthy man, a prostitute who has tried to end her life, and an enormous fortune which has been discovered in the home of a luckless drunk. Catton began writing the novel at the age of 25 and completed it when she was 27. She turned 28 last month. The previous youngest winner was Ben Okri, who was 32 when he won for The Famished Road in 1991. Kiran Desai was previously the youngest woman to win, at 35, with The Inheritance of Loss in 2006. "One can approach this as a murder mystery with seances, corpses, lawsuits and puzzles," said Macfarlane. "It does require investment… but it operates like the best kind of goldmine. You pan and then the yields are huge." Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles, said: "For those who are simply looking for a great story, the murder mystery at the heart of the book is thoroughly gripping and that alone should ensure very strong sales. "But there is so much more to it: a vivid cast of characters who leap from the page, a joyful celebration of language and some remarkable experiments with the underlying process of novel writing; critics who have dismissed it as a pastiche of 19th-century fiction have scarcely scratched the surface. "Catton is a writer of rare insight and intelligence, who is at the vanguard of the evolution of the novel. "I'm confident that she is destined to be one of the most important and influential writers of her generation." The six shortlisted writers each win £2,500 and are presented with a hand-bound edition of their book. As winner, Catton receives a further £50,000. This year marks the 45th year of the prize, which was won last year by Hilary Mantel for Bring Up the Bodies, the sequel to Wolf Hall. Next year the Man Booker Prize will be open to authors writing in English from all corners of the globe. It is currently awarded to English-language authors from the Commonwealth, including the UK, Ireland and Zimbabwe. The decision has split the literary establishment, with critics saying that American novelists will come to dominate the prize. </body>

      <title>Stoppard struggles to write play</title>
      <description>Award-winning writer Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, says he is finding it hard to remember how to write a stage play, as he attempts his first since 2006.</description>

      <body>Award-winning writer Sir Tom Stoppard, 76, has admitted struggling to remember how to write a play. He told The Times that he has found it hard to find time to focus on what will be his first stage play in seven years. "I can't just put things aside for a day and come back. My brain just isn't good enough anymore," said Sir Tom, whose career has also seen him write extensively for TV, radio and film. "I know what I want to do in the next six months. I don't know if I can." Sir Tom, whose radio play Darkside - inspired by Pink Floyd album The Dark Side of the Moon - was recently broadcast on BBC Radio 2, told the newspaper (subscription) that he was hoping to find a hideaway so that he could concentrate on writing. "When I was younger I could do something useful just by being free for half a day, but now I need five days to get the world I've left out of my head and ten days or a fortnight not talking to anyone to hold what I need to hold inside my head," he said. Sir Tom added: "I wish I could remember how to write a play. I can't remember how they happened." However the writer, who spent four years adapting Ford Madox Ford's book Parade's End for a BBC drama which aired last year, admitted taking on multiple projects could be to blame. "There are too many things I find it difficult to say no to," he said. "So I'm clearing the desk and planning to work without interruption." Sir Tom, who won an Oscar for the Shakespeare in Love screenplay he co-wrote with Marc Norman, also adapted Anna Karenina for the big screen last year. Breaking Bad He has written more than 30 plays for the stage, including The Real Thing and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead, and this latest untitled project would be his first since Rock'n'Roll in 2006. It is said to tackle "the intersection of science and metaphysics". Earlier this month, Sir Tom collected this year's Pen Pinter Prize at the British Library in London. It was established in 2009 in memory of playwright Harold Pinter, to be awarded to a writer who casts an "unflinching, unswerving" gaze upon the world and shows a "fierce intellectual determination...to define the real truth of our lives and our societies". But when asked about his long-term plans, Sir Tom joked that it involved "a very protracted deathbed in which I watch Breaking Bad and all the box sets people keep talking about." </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science-fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($13,000; £8,000). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced. Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo. Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure. He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard. Released under the title of The Mean Machine in the UK, Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football. He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler. The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976. Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve. The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars. Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!" He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones. His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy. Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures. He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'" Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production. A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors. His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation. </body>

      <body>US filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have received France's highest cultural honour at a ceremony in Paris. The brothers, who won three Oscars in 2008 for their crime drama No Country For Old Men, were each made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters. Accepting the award, Joel said: "Sometimes life plays jokes on you - some of them are very unfortunate, some of them are very fortunate. "This is one of the most fortunate jokes I think life has played on us." The award is given by the French government to people who "significantly contributed to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance". Eight of the Coen's films have premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, with 1991's Barton Fink winning the Palme d'Or. Their latest film, Inside Llewyn Davis, also won the Grand Prize of the jury at this year's festival. Released in the UK next January and starring Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake, the film tells the story of a struggling singer-songwriter against the backdrop of the 1960s New York folk scene. French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, who presented the honour to the pair, said: "We have extremely strong links between French cinema and American cinema so it's natural there's this recognition for two of the greatest directors in the US today." Other recent recipients of the honour from the world of film and music include Ringo Starr, Bono and Bruce Willis. </body>

      <description>Child abduction thriller Prisoners holds on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million.</description>

      <body>Child abduction thriller Prisoners has held on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million. The Hugh Jackman movie remained the UK's number one picture for the third week in succession, despite making only £968,990 between Friday and Sunday. Its takings were almost twice that of WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, which opened in a disappointing sixth place. The film made £502,495 in its first three days in UK and Ireland cinemas. Previews of animated movie Turbo, not included in this week's chart, are understood to have taken more than any title in the official Top 15. The DreamWorks release officially opens in the UK on Thursday and will have its preview takings added to its first weekend tally. The lacklustre landscape allowed Edinburgh-based musical Sunshine on Leith to claim second place in this week's chart after opening last week at three. Dexter Fletcher's film, which features songs by Scottish sibling duo The Proclaimers, took £732,296 in its second weekend on release. Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is ranked at number three with a third weekend tally of £642,241. The film, which boasts an Oscar-tipped performance by Cate Blanchett, has now made £3.33m, making it Allen's most profitable title ever at the UK and Ireland box office. With Filth at four and Rush at five, The Fifth Estate held the dubious honour of being this week's highest new entry. This is despite a major promotional push and the presence of Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Its failure to woo UK audiences was further underlined by the performance of marital drama Le Week-End at number seven. On a screen-for-screen basis, Roger Michell's film - which stars Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan as a long-married couple spending a weekend in Paris - made more than twice as much as its tech-savvy rival. Further down the chart, action sequel Machete Kills languished in 12th place with a three-day tally of £165,586. Its takings were only marginally superior to those recorded by Romeo and Juliet, an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, whose £137,448 tally saw it open outside this week's Top 15. </body>

      <body>Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s. The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the "pride of the pipsqueakery". The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been "brutally drab". And he accused music paper NME of being out to "get Morrissey" in the 1990s. The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994. He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and "steps inside and stays for two years". "For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone," he wrote. He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a "mewling miniature monster" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an "uncluttered commitment". Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of "constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue" in court. The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together. The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an "unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths". "The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!" Morrissey wrote. Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey. When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr "pinned him to the swivel chair". Travis, Morrissey drily noted, "would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed "saved his life and made it count in the long run". The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and "allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'". In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: "Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?" The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was "Kafka-esque in its nightmare". One teacher, he recounted, "stands and stares and stands and stares" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over. "At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine," Morrissey wrote. The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as "a last-minute content disagreement". </body>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported. Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn. However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported. He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour. "The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said. "I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him. "So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now." Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month. "I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added. The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week. In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal. It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time. </body>

      <title>South Park shut down by power cut</title>
      <description>Comedy Central is forced to repeat an old episode of the cartoon South Park after a power cut prevented this week's scheduled episode from being completed.</description>

      <body>Comedy Central was forced to repeat an old episode of South Park after a power cut prevented this week's scheduled episode from being finished. Computers at South Park Studios in Los Angeles were down for three hours on Tuesday, halting work on the episode Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers. Co-creator Trey Parker told fans "it sucks" but admitted it was inevitable. "After all these years of tempting fate by delivering the show last minute, I guess it was bound to happen," he said. It is the first time he and Matt Stone have missed one of their tight deadlines in 16 years, after famously starting each show from scratch just six days before it is due to air. Most animated TV shows are written several months in advance, but South Park's creators hope to keep the show current and fresh by working to a tight deadline. The US office of Comedy Central said in a statement on Wednesday: "From animation to rendering to editing and sound, all of their computers were down for hours and they were unable to finish episode 1704, Goth Kids 3: Dawn of the Posers, in time for air tonight." The planned episode was replaced with a repeat of Scott Tenorman Must Die, an episode featuring British band Radiohead, which fans had voted their second favourite of all time in a poll in 2011. The team posted pictures of the blackout on the show's Twitter feed and revealed that Goth Kids 3 was now scheduled for next week. Earlier this year Parker and Stone's musical The Book of Mormon opened to rave reviews in London's West End, after a sell-out debut on Broadway. They confirmed two years ago that they would continue animating the adventures of South Park's Stan, Kyle, Kenny and Cartman until 2016. The show recently kicked off its 17th series in the US to its highest ratings since 2011, with 4.3 million viewers tuning in across three broadcasts. The taboo-breaking animation is broadcast on Comedy Central in the UK at a week's delay and Goth Kids 3 is now expected to air on 30 October at 22:00 BST. Scott Tenorman Must Die will be broadcast in its original slot on 23 October. </body>

      <title>Stage revival of film giant Laughton</title>
      <description>The Thick of It star on spin doctors and screen legends</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24580390</url>
      <date>1382165743</date>

      <body>He made his name as an insufferable spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It and a plain-speaking manager in the BBC's Twenty Twelve. Now actor Vincent Franklin is on stage portraying one of Britain's greatest film stars, Charles Laughton. The legend of Charles Laughton has faded in the 50 years since his death, but the actor was among Britain's first Hollywood superstars, a giant of the silver screen from the 1930s onwards. Whether playing Henry VIII - a role that won him an Oscar in 1934 - or Rembrandt, Captain Bligh or Quasimodo, he was regarded by many as the greatest character actor of his age. "I certainly felt very excited about the idea of playing Laughton when I was asked to do it," explains Vincent Franklin. "Then within a week of being asked, when I'd started to read some books, I thought, this is the most arrogant thing I've ever agreed to do. "If somebody said to an actor, 'Do you want to play Laurence Olivier? Do you want to play Gielgud? Do you want to play De Niro?' you'd go, 'No I'm not going to play De Niro. Unless you're as good as De Niro how can you possibly play De Niro?' "But somehow I'd foolishly gone, 'Yeah, I'll play Charles Laughton.'" Laughton was born in the Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough and it is in the actor's home town that Franklin is bringing the Laughton legend back to life. A private and insecure person, Laughton never gave interviews. In the play, Franklin attempts to peel back the screen persona to reveal the real man. "He was an extraordinary lost soul," Franklin says. "As a fat, bald, northern actor myself, the idea that you can be an actor is fine. "But the idea that a man who is by his own [admission] an ugly man can become a film star is quite extraordinary. "On the surface of it, he's an extraordinary, successful human being. But on the inside it's a man who struggled with his own religious beliefs, struggled with his sexuality and struggled with self-loathing while at the same time being a true artist." The play, titled Laughton, is at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre, which was run by Alan Ayckbourn for 37 years. On display in the foyer is a photograph of Laughton, the guest of honour when the building was opened as a cinema in 1936. Franklin, from Bradford, was most recently seen playing Labour whip Michael Cocks in the National Theatre's 1970s political drama This House. But he is most recognisable from his TV roles as the no-nonsense head of contracts Nick Jowett in Olympic spoof Twenty Twelve and the all-nonsense Conservative PR guru Stewart Pearson in The Thick of It. The insufferably smug Pearson likes nothing better than to "imagineer the narrative" or "take a few turns on the ideas carousel". The Thick of It looks to be on indefinite recess now that Peter Capaldi, who played Pearson's expletive-slinging nemesis Malcolm Tucker, has been cast as Doctor Who. Writer Armando Iannucci recently said the show "has quietly been put in its box". "There's room for some specials," Franklin believes. "Whether Malcolm Tucker will be able to come back from Alpha Centauri or wherever he's been taken in the Tardis I don't know, but I hope so. "I regularly meet some people from it and there is a real sense of, 'It would be nice to do one more, wouldn't it?'" Unusually for an actor, Franklin also has a real job - a decade ago, he founded a company called Quietroom, which advises companies and government departments on how to communicate clearly. In that capacity, he is the anti-Stewart Pearson. "We improvise quite a lot of The Thick of It and quite a lot of what I do is the exact opposite of what I would tell someone to do [at Quietroom]," he says. For someone who advises people how to communicate, Franklin is suitably conscious of his choice of words as an interviewee. At one point he warns, "I'm just going to ramble for a moment now" and regularly checks: "Does that make sense?" When Quietroom works for the government, there are some startled reactions when Franklin pops up in Whitehall between acting jobs, he says. "Between the last government and this one, I went in to do an audit of the language the Treasury was using in things like the Budget and their website," the actor says. "I had my Stewart Pearson beard on - because that's my beard - and I do get very strange looks from people walking around the Treasury or HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] from people going, 'Satan lives!' "What's great about this show is that its biggest fans are people who work in government. Real MPs do want to come and have their picture taken with you, which always seems really bizarre to me." Back in Scarborough, Franklin praises Laughton's writer, the author and geologist Roger Osborne, for his use of language. "So much of what we do in life is about reading stuff and understanding what lies behind it," he says. "Does that make sense? Whether that's us buying an insurance project or playing Charles Laughton. So choosing the right words is really important." Laughton is at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough until 26 October. </body>

      <body>Living for two years in Paris changed Vincent van Gogh. He might not have realised it at the time, but as he met other artists in the French capital, he gradually moved away from his dark, sombre Dutch works - towards much brighter palettes and expressive brush work. Van Gogh's transitional story is currently being told at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London - with paintings by the artist and his contemporaries on show. Take a look with gallery partner, Nicholas Maclean. Van Gogh in Paris can be seen at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London, until 29 November 2013. Reservations required.

      <title>Lech Walesa: 'I only fear God, and my wife'</title>
      <description>What does the former Solidarity leader make of his biopic?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24538140</url>
      <date>1382082115</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70494000/jpg/_70494898_walesa_-002.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>In the space of a few months, Lech Walesa went from being an electrician in a Polish shipyard to one of the most famous faces in global politics. So how does he feel about the new film of his life? Early on in the biopic Walesa: Man of Hope, a character describes Lech Walesa as being "full of contradictions and surprises". Walesa, in the UK to promote the film at the London Film Festival, smiles when I quote the line back at him. "I am a man of surprises," he says. "That's why I won. I surprised the communists, I surprised Yeltsin, I surprised many presidents." And then, after a pause, he adds: "I had a lot of luck as well." Walesa: Man of Hope is acclaimed Polish director Andrzej Wajda's companion piece to his Man of Marble (1976) and Man of Iron (1981). The film charts Walesa's life from the bloody suppression of the 1970 workers' protests through to the founding of the Solidarity union in 1980, the imposition of Martial Law in 1981, and the eventual fall of communism. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and was elected president of Poland in 1990 (although the film stops before this point). Wajda has described Wałesa as "the most difficult subject I have ever dealt with" in his 55 years of film-making. "I just don't see any other director making a movie about Lech that I would find satisfying. I have no other choice," he said in his director's statement. Although Walesa is helping to promote the biopic, he kept his distance when it was being made. "I didn't interfere and I didn't want to get involved with the film-making," he explains. "Wajda needed to finish off and underline communism." In the film, Walesa is played by Polish theatre and film actor Robert Wieckiewicz whose on-screen likeness to the moustachioed union leader is uncanny. Wieckiewicz's Walesa comes across as both a charismatic and contradictory figure. At one point his character admits: "I am a man of great internal anger." The film picks up Walesa's life story in 1970 as the communist authorities put down the workers' protests, and Wałesa is forced to sign a paper agreeing to be an informer. The following scenes showing his path to political maturity and its impact on his family life and relationship with his wife Danuta (Agnieszka Grochowska). Wieckiewicz didn't meet Walesa as preparation for the role. Their first encounter was at this year's Venice Film Festival. The actor wasn't concerned he was portraying such a well-known figure, and one who is still alive. "For me he is just a man, a worker, a husband and father. Of course he is a leader and a very smart, intelligent man and Nobel prize winner," he says. "So I approached this role in the same way as any other role. Read the script and try and capture the different levels of the character." He remembers being a teenager in 1980 and hearing about the Gdansk shipyard strike on Radio Free Europe. He went to Gdansk on holiday and recalls the "atmosphere of freedom" in the Baltic seaport city. "You could say whatever you wanted without censorship. For the first time in my life I could breath. "Walesa was like a man from Mars, a super-hero. People understood him. He was like us. " He acknowledges the post-presidential Walesa remains a controversial figure. "He is not an easy man to manage. He doesn't want to shut his mouth. He is still active in political sense. Sometimes he says something tricky. "Polish society is divided between people who still believe he is a hero and others who think he is a traitor." He adds: "In the history of the world there are a lot of people who are icons - like [Nelson] Mandela - because they did something very important for other people in the world. Walesa is, in my opinion, among them." Walesa remains enigmatic when asked what he thinks of his portrayal on the big screen. "I have no opinion. I'm going to allow the viewers to make their minds up." How hard did he find balancing his life as a family man with being a political activist? "It was very hard because I always want to be the best. I'm not sure if it worked. I was born to be number one. "I don't have regrets I didn't spend more time with my family because I've lived my life to the full and you can't look back in regret." Walesa points out there could be "another 30 films" made about his life. "This is one viewpoint, but there are many different viewpoints. This is only two hours of my 70 years. "You could make a lot more films about what happened. Time will show whether this is a good film or not." What is not in doubt from the film is in taking on the authorities, Walesa placed himself in great danger. During the arrests and interrogations, how afraid was he? "I'm a man of faith," he replies. "I only fear God, and my wife - sometimes." Walesa: Man of Hope is out in the UK on 18 October </body>

      <title>Why academics are taking comic books seriously</title>
      <description>The academics in thrall to formerly "throwaway" literature</description>

      <body>Thousands of comic fans are descending on a small Cumbrian town this weekend for an international festival. Among them will be a growing number of academics who are now taking the art form - previously regarded by many as "throwaway" - as seriously as other literature. With Batman, Superman and The Avengers dominating box offices after making the leap from the page to the big screen, comic-inspired characters have been making a comeback for years. But it is not just cinema-goers who are drawn to the exploits of cartoon creations. Academics are also taking an increasing interest in the world of comics and graphic novels. There are now thought to be about 150 comic scholars in the UK - university lecturers, PhD students and independent researchers. They are exploring how subjects such as gender, feminism, history and mental and physical health are portrayed. Dr Mel Gibson, a comic book expert at Northumbria University, said the genre had "matured" in the 1980s, mainly thanks to British writers such as Bryan Talbot, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison. "That's also when academics got involved. But it's not ivory tower stuff, it's rooted in the real world. It has practical applications," she said. Dr Gibson is one of 50 leading figures from the world of graphic novels who will be appearing at the inaugural Lakes International Comic Art Festival in Kendal from Friday until Sunday. With writers, artists and industry figures coming from as far afield as Japan, the United States and Scandinavia, the event promises to transform the picturesque Cumbrian market town. While there are still only a handful of courses across the UK dedicated solely to comics and graphic novels, Dr Gibson says they find their way into many traditional undergraduate subjects. "Some of my final-year students are looking at children's literature and as part of that they will explore comics and graphic novels," she said. "They can even be included in social work studies and paediatric nursing - Bryan Talbot's The Tale of One Bad Rat has been used by health professionals around the world dealing with people who have suffered childhood abuse. "The victims might not want to or be able to talk about their situation, but through the story they can begin a discussion. That's a valuable tool for a health worker to have in their arsenal." The Tale of One Bad Rat, written in 1994, tells the story of a girl who flees London to escape sexual abuse at the hands of her father. "That is the graphic novel I'm most proud of," said Talbot. "I still get people today writing to me to say they were abused and that the book helped them cope." The 61-year-old - a founding patron of the Lakes event - is a doyen of the comic art world. Originally from Wigan, he has lived in Sunderland for the past 15 years with his wife Mary, an academic-turned-graphic novelist, and the pair won the Costa 2012 biography prize after teaming up for Dotter of Her Father's Eyes. It was with one of the first British graphic novels, The Adventures of Luther Arkwright, that Talbot made his name in the late 1970s. A story of parallel worlds, it features several nods to the poet William Blake. More recently, 2007's Alice in Sunderland explored the links between the North East city and author Lewis Carroll, mixing myth and history along the way. In recognition of his work, Bryan was given an honorary doctorate by Sunderland University in 2009 while last year he was presented with an honorary degree of doctor of letters by Northumbria University. "Academic interest has grown over the years and I'm proud," he said. "Someone once sent me a PhD thesis they had written about Luther Arkwright and its historical elements. "When I started working in comics it was almost like working at the bottom of the artistic barrel. To most people they were only just more interesting than patterned toilet paper. "Steadily they gained credibility, but that's down to the talent of the writers and illustrators. If the novels weren't any good then no one would be taking any notice of them." Taking inspiration from the annual Angouleme International Comics Festival in France - which draws 250,000 fans - the Lakes event will feature ticketed exhibitions, workshops and panels, as well as a programme of free family-friendly events. Venues across the town will stage sessions, shops are displaying artwork by schoolchildren and college students while the town hall will even replace its Union flag with one bearing the Batman logo. Talbot's latest work, again in partnership with his wife Mary, as well as illustrator Kate Charlesworth, is Sally Heathcote: Suffragette - a tale following a maid-of-all-work and the fight for the vote in Edwardian Britain. For academics such as Dr Gibson, gender is a key area of study. "Sally Heathcote is an example of a strong central female character - something comics are now very good at," she said. "For a while it was forgotten that girls read comics, much less that they were represented within them. "In the 1960s publications such as Jackie featured comic strips, but they disappeared over a period of 20 years and those titles began to steer girls towards magazines like Cosmopolitan rather than comics, which is different to the way boys' reading patterns were shaped." For Dr Gibson the move from a niche, underground offering to graphic novels being seen by many as having mainstream educational appeal is a welcome one. "Graphic novels were once seen as throwaway, but now they are more highly valued and viewed as things which deserve space on the bookshelf." </body>

      <title>'Silver Swans' taking up ballet</title>
      <description>The pensioners who are taking ballet lessons</description>

      <body>More and more pensioners are taking up ballet, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. It is putting the phenomenon down to the popularity of TV programmes like Strictly Come Dancing. In a locker room at Scottish Ballet, a group of dancers are lacing up their ballet shoes. Only one thing marks them out from the other dancers here. These dancers are all in their 60s and 70s. Today, they are rehearsing Swan Lake. Among them is Alicia Steele. She danced when she was young. Now, nearly 80, she's back. "I went to keep fit classes, but I found them a bit boring," she says. "And I love the music with the piano. I just love it and it makes you feel a bit young again. It doesn't make you look young, but it makes you feel young inside." There's been a 70% jump in the number of adult dancers signing up for classes in recent years, according to the Royal Academy of Dance. Some, like Alicia, danced when they were young. Others are complete beginners. Their oldest ballerina is 102. Preston Clare, teacher of the Scottish Ballet's Regenerate group, says he has been astonished by the change he has seen in his older pupils. "The amazing thing with these ladies is they've grown," he says. "They've stopped slouching now and it's just fantastic to see the difference in them. "They're opening up completely and able to feel more confident in themselves." The lessons at Scottish Ballet have proved so popular, they have added extra classes, and they still have a waiting list. Ballet is good for muscles, balance and memory, but 68-year-old Alison Templeton says it is not just the physical challenge she comes for. "A number of the ladies have lost husbands this year, including myself, and the support of the other ladies is just remarkable," she says. "It does help, and it gives you a focus to go out in the week and do something." Marlene Gillespie, 71, says she absolutely loves the experience. "I can't wait to come," she says. "I love the music. I love the exercise. "We have good days, bad days, we've all been through different things. And I just think it's a wonderful way to exercise, especially for elderly people." Renee Gillespie, 75, adds: "You know you can't really do what you're asked to do but you have great fun trying. And so it's good exercise, it's great fun and it's wonderfully sociable." While some senior citizens are taking on the classics, Dr Anne Hogan, from the Royal Academy of Dance, says for others there is the more gentle option of armchair ballet. "Dance is something that can be modified to all ages and all levels of experience," she says. "In the programme recently, when we trained people to work with older learners, they went into situations in some of the care homes where you had people who had to be seated the entire class, but had a great dance class. "There's lots of movement that can be adapted to people's needs." Following the Genee, the world's biggest dance competition, held in Glasgow last month, the Royal Academy of Dance is holding a week of free ballet lessons across Scotland in January. They hope it will get even more people spend their twilight years at the barre. </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>RBS decision imminent, says Osborne</title>
      <description>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he tells the Daily Telegraph.</description>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <title>Salmond: 'Scotland's time is now'</title>
      <description>SNP leader Alex Salmond tells his party conference it is "time for independence" and that the case for voting yes will be made on 26 November.</description>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <body>The Aberdeen North Labour MP Frank Doran is to stand down at the next general election in 2015. He has represented the people of the north east city at Westminster since 1987. Mr Doran told the party he believed it was now time to step aside and give someone else the chance to fight for the seat. The 64-year-old said it had been an "enormous privilege to represent the city in parliament". Mr Doran was elected MP for Aberdeen South in 1987 and subsequently for Aberdeen Central in 1997. Following boundary changes in 2005, he was then elected to represent Aberdeen North. The MP said: "By the next election I will have been an MP for 23 years I think it is time to step aside to give someone else the chance from the Labour Party the opportunity to represent Aberdeen in Westminster." Mr Doran was shadow minister for energy between 1988 and 1992, he has sat on the culture, media and sport select committee and has campaigned for improved safety in the North Sea. </body>

      <title>Drop siege mentality, says Robinson</title>
      <description>First Minister Peter Robinson has challenged unionists to drop their "siege mentality" during a speech to Castlereagh council.</description>

      <body>First Minister Peter Robinson has challenged unionists to drop their "siege mentality". He said they should move forward with nationalists to overcome the problems facing Northern Ireland. "Unionism has historically had a siege mentality," he said. "When we were being besieged it was the right response. But when we are in a constitutionally safe and stable position it poses a threat to our future development." Mr Robinson made his remarks in a speech to Castlereagh council on Friday. It came less than 24 hours after he acknowledged the efforts of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) to build better community relations in a symbolic address at Queen's University in Belfast. "Unionists and nationalists will face some big decisions in the next few months," added Mr Robinson. "We can get back on track to a shared and united community which can benefit everyone in Northern Ireland or we can go back to the 40-year conflict. There is no middle option." Reflecting on a troubled last 12 months, when disputes over flags, parades and commemorations erupted into street disorder and damaged community relations, the DUP leader said there was a need for more strategic thinking within unionism. He urged the unionist community not to let recent difficulties throw them off course from the ultimate objective of forging a "shared and united" society. Mr Robinson said there was no prospect of the assembly falling, but nevertheless warned that such a development would likely lead to an upsurge in paramilitary violence. Former US diplomat Dr Richard Haass is currently chairing talks in a bid to find solutions on the contentious issues of flags, parades and dealing with the past. While Mr Robinson's address included criticism of, and challenges to, nationalism and republicanism, its intended audience was unionism. He said the Union was stronger than ever, and cautioned unionists not to "turn the clock back to a bygone era" and urged them to have more self confidence. He said unionism should not be defined simply by the issues of "flags and parades" but by what he described as the benefits of living in the UK. "Unionism needs to think and act strategically," he said. "Adopting political strategies that will inevitably lead down a cul de sac is not politically courageous, it is politically crazy. Because if unionists are not seen to make Northern Ireland work within the Union then no one will. "Unionism will only succeed if it is a broad coalition of interests. I accept that not every person who wishes to remain part of the United Kingdom will share my affection for the national flag or even my cultural heritage. "My responsibility as leader of the largest unionist party is to seek to hold that broad coalition together for it is only the capacity to bring together those with differing views under a common banner that gives unionism its strength." The speech marked the installation of David Drysdale as mayor of Castlereagh. </body>

      <title>PM backs 'illegal immigrant' texts</title>
      <description>David Cameron backs the 'principle' of sending warning text messages to suspected illegal immigrants - even though some have gone to the wrong people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron "agrees with the principle" of sending text messages suggesting the recipients are illegal immigrants, despite some going to the wrong people, his spokesman has said. The Home Office says just 14 people out of a total of 58,800 contacted were mistakenly asked if they had overstayed their visas. But campaigners say the true number of people wrongly contacted is far higher. Labour described the government's tactic as "shambolic and incompetent". Some people suspected of having outstayed their visas were sent a text reading: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The prime minister's official spokesman acknowledged that the wording of the texts had changed since the campaign began. Originally, they had included the phrase: "You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain." The Home Office said it was "right to enforce the rules", and Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "The prime minister agrees with the principle of the texts. "It is one of various means the Home Office contacts people who may not have the right to remain in the UK." But two recipients of the texts - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the message. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted in this way. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear". But the Home Office defended its position: "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." The individuals affected had been contacted in a variety of ways, including email and text, it added. It also denied that Mr Grover had been contacted at all. Mr Grover told the BBC he would instruct his lawyers to write to the Home Office, challenging its claim he had not received the text directly. The department has received more than 140 complaints about the campaign, although Capita said: "Most complaints occurred in the early part of the contract where Capita was, as part of the contract, updating sometimes out-of-date Home Office records." Capita believes that 4,160 people have departed the UK since December 2012 as a result as a result of being contacted, the Home Office said. Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: "Theresa May's immigration system lurches from one gimmick to another with little effect. "The reports that the government has allowed a private contractor to send British citizens text message telling them to leave the country demonstrates once more just how shambolic and incompetent the Home Office's border police is under Theresa May. "These messages will rightly cause distress and offence to British citizens, many of whom have done much to contribute to our society. It is simply wrong for this sort of message to be sent by text, and to be so poorly targeted." UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who campaigns for tighter border controls and Britain's exit from the EU, said the text message scheme was the product of a government with "absolutely zero sensibility and even less sense". "To send threatening text messages and emails to people on some sort of clearly ill-managed central database is deeply disturbing and the sort of behaviour one would expect from a fascistic police state, not a democratic and inclusive nation. Quite frankly it's abhorrent." UKIP MEP candidate Amjad Bashir said: "I find it utterly repugnant that people like me, who may have been born abroad but who are passport-holding and hard-working citizens of the UK are being threatened by the government in this way." Meanwhile, immigration minister Mark Harper has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be deployed across the UK. He told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper told Question Time: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." </body>

      <body>Michael Portillo has said he "misspoke" when he claimed he had heard former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell say the word "pleb". Mr Mitchell resigned his post in 2012 after Downing Street police accused him of calling them plebs during a row - a word he denied having used. In a live discussion on the BBC's This Week, Mr Portillo revealed: "I have heard him use that word in private conversation - the pleb word, I mean." But he now says he got "carried away". Pressed on the This Week programme on Thursday about whether he had heard Mr Mitchell use the word, Mr Portillo said: "I think I did, but not in a bad context. "Some policeman thought: 'Ah, that's a word that people will believe that Andrew Mitchell might have used.' "But he wouldn't have used it in that context." On Friday, the former Conservative cabinet minister added: "I seem to have misspoken. I had no right to say that. "I think I got carried away in the heat of the moment. I did not mean to say it and I want to withdraw it." The former politician, who served as defence secretary under John Major, is a regular pundit on the show. Mr Mitchell admitted swearing during the September 2012 row with police officers who said he could not ride his bicycle through the main Downing Street gate. But he also maintained: "I think most people who know me know I would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone." The Conservative MP has claimed that the officers involved conspired against him in a bid to "toxify" his party. After a meeting with Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012, three local representatives of the Police Federation criticised the MP for casting doubt on the Downing Street officers' version of events, said he had refused to disclose the exact words he had used in the row, and had "no option but to resign". Mr Mitchell says he has a transcript contradicting their account of the meeting. The chiefs of West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire police forces concluded that no disciplinary action was needed against their officers, even though an internal investigation by West Mercia Police had initially said there was a "case to answer for misconduct". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said the officers who spoke to Mr Mitchell should have faced misconduct hearings, and Prime Minister David Cameron has said the MP is "owed an apology". Eight people have been arrested and bailed under Scotland Yard's investigation into the affair, including five police officers. The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to bring criminal charges against any of them. </body>

      <title>SNP pledges energy bill cut post Yes</title>
      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans to cut energy bills by 5% a year in an independent Scotland.</description>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister has unveiled plans to cut energy bills by about 5% a year if the country votes for independence. Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP's conference in Perth the reduction of about £70 would be achieved by removing a number of "green" charges. She believed the measure would not be a short-term fix, but a "real and lasting cut". People in Scotland vote in an independence referendum next year. On Thursday, 18 September, 2014, they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Ms Sturgeon explained that two schemes worth up to half of the green costs imposed on energy companies would be removed from the bills of consumers. The minister told the party's annual gathering: "Right now, the Scottish government invests around £80m a year on energy efficiency schemes to help meet our climate change targets and lower the costs of energy bills. "A further £120m comes from a scheme designed in Westminster, operated through energy companies and paid for by a levy on your gas and electricity bills. "It is a disjointed approach, it doesn't take account of Scottish priorities and it's not as efficient as it could be." Ms Sturgeon went on to announce that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would remove the energy saving measures and the warm home discount from energy bills. She said the current system would be replaced by a more joined-up approach with funding for fuel poverty schemes - worth up to £200m per year - coming directly from government. Ms Sturgeon added: "Independence will allow us to tackle fuel poverty much more directly, delivering Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and ensuring that energy companies always behave in a socially responsible way to protect vulnerable customers." She insisted the energy schemes would be delivered more effectively and it would save hard-pressed consumers money. The SNP deputy leader told the conference: "We estimate that it will cut energy bills by around 5% - or £70 a year. "Not a short-term measure - but a real and lasting cut in Scottish energy bills." The minister went on to demand that the coalition government at Westminster ditch its spare room subsidy, which is described by critics as the ''bedroom tax''. But she said if it refused to act, the current Scottish government would allocate "up to £20m" for a second year to help those who have been affected. Ms Sturgeon also announced that the Holyrood administration would fund the Poverty Alliance to deliver a Living Wage Accreditation Scheme to "promote the living wage and increase the number of private companies that pay it". Turning to the issue of health, Ms Sturgeon said a UK-wide approach "would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the Scottish NHS". She added: "Westminster privatisation of the NHS is not wanted in Scotland. "Scotland's national health service is staying in public hands." Ms Sturgeon went on to warn that Westminster MPs in all the UK parties were "itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending". She said: "So, I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind [on independence]. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote. "They are clear and they are real. Scotland's social security system will be dismantled; Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat and Scotland's budget will be cut. "The risks of a No vote are real." Ms Sturgeon promised that the Scottish government's White Paper on independence, which is due to be published next month, would "answer all your questions". She added: "The White Paper will be Scotland's detailed guide to independence. "It will make the positive case. It will explain the process by which we will become independent and describe how our newly independent country will work. "It will set out the gains of independence for you, your family and for your community." Towards the end of her speech, Ms Sturgeon said: "The vote in 2014 is not a vote for or against the SNP. "It is a vote for or against the power to take decisions in Scotland." She insisted that an SNP government after independence would bring the mail service back into public ownership; reverse welfare reforms; protect state pensions and get rid of Trident nuclear weapons. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail 'sales pitch leaked'</title>
      <description>The RMT says it has obtained leaked documents that show the government is playing down the success of a publicly-owned rail line in its pitch to would-be investors.</description>

      <body>A rail union claims to have obtained a leaked copy of a prospectus for the privatisation of the East Coast Main Line. The RMT says the document shows the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership to "bulldoze" the sale of it through. The East Coast line was taken back into public hands in 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise. The government said the RMT was "scaremongering". But the RMT says the leaked prospectus showed the government was engaged in a "systematic and politically motivated devaluation of the performance" of the line, which is due to return to private hands in 2015. The document appears to be a draft version of the final sale brochure for potential investors, with handwritten notes and revisions in the margin. It is intended for "investment professionals only" and not for wider circulation, the text warns. The union claims a paragraph noting the line "three percentage points ahead of the long-distance train operator average" in the 2012 National Passenger Survey had been deleted. A comment on the document also referred to avoiding "references to competitors", the union claimed. "The crucial commentary that East Coast is not only ahead of Virgin and First Great Western - the other inter-city franchise holders - but that East Coast under public ownership is also amongst the highest performers in Europe for passengers per mile had been redacted," the union added. RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: "This leaked document, coming on the day of union protests at Parliament aimed at keeping the East Coast in public ownership, is political dynamite which blows the lid off the lengths to which the government are prepared to go to bulldoze through reprivatisation before the next election. "The fact that the public option is putting over £1bn back into the Treasury, while improving services and delivering more capacity, has been cynically airbrushed out of the final document in a disgraceful piece of political chicanery which must be called in for scrutiny to hold back this full-tilt dash for privatisation." The union also said the document redacts sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. But a Department for Transport spokesman said: "This is ill informed scaremongering from the RMT. "By choosing to release inaccurate information, they are misleading the public. We have no intention of requiring a 'third class' service, reducing performance levels, or in any way devaluing this vital railway. "As the independent Brown Review concluded, franchising works for passengers and taxpayers alike. " Labour says services can be run just as well under public ownership. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: "East Coast is working well and will have returned £800m to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year. "This government has learned nothing from the West Coast franchising fiasco, which saw over £50m of taxpayers' money wasted in compensation to train companies, through ministers' incompetence." </body>

      <title>Cable defends Royal Mail sale price</title>
      <description>Business Secretary Vince Cable defends the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5.</description>

      <body>Business Secretary Vince Cable has defended the 330p flotation price of Royal Mail on a day when shares in the company briefly touched £5. Value for money was important, but it was "about more than just the level of proceeds received on day one" of the flotation, he said in a letter to MPs. Some big investors declined to invest in Royal Mail, while others were uneasy about possible strike action, he added. The remarks were made to the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. In the letter, Mr Cable says the price was set to ensure a successful transaction, good value, the ability to sell off the remaining government stake in the business and it being able to access finance from the markets. The price range was determined using market testing which involved consulting with a core group of 20 investment institutions. It was also priced relative to comparable companies operating elsewhere in Europe. He said that the threat of industrial action by the postal workers' union was also a factor that influenced the initial price range. "There were some investors who stated that they were not willing to invest at all and many others who focused on the business and financial implications of strike action," Mr Cable said. The letter says it was the banks employed to coordinate the sale - Goldman Sachs and UBS - that recommended the 260p to 330p price range for the shares. This was also endorsed by the government's independent adviser, the investment bank Lazard. The consultation process with investors, known as "pilot fishing", revealed that there would be sufficient demand for shares at the bottom of the range, even with the threat of industrial action. A slightly lower upper end for the price range was initially recommended. That was subsequently revised upwards "following ongoing positive feedback", he said. The final 330p float price was agreed based on final demand indications. It was endorsed by Lazard. The investment bank has now been asked to appear before the BIS Select committee amid concerns that Royal Mail was sold off too cheaply. When it became clear the share offer was many times oversubscribed (20 times for the institutional offer, seven times for the retail offer) the government did consider revising the price upwards. But this was not done "based on an assessment of the composition of demand... and an assessment of where demand would taper off," Mr Cable writes. There was also a view that this would introduce an "execution risk" to the sell off. Mr Cable said the banks helping with the sell off "recommended against increasing the price range; this advice was endorsed by Lazard". The letter does not address why the current price of Royal Mail has gone so high. But its understood the government believes this is down to the scarcity of shares available. It also believes hedge funds - some from the US - may be buying at this elevated price in the belief that Royal Mail may be transformed and modernised quicker than anticipated. </body>

      <title>Lib Dems 'veer left like a trolley'</title>
      <description>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, recently sacked as a Home Office minister, compares his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left".</description>

      <body>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, who was sacked as a Home Office minister in a recent reshuffle, has compared his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left". In an interview with the Times, he said he had spent years trying to exert "corrective pressure" on the Lib Dems to make them a "party of government". Now they were in danger of becoming a "party of protest" again, he warned. "We must avoid facing inwards," he told the newspaper. Mr Browne had been regarded as one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's closest allies before the reshuffle and a rising star within the party. He was replaced at the Home Office by fellow Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, seen as being on the left of the party. Mr Browne described his sacking as "puzzling" and "a bit painful". "I saw my role, and continue to do so, as doing everything I can to accelerate the Lib Dems' journey from a party of protest to a party of government," he said. The MP for Taunton Deane, in Somerset, continued: "If the Lib Dems look ambivalent about being in government we can hardly then complain if people assume that its successes must be down to the party that doesn't look ambivalent. "You can't be half in and half out of government. We have to avoid the trap of looking like a party that is a reluctant party of government and looking uncomfortable and that we'd be grateful to be relieved of our collective responsibilities. "There is a role in politics for stopping things you don't want to happen, but I want the greatest emphasis to be on what we have managed to achieve rather than what we have managed to prevent the Conservatives from achieving." Mr Browne was appointed a Foreign Office minister when the Lib Dem/Tory coalition government was formed in 2010 and was moved to the Home Office in 2012. At the Lib Dem conference in September, he accused the Liberal Democrats of being "uncomfortable" with wealth creation and always wanting "to demonstrate our disapproval of people becoming wealthy and successful and creating jobs in our economy". He also called for a debate on whether Muslim girls should be banned from wearing full-face veils in some public places. He ruled out defecting to the Conservative Party in his Times interview, saying he had turned down the offer of a meeting with Tory chairman Grant Shapps. He told the newspaper he planned to fight the next election as a Liberal Democrat. "I had no intention or desire to defect to the Conservatives," he added. </body>

      <body>Sun journalist Nick Parker and a second man will be charged by police over the theft of an MP's mobile phone in 2010. Mr Parker, 52, from south-west London, is accused of one count of receiving stolen goods and one of unauthorised access to computer material. Michael Ankers, 29, from south-west London, faces one count of theft of a phone belonging to Labour MP Siobhain McDonagh. Both men will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 6 November. Gregor McGill, a lawyer at the Crown Prosecution Service, said there was insufficient evidence to charge another suspect in relation to the case. Ms McDonagh, who has represented Mitcham and Morden since 1997, had her mobile phone stolen from her car in Colliers Wood in south-west London on 17 October 2010. The accusations against Parker and Ankers bring to three the number of people charged under Operation Tuleta, a Scotland Yard investigation focused on computer hacking and other alleged privacy breaches. Operation Tuleta began in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal. It is being run by the Metropolitan Police alongside Operation Elveden, which is an investigation into inappropriate payments to public officials, and Operation Weeting, the Met's phone-hacking inquiry. Mr Parker has already been charged with three counts of conspiracy to commit misconduct in public office over payments to officials. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has also made three arrests under inquiries linked to the investigations. </body>

      <title>Offer seat to pregnant women - Cable</title>
      <description>Vince Cable enters the debate about whether pregnant MP Jo Swinson should have been offered a seat by colleagues.</description>

      <body>Vince Cable has waded into the debate about whether a heavily pregnant MP should have been offered a seat by colleagues in the Commons. Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, stood next to other MPs for half an hour at Prime Minster's Questions on Wednesday. The Lib Dem equalities minister has said she wanted to stand. But that has not stopped Mr Cable and others calling for a return to more chivalrous behaviour. The business secretary said: "I didn't see the incident. "But I think as a matter of basic consideration and good manners people should offer their seat to someone who's visibly pregnant. I'd have thought that was just automatic. "The old tradition of men offering seats to women has long gone but I think if somebody is heavily pregnant or is disabled, basic decency suggests you should give them preference." Ms Swinson, a junior minister at Mr Cable's business department, has declined interview requests about the matter, which was sparked by Twitter comments on Wednesday, after she had been spotted standing in the Commons chamber. Writing on Twitter on Thursday, she joked: "About to get on the Tube - seat offers welcome and definitely not sexist :o) But I was happier standing at pmqs yesterday." Ms Swinson, who represents East Dunbartonshire, is married to fellow Lib Dem MP Duncan Hames. The Spectator magazine's political editor James Forsyth caused a flurry of comments when he tweeted about Ms Swinson on Wednesday. "Quite remarkable that no MP has offered Jo Swinson, who is seven months pregnant, a seat. Really shocking lack of manners and decency," said Mr Forsyth. According to the Daily Mail, a source close to Ms Swinson said the suggestion that she had been unable to "fend for herself" was "quite sexist". But David Cameron appeared to disagree with this view. Asked if the prime minister would offer a pregnant woman a seat if he were to find himself on a bus, his official spokesman said: "I'm sure he would. "If we take the example of public transport, if you see someone who is in greater need of a seat than yourself, then offering that seat is the right thing to do," he said. Ms Swinson's child, her first, is due on Christmas Day, according to reports. The MP did manage to find a seat on the government front bench later on Wednesday, when most MPs had left the chamber. </body>

      <title>Life sentence for human trafficking</title>
      <description>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced.</description>

      <body>A maximum life sentence for the worst cases of human trafficking and exploitation is to be introduced. It comes after Home Secretary Theresa May said tougher sanctions would be brought in to tackle modern-day slavery earlier this year. The number of cases discovered in the UK has risen by 25% in the last year, according to government figures. Trafficking from Albania, Poland and Lithuania has seen a big rise. Ministers are planning new legislation to simplify the law on slavery, and make it easier to bring prosecutions. Victims are often targeted for sexual exploitation, construction work or begging gangs. A new report by the inter-departmental ministerial group on human trafficking has revealed that 1,186 victims were referred to the authorities in 2012, compared with 946 victims in 2011. The report revealed the largest number of victims were from Nigeria, Vietnam, Albania, Romania and China. There has been a 300% increase in Albanian trafficking, a 171% increase in victims from Lithuania, and 148% more from Poland since 2011, the report indicated. But trafficking from Romania and China had fallen, according to the figures. Victims brought to the UK are forced to do anything from work as house slaves to labour in cannabis farms. Eastern European women are most likely to be used as prostitutes, according to the report. Men are most likely to be used for construction work. There is also a trend towards forced begging, and benefit fraud - gangmasters take all the proceeds, returning very little to victims. Those targeted are often lured to the UK with the promise of free travel, a job and accommodation, sometimes by family members. An alternative is so-called 'debt bonds' where money owed must be repaid by working in the UK. Klara Skrivankova, from the Anti-Slavery International group, wants greater protection for victims - including the right to stay in the UK. "Tougher penalties and longer sentences alone do not suffice," she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "Unless the protection of victims is put on a statutory footing, we're unlikely to see more prosecutions." Victims minister Damian Green said the trafficking of vulnerable men and women was something "no civilised country should tolerate". "On Anti-Slavery Day I am proud that this government is standing strong against those who profit from human misery and last year gave £3m to support those who have suffered at their hands." Chief constable Shaun Sawyer of the Association of Chief Police Officers said "the national approach is very much about the protection of the victim", but he added: "I agree that the signposting and signalling could be clearer". "A lot of people are prosecuted for GBH, rape, violence against the individual - it's far easier to bring the perpetrator to justice this way. This Bill will make it easier to prosecute for trafficking." David Hanson MP, Labour's shadow immigration minister, said that the government needed to focus on prosecutions, pointing to the last government report which identified 946 potential victims of human trafficking, but "only eight convictions". "The government also needs to wake up to the fact that 60% of trafficked children simply go missing again in the UK after they've come to the attention of the authorities," he added. "It should be a source of shame." In her Tory party conference speech, Mrs May said an order banning someone convicted of trafficking from being a gangmaster after their release from prison would form a key part of the new bill. </body>

      <title>Hunt highlights plight of the lonely</title>

      <body>It is a source of "national shame" that as many as 800,000 people in England are "chronically lonely", Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said. In a speech, Mr Hunt highlighted the "problem of loneliness that in our busy lives we have utterly failed to confront as a society". "Some five million people say television is their main form of company," he said. Labour accused of him trying to blame families for government failures. In a speech at the National Children and Adults Services (NCAS) conference, Mr Hunt said: "Each and every lonely person has someone who could visit them and offer companionship. "A forgotten million who live amongst us - ignored to our national shame." He added: "According to the Campaign to End Loneliness, there are 800,000 people in England who are chronically lonely." He also told delegates that the 112,000 cases of alleged abuse in care homes referred by English councils in 2012-13, the majority involving over-65s, indicated that "something is badly wrong". But the regulation of care in both the private and public sector was improving, he argued. The Conservative MP said the new chief inspector of social care, Andrea Sutcliffe, would start to give ratings to care homes from April 2014 with a view to organising inspections of all 25,000 care homes by 2016. Mr Hunt said he was "particularly worried" about the 400,000 people in care homes, some of whom get regular visits but others who were just "parked there". He said that 46% of people aged 80 or over reported feeling lonely "some of the time or often". He warned that loneliness was as "bad for you" as "smoking 15 cigarettes a day", was "worse than obesity" because of the risk of blood clots, heart disease and dementia, and warned that lonely people "drink more" and were more prone to early admission in residential or nursing care. Mr Hunt also said he believed the UK should learn from Asian cultures where there was "reverence and respect for older people" and "residential care is a last rather than a first option". "The social contract is stronger because as children see how their own grandparents are looked after, they develop higher expectations of how they too will be treated when they get old," he explained. "If we are to tackle the challenge of an ageing society, we must learn from this - and restore and reinvigorate the social contract between generations. "And uncomfortable though it is to say it, it will only start with changes in the way we personally treat our own parents and grandparents." England should aim to become "the best place in the world to grow old in", he concluded. But Labour said the "real national shame" was "Jeremy Hunt's attempt to shift the blame for dealing with the very real problems of loneliness amongst elderly people on to families alone". Shadow health and social care minister Liz Kendall said: "He seems completely unaware that there are over six million unpaid family carers in Britain today, one in five of whom provide more than 50 hours care a week for their loved ones. "These unsung heroes save the taxpayer billions of pounds yet often get precious little support in return. "Families, friends and neighbours need a decent care system to back up their efforts to look after elderly people, but the reality is our care system is in crisis and has been pushed to the brink of collapse. "Jeremy Hunt and David Cameron need to take responsibly for their government's actions rather than trying to turn the clock back and say it's down to families alone." Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said on Twitter that Jeremy Hunt was "right to highlight isolation of older people". He added: "But he can't get away from fact that Govt cuts to care have made it much worse." But speaking on the BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Anthea Tinker, professor of social gerontology at King's College in London, said it was a "myth" that eastern Asian families placed greater reverence on families and older people than in the West. "The reality is that with one-child-families, children have often moved to a city or emigrated," she said. "So it's just not practical for families to depend on their children. One of the largest nursing homes in the world is about to open in China, for 5,000 people, which is amazing." Prof Tinker added: "We've got to look at the reality rather than the myth." Mr Hunt's speech came as a BBC poll found that almost half of all adults said they experienced feelings of loneliness. The survey of more than 2,500 adults in England was commissioned for BBC Radio 2 and BBC Local Radio's Faith In The World Week. It also showed that people who practised a religion felt lonelier than those who did not. London was identified the loneliest place with a figure of 52% compared with 45% in the south west of England. </body>

      <body>Probation officers in England and Wales have voted to strike over government privatisation plans. Private firms and charities are currently bidding for contracts worth £450m to supervise 225,000 low and medium-risk offenders each year. The probation officers' union, Napo, said there had been a 46% turn-out, with more than 80% voting yes for action. No date has been given. It warned selling off the Probation Service would boost re-offending rates. The government called the vote "disappointing" and said it would continue to engage with unions. Under the proposals, most of the Probation Service's work will be done under new payment-by-results contracts, to be awarded in 20 English regions. The whole of Wales will be one region. The contracts would mean that low and medium-risk offenders will be supervised by a mix of private firms, charities and voluntary groups. More than 700 organisations from around the world, as well as hundreds of British firms, have expressed interest in the contracts, the Ministry of Justice has said. A new public sector body, the National Probation Service, will be created to deal with the rehabilitation of 31,000 high-risk offenders each year. Napo general secretary Ian Lawrence said his organisation would pursue the mandate for industrial action "with vigour" but would also seek "to avoid this if possible by way of further negotiations with ministers". He said "decimating the award-winning public sector Probation Service and selling it off to the likes of G4S and Serco will result in increased re-offending rates, a lack of continuity in risk management, and will see the privateers making huge profits at the expense of victims, offenders and taxpayers." Justice Minister Jeremy Wright said news of the strike was "disappointing" but stressed there were "well-established contingency arrangements". "More than 600,000 offences were committed last year by those who had broken the law before, despite spending £4bn a year on prisons and probation," he said. "The public deserves better and we are committed to introducing our important reforms, which were widely consulted on. "We will continue to support staff and engage with unions as our reforms move forwards." Max Chambers, head of crime and justice at the right-leaning think-tank Policy Exchange, said industrial action was not the way forward and called for the Probation Service to "get on board" with the changes. "It's no surprise that some probation staff are worried about the future, but striking is not a very clever move and could put the public at risk," he said. "There are huge opportunities that payment-by-results can offer staff, including greater professional discretion, more freedom to innovate and the chance to have a stake in their own mutual organisations." A government-wide review of all contracts held by G4S and Serco is being conducted after it emerged the firms had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" for electronic tags for criminals. Serco has said it is "co-operating fully". G4S has said it "co-operated fully" with a previous audit started earlier this year and was conducting its own inquiry but was not aware of any indications of dishonesty or misconduct. The two firms will not be awarded any contracts until the government audit is completed, but Justice Secretary Chris Grayling has allowed them to bid for the probation service. </body>

      <title>Shared society way forward: Robinson</title>
      <description>First Minister Peter Robinson says that a shared and united society is the only way forward for Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>First Minister Peter Robinson has said that a shared and united society is the only way forward for Northern Ireland. He added that politicians need to reach out beyond what they see as their "own community". "Our challenge must be to make what is often merely a sound-bite into a meaningful reality," said the DUP leader. He was speaking at a Co-Operation Ireland dinner at Queen's University in Belfast on Thursday night. The dinner had been organised to acknowledge the efforts of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) to forge better community relations. Mr Robinson said that while it is easier and more comfortable for politicians and people in wider society to retreat to safe and familiar ground, that is not the ground where progress will be made. "I am entirely convinced that a shared and united society in Northern Ireland is the only way forward for all of us," said Mr Robinson. "I would not be here tonight, or be involved in politics at all, if I were not personally committed to making progress in Northern Ireland. "Anyone who believes that there is a better alternative to the political process we are engaged in simply doesn't understand reality. "Finding solutions is easier said than done. Progress can be slow - frustratingly slow. And when two steps forward are followed by one step back it is easy to become disillusioned and forget how far we have come. "I am absolutely convinced that 'respect' is the key to progress. And that 'understanding' is the key to 'respect'. "Understanding requires us all to listen as well as talk. There is a difference between listening and merely hearing. Sometimes I feel that unionists say one thing, but nationalists hear something else. I'm certain the reverse is also the case. We must learn to communicate better." Mr Robinson also paid tribute to the GAA. "In the last few years Co-Operation Ireland has celebrated the role of rugby and football in peace-building and it is fitting that tonight we very publicly acknowledge the important role of the GAA. "It is a testament to the progress that we have all made that tonight we can acknowledge the GAA's role in peace-building by inviting a first minister from the unionist tradition to the lectern. "Not so many years ago it would have been unimaginable that I would have been invited to speak at an event of this kind - or that I would have accepted. "Thankfully the world has moved on. We are all on a journey. Although I think we each recognise that there is still some distance to travel. "For my part I want to see my party reaching out further in the years to come and I am certain that the GAA leadership will want to do the same." Danny Murphy, secretary of the GAA's Ulster Council, said the presence of the DUP leader was a "significant step" on the way to improving community relations. He said: "While it is not an intrinsic GAA event, it is a GAA event organised by Co-operation Ireland. I think in those terms it is another significant step along the road of improving relationships right across the whole sector." </body>

      <title>'Buffer zones' for shale projects</title>
      <description>Planning rules governing the extraction of onshore shale gas and oil in Scotland will be made more robust, the Scottish government announces.</description>

      <body>Planning rules governing the extraction of shale gas and onshore oil in Scotland will be made tougher, the Scottish government has said. It believes there should be reinforced protection for communities near sites of new energy sources, including the controversial fracking method. Climate Change Minister Paul Wheelhouse also said he wanted to see buffer zones between sites and settlements. The new planning policy will come into force next year. Environmental campaigners have welcomed the changes, describing them as a "setback" for firms hoping to extract shale gas. Mr Wheelhouse made the announcement at the SNP conference in Perth. He said: "Any proposals for the extraction of unconventional oil and gas extraction are considered through the planning process and the appropriate regulatory regimes. "In considering such proposals it is important that the views of the local communities, and the impact on the environment are given due consideration in the planning process. "Today's announcement of a strengthening of the planning rules in relation to unconventional oil and gas, through provision of buffer zones, highlights that this government listens to local communities and the those calling for stronger environmental protection." He added that there were no "environmental permissions" at the current time which would allow hydraulic fracturing in Scotland. WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said: "This is without doubt a setback for those hoping to exploit shale gas in Scotland. "We welcome this commitment and hope it is just the first of several steps ministers will take to begin to close the door on all new fossil fuels developments in Scotland. "In the interests of tackling climate change and delivering climate justice we urgently need to be leaving fossil fuels, including shale gas, in the ground." </body>

      <title>Bid for loans to help deprived areas</title>
      <description>Ministers hold talks with the European Investment Bank to see if loans can help unlock £2.1bn of EU aid for some of Wales' most deprived communities.</description>

      <body>Ministers have held talks with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to see if loans can be secured to boost some of Wales' most deprived communities. West Wales and the valleys qualifies for £2.1bn of new EU aid that must be matched by public or private cash. Projects in the region qualify for the money due to its poor economic performance. Ministers have said Wales must not "sit back and wait" before using the money, despite public spending cuts. But a leading academic has warned Wales risks being "left behind" as other traditionally poorer areas of Europe see far higher growth levels. Finance Minister Jane Hutt told BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme the EIB was "looking at ways they can help us, until we get our borrowing powers, in perhaps different ways to fund projects". "This is not a time to sit back and wait - we have to get on with the job, and the European Investment Bank is very keen to work with us on this," she said. The west Wales and the valleys area comprises Anglesey, Conwy, Denbighshire, Gwynedd, Ceredigion, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot, Bridgend, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent, Caerphilly and Torfaen. One scheme that could receive EIB loans is the South Wales Metro, an ambitious blueprint to link train and bus service across Cardiff and the valleys. Mrs Hutt has already announced £62m will come from the Welsh government for the project. The EU money is available from 2014-2020. West Wales and the valleys received around £1.9bn in 2007-13, and a similar figure in the previous seven years. Mrs Hutt denied the money had failed to have an impact. She said: "This is about transport links, it's about regeneration, it's about helping businesses with research and development. "You can give all the numbers but these young people who have had training, does it lead to jobs? That's the important test really of how we've used our (EU) funding and it has led to these young people getting jobs." But statistics collected by the EU suggested other areas had seen higher levels of economic growth after receiving similar funding to west Wales and the valleys. Dr Adrian Healy, from Cardiff University's School of Planning and Geography, told the programme: "Previous places which have had low GDP growth, low employment, productivity value similar to Wales - and west Wales and the valleys in particular - are seeing higher levels of growth and higher rates of growth over the last five, seven, 10 years and that puts west Wales and the valleys in a particularly difficult situation. "We have a low level of activity, and it's not getting much better in comparison to those other areas that might have been seen as being similar. There is a risk of being left behind, in that sense." The Conservative Aberconwy MP Guto Bebb said the money invested so far had not transformed the Welsh economy as hoped. "If you travel the length and breadth of Wales you will find examples of waste within European structural funds which should really make us feel very ashamed," he said. "You will find arts centres which have closed, cultural centres which have closed - all this investment in buildings which look very impressive but no funding in place to keep them running. "And rather than create an entrepreneurial spirit, European funding has actually contributed to the dependency culture we have as a country."

      <title>Loan companies 'preying on the poor'</title>
      <description>A new study calls for action after finding payday and doorstep lenders were "preying on the poor".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24583073</url>

      <body>Eleanor Eamens started off borrowing £100 from a doorstep lender to help with the cost of Christmas. Soon she ended up with six separate loans, owing the lender £4,000. The mum from Belford in Northumberland found the £50-a-week payments impossible on her income, forcing her to choose between servicing the debt and feeding her five children. But even towards the end when she was missing payments, the company continued to offer her loans. She said: "I take responsibility for what I did. Nobody forced me to borrow the money, but when you are on a small income it's so tempting. "They did not ever look if I had other debts or whether I could afford it on my income. They simply didn't have a clue." And a new study carried out in the North East has found that Eleanor Eamens' experience was all too common of low income households. Durham University worked with 24 families in Middlesbrough and Stockton. Many didn't have a bank account, and the ones that did were only allowed basic services with no access to an overdraft or credit card. The most any of the families had in savings was £4, yet their debts ranged from £340 to £10,000. Many had multiple loans with payday and doorstep lenders, at annual interest rates of up to 4,000% even though their incomes were small. Professor Sarah Banks, who led the study, says this had a profound and negative impact on their lives. She said: "It was quick and convenient to get the loans, but very soon people were finding themselves saddled with large debts. "Many were desperate, some had moved home, others had gone off incognito to try and get away from the debt and many had mental health problems which were quite severe." The researchers believe these families were preyed upon by lenders even though they clearly couldn't afford the debt. Professor Banks believes there needs to be a cap on the amount loaned to individuals and greater checks on their ability to pay. She said: "The companies were purely interested in getting more customers and not in whether people could pay it back. They charge huge rates and built into those rates is the assumption that they will default. "We want all these high cost credit companies to carry out affordability checks. If people can't afford them they shouldn't really be offered the loans." And the pressure does seem to be ramping up on high cost credit companies. The government is planning tighter regulation of the industry from next April, but Labour has gone a step further by backing some form of cap, and promising a levy on the firms. That money will then be used to help develop community credit unions to provide low cost alternatives. But some believe the idea is unworkable. Phil Hall from the ifs University College, which specialises in financial education, says credit unions will never be a substitute because they require people to save before they can lend He also believes the high cost credit industry is already well-supervised. He said: "The fixation with huge APR rates for payday lenders is very misleading because APRs are annual, payday loans are not. Often it is cheaper to borrow from a payday lender than to dip into an unauthorised overdraft or to take out a lengthy bank loan but these basic facts appears to be lost on policymakers. "The government should be cracking down on illegal lending and loan sharks rather than directing misguided attention to what is already a well regulated market." And those who work in the industry believe they provide a vital service. Julio Martino runs a local payday loan shop in Newcastle. He says he does check people's ability to pay and charges realistic interest rates. He said: "I think it is important businesses do not charge ridiculous interest rates but we do have to charge a rate that allows us to make money. We are not a bank, or building society or a huge financial organisation so we cannot charge APRs similar to credit cards. "We are essentially lending to people who cannot get credit from banks, and companies like mine are willing to take a slightly greater risk to lend to these people who do need credit." But the researchers at Durham University believe people can be given help to avoid unmanageable debt. They worked with community organisation Thrive Teesside to provide mentors for low income families to guide them. That helped many, and some now do use credit unions. Eleanor Eamens has also drawn a line under her loans. She'll be debt-free by January and has begun saving with her local credit union. She says she'll never go back to high cost credit. But with the high cost credit industry worth many hundreds of millions of pounds, will it ever be possible - or even desirable - to wean people off the payday and doorstep lender? </body>

      <title>VIDEO: Food scandal 'could happen again'</title>
      <description>With cuts to food inspection and reports of increasing fraud, can the public be confident the food we eat is what we think it is?</description>

      <body>With cuts to front line inspectors and reports of increasing food fraud, can the public be confident about food standards following the recent horse meat scandal? Food writer Jay Rayner investigates how well food producers and retailers have responded and visits Tesco's laboratories in Wolverhampton to see what the retailer is doing to improve testing. But the industry is vast and the system of keeping it under control is complex. A new report by the National Audit Office has found the public's expectations about the authenticity of food are not being matched by the effectiveness of controls in place. Andy Foster from the Trading Standards Institute says the inspection system is "creaking" and in his view "the horse meat scandal could happen again". The Food Standards Agency says the current financial environment is challenging but it has invested considerably more in the last year to boost efforts and resources to detect problems.

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <title>Jumpergate - the story that wasn't</title>
      <description>Cameron says wear a jumper to save fuel bills. Except he doesn't.</description>

      <body>This week at Westminster has been dominated by one topic: energy prices. It is a case study of the biggest theme in politics at the moment, the cost of living. With British Gas joining energy provider SSE in hiking its prices, what are people feeling the squeeze and fearing the cold supposed to do? Enter, stage left, the humble jumper. And welcome to a brief snapshot of how headlines sometimes appear despite what might have emerged out of the lips of politicians and their advisers. Energy Secretary Ed Davey spent much of Thursday touring TV and radio studios criticising British Gas and suggesting people should shop around for the best energy deal. In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight, he was asked about what happened in the Davey household. Did Mr Davey, presenter Jeremy Paxman asked, wear a jumper? "I am sure people do wear jumpers, I wear jumpers at home, but you are missing the point here Jeremy, we do need to help people with their bills, I am extremely worried about them, we can use competition the way we have, we can make our homes warmer and use less electricity and gas by going more energy efficient," said Mr Davey. Cue headlines suggesting the energy secretary said wear a jumper. Great story. Except he didn't say this. Mr Davey was asked about jumpers. Mr Davey mentioned jumpers. But Mr Davey didn't say you or I should wear a jumper. Fast forward 12 hours to Friday's briefing for Westminster journalists, which is conducted by one of the prime minister's official spokesmen. The Daily Mirror - which is no fan of the coalition government - chased this theme with some vigour. The clear aim of the questions was to attempt to get an answer along the lines of "the prime minister tells you to wear jumper". If he'd said that, I'd have been jumping at the chance to get on the television, radio and online to tell it. But he didn't. Here is the exchange, as I scribbled it in my notebook: Reporter: "Does the prime minister wear a jumper at home?" Official Spokesman: "The prime minister doesn't tend to give fashion tips." Several further questions along the same lines came along, which didn't get very far. The spokesman was then asked about what the PM thought of charities giving advice that perhaps people should consider wrapping up warm. Here was the response: "Clearly, he is not going to prescribe necessarily the actions individuals should take about that. But if people are giving that advice, that is something that people may wish to consider." Next came the headlines claiming the prime minister was suggesting people should wear a jumper. Great story. Except the spokesman did not say this. Labour leapt at the chance to have their say, claiming Downing Street was in chaos and offering Ed Miliband for interview. Downing Street then issued a statement: "To be clear, it is entirely false to suggest the Prime Minister would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm. Any suggestion to the contrary is mischief-making." And so concludes the story of a story which isn't really a story at all. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Migrants and asylum in the EU</title>
      <description>What are the pressures on Europe from non-EU migrants fleeing war and poverty?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24583286</url>

      <body>The arrival of boatloads of poor and desperate migrants in Europe has put pressure on the EU to find a solution. Hundreds of non-EU migrants have drowned off the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa this month, after fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. How big is the migration challenge affecting Europe now? There is no doubt that the Arab Spring has put new migration pressures on Europe, swelling the numbers of people prepared to risk their lives by crossing the Mediterranean in rickety, overcrowded boats. In 2011 the big challenge was thousands of Tunisians arriving on Lampedusa. Later it was thousands of sub-Saharan Africans fleeing the conflict in Libya. Now it is the wave of Syrians fleeing the vicious civil war in their country. Italy and Malta have appealed for more help from the EU - not for the first time. Before this summer the focus was more on Greece, because its land border with Turkey had become the biggest crossing point for illegal migrants entering the EU. The Italian government says 35,085 migrants came ashore in Italy in January-October this year, of whom 73% met the legal criteria for asylum. Lampedusa is a migrant bottleneck because it is tiny and lies closer to North Africa than to Italy itself. Italy is expanding its reception centres to a 16,000 capacity, from the current 3,000. It had closed temporary camps for migrants from war-torn Libya at the end of 2012, after the defeat of Libyan ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi. Italy's problems are shared by some of its Mediterranean neighbours. Reception centres in Greece and Malta are overcrowded and under-resourced. Both countries have been criticised by the UN refugee agency UNHCR and human rights groups, who accuse them of violating migrants' rights. There are plenty of other routes taken by irregular migrants to enter the EU and start a new life. Mainland Greece remains a major transit point - many migrants travel up through the Balkans, hoping to reach northern Europe. Many illegal migrants go undetected, so there is no overall figure for them. But in 2012 there were 344,928 detections of illegal stay in the EU, according to the EU border agency Frontex. It calls the trend "generally stable". How does the Mediterranean compare with other entry points? In 2012 the Eastern Mediterranean route - via Greece - accounted for the most detections of illegal border-crossing. There were 37,214 detections (51% of the total). But in August 2012 the numbers trying to get in that way began to fall after Greece, helped by Frontex police, beefed up security on its land border with Turkey. The figure for the Central Mediterranean route - via Italy - rose to 10,379 (14% of the total). Before the Arab Spring the Western Mediterranean route was a big challenge for Spain, as many migrant boats arrived off the Canary Islands, carrying poor sub-Saharan Africans. Since then Spain has tightened up border co-operation with Morocco and has erected fortifications around its North African enclaves - Ceuta and Melilla. In 2012 detections of illegal border-crossing totalled 6,397 on the route to Spain. People traffickers also smuggle migrants into the EU via Eastern Europe, often hiding in lorries. The numbers entering that way are smaller. Some are victims of sexual exploitation, often from the former Soviet Union. But Germany has also seen a surge in the numbers of Chechens fleeing Russia and claiming asylum. Where do most of the migrants come from? On the Central Mediterranean route this year the largest numbers have been Syrians and Eritreans, followed by Somalis. War is raging in Somalia and Syria, and Italian officials believe many of the migrants are genuine asylum seekers, fleeing persecution. In the case of Eritrea, it appears many are young men fleeing compulsory military service, which has been likened to slavery. Eritrea is blighted by political repression, human rights groups say. In 2012 the largest number of asylum applications in the EU came from Afghans - 28,010. The other major countries of origin were Russia (24,285), Syria (21,100), Pakistan (19,685), Serbia (19,060) and Somalia (14,270). It is important to remember that huge numbers of EU citizens move from one EU country to another freely. They are also described as "migrants", but they are fully protected by EU law, unless they are fugitive criminals. Their status is quite different from that of non-EU migrants. In some EU countries, including the UK, they have become an issue because of pressure on social services and competition for jobs. Most EU countries are in the Schengen zone, which has made it much easier to cross borders without having to show a passport or other papers. How is the EU reacting to the current migrant problem? For years the EU has been struggling to harmonise asylum policy. That is difficult with 28 member states, each with their own police force and judiciary. More detailed joint rules have been brought in with the Common European Asylum System - but rules are one thing, putting them into practice EU-wide is another challenge. The Dublin Regulation is a core principle for handling asylum claims in the EU. It says responsibility for examining the claim lies primarily with the member state which played the greatest part in the applicant's entry or residence in the EU. Often that is the first EU country that the migrant reached - but not always, as in many cases migrants want to be reunited with family members, for example in the UK or the Netherlands. There are tensions in the EU over the Dublin Regulation - Greece complained that it was inundated with applications, as so many migrants arrived in Greece first. Finland and Germany are among several countries that have stopped sending migrants back to Greece. The EU also has the Eurodac system - a common database of asylum seekers' fingerprints, which can be accessed under strict controls. Police use it to intercept false or multiple claims. The European Commission has urged EU governments to expand the Mediterranean surveillance operation "from Spain to Cyprus", to prevent more boat tragedies. Frontex has only a few aircraft and boats off Italy - the agency's entire annual budget is 86m euros (£73m; $118m). Italy is stepping up its maritime patrols and the EU has agreed to launch a data exchange system in December, called Eurosur, to detect illegal migrant boats faster. How do migrants get asylum status in the EU? They have to satisfy the authorities that they are fleeing persecution and would face harm or even death if sent back to their country of origin. International law provides that protection for genuine refugees. The ban on mass "push-backs" - also known as "non-refoulement" - is an EU principle. In some cases it has not been respected, however. Before the Libya uprising the Italian government of Silvio Berlusconi routinely prevented migrant boats coming ashore, without processing asylum seekers. Greece has been accused of similar actions in the past. Under EU rules, an asylum seeker has the right to food, first aid and shelter in a reception centre. They should get an individual assessment of their needs. They can apply for asylum after giving fingerprints and being interviewed by a trained case worker. They may be granted asylum by the authorities at "first instance". If unsuccessful they can appeal against the decision in court, and may win. Asylum seekers are supposed to be granted the right to a job within nine months of arrival. The European Commission - the EU's executive - says there is still too much variation in the way EU states handle asylum claims. For example, the recognition rate for Sudanese asylum seekers is 2% in Spain, but 68% in Italy, the Commission says. How many asylum applications are successful? In 2012 there were 335,365 asylum applications in the EU - a rise on 2011. Germany ranked first, handling a quarter of the total applications. Nearly three-quarters of first instance rulings were negative, so just over a quarter of the applications were successful. Of the successful ones, 52% got refugee status - granted for those who have fled persecution. The others got "subsidiary protection" - meaning they would not be sent back, as that would put them in danger. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>Boris Johnson wins Chinese fans on six-day tour</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. The government believes it needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <description>More 'plebgate' allegations in growing power struggle</description>

      <body>Tonight yet another serious allegation in what is fast becoming a power struggle between the police and Parliament. An allegation that chief constables overruled a proposal to charge their own men with misconduct. An allegation that - once again - centres on the way Andrew Mitchell was forced from his Cabinet job for calling an officer a "f***ng pleb" - something he insists he never actually said. The minister's fate was effectively sealed after that fateful night in Downing Street when a couple of weeks later he met three representatives of the Police Federation. They stand accused of lying about what was said by Mr Mitchell at that meeting by none other than the Prime Minister himself. "Fortunately, this meeting was recorded, so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue," David Cameron told MPs. The officers have been effectively cleared of misconduct by their bosses - the Chief Constables of West Mercia, the West Midlands and Warwickshire - who found there was insufficient evidence against them. But the prime minister is echoing the police watchdog in declaring that to be wrong. Tonight the Independent Police Complaints Commission has gone even further revealing that the police forces involved changed their minds about their own investigation. A letter from the IPCC's deputy Chair states that: "I note that in the first draft ...the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude there was a case to answer for misconduct although their final report submitted in August did not" MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee have asked the three chief constables involved to come down to Westminster to help them with their enquiries into what on earth went on. "The fact that there is now indications of a second report - the first having been changed - is a serious alteration to the story and we need to look carefully at why there was that change," its Labour chair Keith Vaz has said. What might seem a horribly complex story is in fact rather simple. A growing number of politicians suspect the police have been systematically covering up wrong doing by those in their own ranks. </body>

      <title>Elderly care all sorted? Think again...</title>
      <description>Many pensioners face significant fees before they get help</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24534268</url>
      <date>1381842445</date>

      <body>When the government unveiled its plans for a £72,000 cap on elderly care costs from 2016, ministers were quick to claim they had solved the problem. The era of huge bills for care, an issue which resulted in tens of thousands of people selling their own homes each year, was over, they said. But as politicians and campaigners sift through detail it is becoming more and more clear that all is not quite as it seems. One of the measures trumpeted by ministers was the fact that the bill individuals face could be deferred by getting councils to pay for the care and then allowing them to recoup it from an individual's estate after their death. This option is already available in some areas, but under the changes every council would have to offer it, they said. But it has now emerged the option of deferring payments will not be open to wealthier people. Only those needing residential care who have assets of less than £23,250 (excluding the value of their home) will be able to get their local council to pay the costs. For example, it means someone with £50,000 in the bank when they enter a care home will have to pay the bills as they come in until that has been reduced to £23,250. Only then will they be able to defer the costs. Labour peer Lord Lipsey believes this is such a significant loophole that it amounts to a "sabotaging" of the safeguards. The £72,000 cap will not include the amount an individual pays for the "hotel costs" of a care home - that is to say the normal cost of daily living such as food, energy bills and the accommodation. Under the reforms, these so-called "hotel costs" will be set at £12,000 a year. For a typical care home place that accounts for about a third of the fees. Therefore, it would mean that an individual could find themselves paying over £100,000 over three years (£72,000 in care fees and £36,000 in hotel costs) before the cap kicks in. And once it does they will still be liable for the £12,000-a-year hotel costs until their wealth is whittled away. With any system, there is always winners and losers. In this case it is those in the middle. The poorest will continue to get social care free as they do now. But those with assets of over £118,000 (including the value of property) will be liable for care home costs until they reach the £72,000 cap or their assets fall below the £118,000-mark. It means those with assets of between £150,000 and £200,000 face losing between a third and nearly a half of their in care costs. That compares to 0% for people with below £17,000 and a sixth for those with £500,000. Those even wealthier than that lose even less. It will be up to local authorities to calculate how much an individual has to pay. They will do this by working out the average they pay for care home places for those who get state help. This will stop people moving into a luxury care home and racking up £72,000 in costs in super quick time. Fair enough, you might say. But the problem - recognised by the Health Select Committee earlier this year - is that councils, with the benefit of buying places in bulk, can often negotiate lower fees than an individual can. This could lead to disputes over what the true costs are. The original proposals suggested setting the cap at a much lower level. But in the end ministers came up with the figure of £72,000. This was not plucked out of thin air. Once a person enters a care home, not many live beyond two years. In that time just those requiring the most intensive care are ever likely to accrue bills in excess of £72,000. It means only an estimated one in eight people will benefit from the cap, according to estimates by the government. And that is why Age UK, which has been campaigning for years for reform of the social care funding system, sees the cap as only a start. It argues the cap only benefits those with "the greatest needs" who end up in care homes "for a considerable amount of time". </body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>

      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have? Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers. And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent. But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved? In some ways, the face of politics is changing. Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female. Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero. The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender. That isn't a misprint. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class. What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps". In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence. Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale. And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss. So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents. Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up. Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction. None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections. It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife. It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland. He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence. But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode. So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail. But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience. So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election. But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry. At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past. At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments. And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms. Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders. And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left. He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership. And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future . Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly. Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed. The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader. And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government. The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2. Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal. She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis. But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent. Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price". And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence. Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election. He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was. Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come. But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed. The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise. At least, not this side of an election. So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties. </body>

      <title>EU law and budget: a video guide</title>
      <description>Matthew Price explains EU laws and budget</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-23782683</url>

      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions. Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget. The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer. Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years. In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists. Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation. Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so. The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn). The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects. This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden. The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects. EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit. </body>
