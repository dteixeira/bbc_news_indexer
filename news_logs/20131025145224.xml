      <body>Boosting faith tourism in Wales will be a challenge, the Welsh government has admitted. Economy and Transport Minister Edwina Hart said attracting more visitors to places of worship and other sacred sites would give tourism a competitive edge. But she said increasing the £12m UK tourists already spend visiting faith venues would be difficult. It comes as the government launched its Faith Tourism Action Plan. Mrs Hart said the plan sets out a "challenging vision for exploiting the full potential of Wales places of worship". It said places of worship are already amongst the most visited attractions in Wales. Visit Wales figures showed tourists from across the UK spent £12m while visiting such venues in Wales in 2012. But the Welsh government said improving that figure would be hard because many places of worship are closed or appear closed to visitors; there is no coherence between faith tourism projects and no organisation adequately funded to promote it. The faith action plan, which was launched at St Asaph Cathedral in Denbighshire, is part of the government's wider tourism strategy. "This is the first action plan of its kind in the UK with a specific focus on faith tourism," Mrs Hart said. "Some of Wales' places of worship are truly iconic and attract huge numbers of visitors every year. This action plan will not only focus on the iconic sites. "Churches and chapels have a presence in every community and the activities within Wales' places of worship have helped shape its language, culture and way of life. Temples of all religions, holy sites and pilgrim trails also have their place." One element of the action plan is to develop a pilgrims' walking trail across south Wales to the cathedral. St Asaph Cathedral was chosen as the site for the launch of the action plan, which was welcomed by the Bishop of St Asaph, the Right Reverend Gregory Cameron. "Across this diocese we have holy sites and ancient places of worship which have been visited by pilgrims for generations and this initiative is a new opportunity to share our rich Christian heritage with locals and tourists alike," he said. A working group has been set up in order to achieve the objectives of the plan and their work will focus on promoting faith tourism, help tourism businesses to make the most of faith tourism. </body>

      <title>'Devastating' college cuts warning</title>
      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <title>Call for shorter assembly holidays</title>
      <description>Assembly members should have shorter holidays and hold an extra meeting each week, says the leader of the Welsh Conservatives.</description>

      <body>Assembly members should have shorter holidays and hold an extra meeting each week, the leader of the Welsh Conservatives says. Andrew RT Davies told BBC Wales there should be a "root and branch review" of the way the assembly operates. AMs currently hold full sessions - to question ministers and pass legislation - on a Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon. Mr Davies said an extra session could be held on Thursday mornings but the Wales Governance Centre disagrees. A recent report said proper scrutiny of the Welsh government could be achieved by increasing the number of AMs from 60 to 100. But Mr Davies said the idea of increasing the number of AMs from the current total would be "jumping the gun". He said: "Now more than ever we need a root and branch review of procedure within the Welsh parliament. "Suggestions of an increase in AM numbers are jumping the gun. "There is far more that can be done with the current number of members, and we need to get that right first." The assembly took a 10-week recess this summer and after sitting for five weeks, next week is a one-week half-term recess. Mr Davies said: "The time members spend within their constituencies and regions is extremely important and paramount to our work, while many members must also travel long distances to and from parliament. "Finding the right balance then is clearly not easy but it must be done for the benefit of Wales. "All would agree that engagement with Wales' democratic institution is worryingly low, and I hope AMs of all parties will come together to consider how we can burst the Cardiff Bay bubble." But Dr Rebecca Rumbul, manager of the Wales Governance Centre at Cardiff University, disagrees with Mr Davies' idea. "There are not enough AMs to properly hold the government to account currently and I don't believe that simply shortening recess or making committee members sit in yet another meeting will be a high quality solution to that problem," she said. "Most AMs you speak to will work a 60 hour week. When they're on recess, they're not on a nine-week Caribbean cruise, they are in their constituencies working very hard to the people that have voted them in. "I don't think increasing the hours will produce the kind of high quality democracy what we want. "Actually what we want to see is a plurality of voices and an increase in experience in the assembly and you can only capture that by increasing the number of AMs." </body>

      <body>Police are hunting a man who sexually assaulted a teenage girl in a daylight attack as she walked through a park. The attack happened next to a golf club at Bryn Bach Park, Tredegar, Blaenau Gwent, between 13:30 BST and 16:00 BST on Monday. The 16-year-old girl was walking past the club with a friend when a man rode up on a bike, assaulted her and rode off. A Gwent Police spokesman said he was in his 30s with prominent black eyebrows. The girl described him as dressed in black and having a partially covered face. "He was wearing an army camouflage print snood covering the bottom half of his face and a black hat/hood on his head which still exposed prominent black eyebrows," Gwent Police said. "He was also wearing a black raincoat, black trousers and black shoes." </body>

      <body>Changes to improve Powys council's services will have to be made more quickly because of the latest round of funding cuts, its cabinet says. The authority will see a £9m funding cut in 2014/15 and with £11m in increased service pressures, it said it is left with a £20m funding shortfall. Four main aspects are being looked at as part of the changes. They include changing the way it delivers services, management structures, and reducing service costs. "The latest budget news with its 4.6% cut in funding shows how essential it is that the transformation continues and accelerates," leader David Jones said. "Service demands are increasing, costs are rising and our funding is falling and without change we will not deliver." He added: "This approach will ensure that we have the right services where needed, that we build a sustainable and efficient delivery network with our partners where necessary and that our citizens feel engaged in their local services." Councils the length and breadth of Wales are trying to work out the best ways of dealing with unprecedented cuts. Funding for Ceredigion, Denbighshire and Powys will fall by 4.6% but Newport will only experience a 1.2% cut. Prior to the announcement earlier this month, the Welsh Local Government Association(WLGA) warned that most councils were unprepared for the scale of cuts. </body>

      <body>Police have ended their search for a man who sexually assaulted three girls in the pool of Swansea's main leisure centre. The girls - aged eight, nine and 15 - were targeted by a man in the LC in Oystermouth Road on 21 August. The centre was closed for a short time following the incident while police searched the premises, and detectives at South Wales Police have since studied CCTV footage. Officers said nobody had been found. "Despite an extensive investigation into allegations of indecent behaviour at the LC in Swansea in August, no culprit has been identified and in the absence of any new information the matter has been finalised," a spokesperson said. Nic Beggs, general manager of the LC, said extra CCTV had been installed since the incident and staff had received extra training from the police. He added: "We have been working closely with the police since this incident took place and we are clearly disappointed no one has been apprehended. "We take a zero tolerance approach to inappropriate behaviour and have made a number of improvements in recent months to increase customer safety." Officers described the suspect as tanned with collar-length brown hair, unshaven, and wearing black or blue knee-length board shorts. Anyone with any information should call Swansea Central CID on 01792 450618 or 101 or Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111. </body>

      <title>Flood risk as more rain forecast</title>
      <description>Heavy rain could lead to more localised flooding in parts of Wales over the coming days, Natural Resources Wales warns.</description>

      <body>Heavy rain could lead to localised flooding in parts of Wales over the coming days, Natural Resources Wales (NRW) is warning. It follows a yellow 'be aware' alert on Friday morning for rain across much of south and south west Wales which was issued by the Met Office. NRW said the forecast for the whole of Wales remained unsettled for Sunday and Monday. Last weekend, downpours led to flash flooding in parts of Cardiff. "With ground remaining saturated from rainfall during the week, water may quickly find its way into streams, ditches and rivers with the potential for localised flooding," said a NRW spokesperson. "With leaves littering pavements and roads, there is also a risk that blocked drains will cause flooding of road surfaces, causing traffic disruption. "Officers will be monitoring river levels closely over the weekend, checking they are clear of blockages and making sure that flood defences are operating efficiently." The Met Office yellow warning for rain came into force just after midnight, and remains in place until 10:00 BST on Friday morning. It covers Cardiff, Swansea, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Newport, Merthyr Tydfil, Caerphilly, Blaenau Gwent, Bridgend, Vale of Glamorgan, Neath Port Talbot, Torfaen, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire. Forecasters say nearly an inch of rain (20mm) could fall as a band of heavy cloud moves north-east across southern Wales, with over an inch of rain (30mm) on higher ground. On Saturday, flash flooding in parts of Cardiff saw police close roads around Ely and Culverhouse Cross. Shoppers at the Marks and Spencer store in Culverhouse Cross had to be evacuated when water entered the shop, but some remained stranded in the car park for up to two hours. The nearby Tesco store also had to be evacuated due to flooding. NRW urged members of the public to "keep an eye" on weather forecasts over the weekend, and check flood alerts, which are updated every 15 minutes on its website. Updates are also available on the NRW Floodline on 0845 988 1188 and through NRW's Twitter account, @natreswales. </body>

      <title>Swansea draw a fair result - Laudrup</title>
      <description>Manager Michael Laudrup says his Swansea side's draw with Russian side Kuban Krasnodar is a fair result.</description>

      <body>Manager Michael Laudrup said Swansea's draw with Kuban Krasnodar was a fair result, despite the frustration of seeing his side concede a last-minute equaliser. Michu gave the Swans the lead before Djibril Cisse's penalty made it 1-1. The result meant Swansea dropped points for the first time in their debut Europa League campaign. "If you look at the game overall, I have to admit the draw was a fair result," said Laudrup Swansea remain top of Group A, one point ahead of Valencia with three games remaining. Laudrup has stated he believes 10 or 11 points will ensure they qualify for the knockout stages. The Dane conceded he was frustrated by his side's inability to hold on for maximum points but praised the Russians' performance. "When you are 1-0 up in injury-time and you have the ball, you think it's done," said Laudrup. "If you look at the way we conceded the goal - a penalty after a counter-attack in injury-time - it is frustrating. "We had a lot of possession, like we do, but we did not create that many chances. They were very dangerous on the counter-attack, which we knew before the game. "In the first half, they had three or four very dangerous counter-attacks. So overall a draw is fair." Laudrup refused to blame any of his players for the penalty, despite Jonjo Shelvey losing the ball in midfield and goalkeeper Gerhard Tremmel bringing down substitute Ibrahima Balde for the spot-kick. "We don't point fingers at anybody here," said Laudrup. "We are still learning and very few of my players have played international games. "Yes, we play in the Premier League but this is a process and I think this will give us a lot of experience. To get experience you have to make mistakes, but you learn from them." </body>

      <title>Extra funding for Wales from HS2</title>
      <description>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury concedes.</description>

      <body>Wales will receive tens of millions of pounds in extra funding as a result of the High Speed 2 rail link, the Treasury has conceded. It had initially rejected Finance Minister Jane Hutt's announcement that Wales would get extra cash stemming from spending on the project in 2015. The Welsh government said it was "pleased the position is now clear". But the spending commitment of around £35m in that year is not guaranteed for the lifetime of the project. The Treasury suggested it may change the funding formula in the future. HS2 is a controversial new high speed rail link proposed to run from London to Birmingham from 2026, with branches to Manchester and Leeds via Sheffield planned for 2033, at an estimated cost of £42.5bn. UK government ministers have always maintained that the project is of UK-wide significance. This would mean the devolved nations should not get extra payments which are normally due to them for transport projects in England. The 2015 extra cash will put pressure on the Treasury to maintain the payments throughout the next decade - which could bring in up to £2bn for the Welsh budget. But the Chancellor is able to change the funding formula at his discretion, which means that in future years the system could be adjusted to exclude any additional cash for Wales. The Welsh government is likely to campaign strongly to continue to receive the extra funding beyond 2015. It confirmed it had received a share of £832m to be spent on the HS2 scheme by the Department for Transport in 2015-16. Speaking to BBC Wales on Thursday, Finance Minister Jane Hutt said the Welsh government was "very clear" on the matter. She said that this episode demonstrated how the way the Welsh government is funded "needs reform". The Welsh government receives a slice of the extra money that is spent in England on services that are devolved in Wales, such as health or education, what is known as "Barnett consequentials". That process would normally include transport spending, but Treasury officials had always maintained Wales would not get more cash as a result of extra spending on HS2 because they say the project benefits the entire UK. The issue of Wales receiving part of this money has been at the centre of a bitter political wrangle in recent years. Ms Hutt's statement to the assembly's finance committee on Monday - where she informed members of the extra cash coming to Wales - was welcomed as a breakthrough by campaigners from across the political spectrum. She told AMs there would be £84m extra in 2015-16, because of a £2bn increase in the Department for Transport's overall budget, which includes £832m spent on HS2. A Treasury spokesperson said the Welsh government had received a "capital consequential" of £84.5m. "This was based on a £2bn increase in the total Department for Transport capital budget," said the Treasury. Figures obtained by the BBC under a freedom of information request showed that Cardiff could potentially lose £70m in economic output once a high speed rail link opened between London and the north of England. </body>

      <title>Griffiths on Wales' World Cup chances</title>
      <description>Former Wales head coach Clive Griffiths thinks Wales can do well in the Rugby League World Cup, despite a likely opening onslaught from Italy</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/wales/24615347</url>

      <body>Clive Griffiths is a name synonymous with Welsh rugby league. The former St Helens player was in charge of Wales for two memorable World Cup campaigns in 1995 and 2000. Wales lost 25-10 to England in that 1995 semi-final and a side captained by Iestyn Harris gave Australia an almighty scare before losing 46-22 at the same stage five years later. Griffiths has also spent a spell as assistant to current head coach Harris, who has been in charge of the national side since 2009. Here, North Wales Crusaders head coach Griffiths looks forward to Wales' fourth World Cup campaign, which begins against Italy at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday. "Iestyn's still pretty young as a coach. He's very cool, as he was as a player. I get a bit more animated than Iestyn but we're all different in styles. "He knows the game inside-out and all he needs now is the coaching experience to go with it and the man-management skills which develop as you go along. "Iestyn is learning the hard way. The Crusaders was a tough baptism for him in their final season in Super League. I think he's done the right thing going to assist at Wigan Warriors. He couldn't be at a better rugby league club than Wigan and with time he will be one of the top coaches. "He's got a great chap assisting him in Lee Briers. They're two half-backs who know how the game should be played. "They've been in the fast lane of international rugby and Super League rugby for many a year so there are no better people to put forward that experience and the way of playing the game. "They gave me everything as players and I've got nothing but admiration for them. I've got no doubt these boys will go on to greater things." "There are more Super League players now in the Wales squad than there have been for a long time. It's similar to 1995, when we had players from throughout the game - the Warrington boys, the St Helens connection and the Widnes boys. "Players like Ben Flower and Gil Dudson (both Wigan Warriors) plus Jordan James (Salford Red Devils) are in the fast lane of forward play down the middle. You can see how they've come on as players since they moved up into the higher level. "They've got the foundation; they've got a good forward pack. Our half-backs, number nine and hooker need to guide us around the pitch and make sure everyone's going forward in the right manner. "We've got to keep everyone healthy. People are bound to get injured but we just want to try and get the best team out we possibly can for those games. "I know how fantastic it is to be involved [in the World Cup] and you've got to transfer that to the players. It will be special for them." "Italy will be absolutely buoyed by their 15-14 warm-up match win against England. I couldn't believe the result. "It's the best thing that could have happened to Wales because this could have happened to Wales in our first game. "Everybody now will be totally on their guard and ready for an onslaught from Italy and we'll have a bit more respect for them. "It's going to be a mouth-watering encounter. I still think Wales will win it, but I don't think it's going to be as easy as everyone thought initially. "I don't know how long Italy have been together but they've obviously got some good players in the right positions and they seemed to have gelled pretty quickly. "I think we'll beat the United States and the Cook Islands with something to spare. We played the Cook Islands in 2000 at the Racecourse in Wrexham on a filthy night. It was only 6-6 at half-time but we went away to win by 38-6 in the end and I think it will be a similar tale. "They got absolutely slaughtered by a New Zealand team that were missing five or six of their probable starting line-up. The signs aren't good for the Cook Islands. It will be physical but I think Wales will come through it." "There's no reason why we can't do well. They will get to the quarter-finals, I'm pretty sure of that. "England or Australia in the quarter-final at Wrexham is quite an incentive; the carrot's dangling for the players. You want to play the best as a player, and it's going to be interesting whoever we play in that quarter-final. "With a bit of luck and some good decisions going their way there's no reason why we shouldn't get to the semi-final. As you saw in 2000, anything can happen and it's all on the day. It's cup-tie rugby. We can but dream." Clive Griffiths was talking to BBC Wales Sport's Aled Williams. </body>

      <body>Plans to demolish the ITV Wales studios at Culverhouse Cross near Cardiff and build homes on the site have been rejected by councillors. There were proposals to build 243 new houses on the site but there were objections to the project. Vale of Glamorgan councillors narrowly rejected the application at a meeting on Thursday. ITV Wales wants to relocate to Assembly Square, next door to the Senedd building, in Cardiff Bay in 2014. The plans submitted by the broadcaster were recommended for approval by council officers, subject to a number of conditions including highway improvements and funding for schools and community facilities. But the chairman of the Vale of Glamorgan council's development committee, Councillor Frederick Johnson, has confirmed the committee narrowly rejected the application. A motion to defer the application for further talks with the developers was also rejected. Mr Johnson said he was disappointed with the outcome. "It's a sad day," he said. ITV Wales wants to relocate around 100 staff from Culverhouse Cross to Cardiff Bay by June next year. But some of the other media companies based at the Culverhouse Cross site have campaigned against the house building proposals. ITV Wales has been at Culverhouse Cross since 1984. </body>

      <body>The death of an elderly woman in Conwy county is no longer being treated as suspicious, police have said. North Wales Police arrested a 63-year-old man on suspicion of murder on Wednesday, after a woman's body was found at her home in Penlan, Deganwy. On Thursday, following a post-mortem examination, the force said the death was not being treated as suspicious and the man had been released from custody. Supt Steve Williams said the force was "satisfied" with its actions. He said: "A review of the arrest has been conducted and we are satisfied that this was the correct course of action to take based on the circumstances that presented themselves at the time."

      <body>A main road in Snowdonia closed after a landslip covered it in about 30 tonnes of debris has reopened. The A498 was shut both ways on Wednesday between Beddgelert and Penygwryd while the carriageway was cleared. Officers used specialised equipment to remove the debris from the road, which now has temporary traffic lights in place. The landslip happened following a prolonged spell of heavy rain. A spokesman for the council said: "As part of the initial safety works on the site, concrete safety barriers are being installed. "The traffic management system will remain in place until further stabilisation work is completed at the site. "The council is currently making attempts to contact the relevant landowner before these additional safety works are carried out." The council has also spoken to the organisers of the Snowdonia Marathon, which takes place in the area on Saturday, who say the route will not be affected. </body>

      <body>A man has been arrested on suspicion of indecent assault at children's homes in north Wales. The 66-year-old is being questioned in connection with offences against three boys, between 1975 and 1977, when they were aged between 10 and 14. The man was arrested in St Leonards on Sea, East Sussex, as part of Operation Pallial, the investigation into allegations of historical sexual abuse in the north Wales care system. He is the 13th person to be arrested. A 53-year-old man arrested by police on Wednesday, 16 October has been released on bail. The man, from Connah's Quay, was questioned about three alleged sexual offences in the 1980s involving a boy aged between 12 and 14. The National Crime Agency launched Operation Pallial last November to look at allegations relating to 18 care homes between 1963 and 1992. One person has so far been charged with a large number of serious sexual offences. </body>

      <body>A former mayor has been sentenced to 18 years in prison for a series of explosions in Denbigh which a neighbour described as sounding like a "battlefield". John Larsen, 46, got a "thrill" from his actions, which had the potential to kill, Caernarfon Crown Court was told. The explosions happened in the Lenten Pool area from January to April. In the most serious incident, he blew up a Land Rover, showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area. Larsen was found guilty earlier on Thursday of three counts of arson, one of causing an explosion likely to endanger life and another of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said it was "a very unusual case and these are very serious offences". Larsen was mayor of Denbigh in 1999 and was a town councillor at the time of his arrest. The trial heard Lenten Pool was plagued by the sound of loud bangs, with incidents taking place two or three times a week culminating in a main attack on a Land Rover in March. Larsen was arrested by police at his nearby home on 19 April. North Wales Police found a manual on pyrotechnics in his house, a computer file named "gunpowder mix", modified fireworks and rockets, and ball-bearings. He told officers he had a legitimate interest in fireworks and had bought some materials online. But the court was told Larsen got a "thrill from what he was doing and the attention it was generating." Resident Shirley Clarke told the trial: "People often said they were fireworks - they were not fireworks. "They were humongous. They were more than fireworks, it was like a bomb." In evidence another neighbour, Trevor Jones, said the noise was like a battlefield - and the bangs and explosions became gradually louder, sounding like artillery fire. The blast under the Land Rover on 24 March showered ball-bearings and shrapnel over a large area, smashing windows. One resident found that a ball-bearing had hit a headboard on their bed. An explosives expert said the ball-bearings had either been packed or strapped onto the device and would have been ejected from the bomb at "several hundred metres per second" with the potential to cause serious injury or even death to any passers-by. Larsen denied the charges throughout his trial. The former stonemason, who stopped working in 2004 after injuring his back, said his hobbies were photography, fireworks and "hand magic". He said he made "fireworks, not bombs". Prior to his arrest, Larsen gave interviews to the media, including BBC Wales, saying how people were "terrified" by the "scary" the situation. After the hearing, Det Ch Insp Andrew Williams said: "During this period, John Larsen came to the fore as a local leader and the community trusted him. "He betrayed that trust in a terrible way and he now faces the consequences of his actions." </body>

      <body>The former chief executive of Wrexham FC, Paul Retout, has been given a 16-month jail sentence for a £60,000 fraud. Retout, 53, admitted submitting false invoices to London-based company Quadrangle Group in 2007 and 2008 while a partner with the firm. Kingston Crown Court heard that he had started at the group in 1989 as a financial controller. He stepped down from Wrexham football club in 2010. The court was told on Thursday that Retout made claims for work he had not done, blaming his "chaotic" family life after moving to north Wales. "You were not acting dishonestly from the outset, but you became dishonest when you later invoiced and obtained money for work you had not done and for which you were not entitled, money obtained from the partnership," Judge Nicholas Jones told Retout. The judge said he also accepted that the ex-football club boss, who had his family home in Ruthin in Denbighshire, had shown remorse for his actions. Retout is also expecting to be stripped of his professional standing as a chartered accountant, the court heard. He pleaded guilty to committing fraud by abuse of position at a court hearing last month. The court was told that Retout obtained £59,806 as result of his fake invoices, and also carrying out work which had not been authorised in advance by the firm. A civil legal case with Quadrangle has been settled, and Retout has also made part-repayment of the defrauded money. </body>

      <body>The proposed merger of two Denbighshire Catholic schools could be put on hold as councillors consider a new option. It had been proposed that St Brigid's in Denbigh and Blessed Edward Jones in Rhyl should close, to be replaced by a new multi-faith school on two sites. Instead, Denbighshire councillors will be asked to consider working with the Anglican and Catholic diocese to create a single site on an undecided location. The council's cabinet will vote on the proposal at a meeting next week. More than 1,300 people responded to a consultation, which showed very little support for the original proposals. A new, single site would mean the closure of both existing faith schools, possibly by 2018. Anna Gresty, of St Brigid's Action Group, said: "Having read the council's summary of responses to this consultation, we weren't surprised at the overwhelming response against the proposals to merge St Brigid's School and Blessed Edward Jones as one school 12 miles apart." Tony Hannigan, chair of governors at St Brigid's School, said: "St Brigid's School is very pleased to have been told in a meeting with Denbighshire County Council officers, that they have listened to our concerns and will recommend councillors drop plans for a 'one school on two sites' model involving St Brigid's and Blessed Edward Jones in 2014." However, he said there was concern that plans to build a new school, adding that it would "represent much greater value for money for the taxpayer to use the existing sites and build on their successes". Earlier this year, pupils at St Brigid's made on online film to campaign to keep the school as it is. </body>

      <body>A health trust has admitted failings in the care of an 18-year-old Kent student with a history of mental health problems who killed herself. Lauren Smith, of Canterbury, was found dead at the University in Wales Trinity St David's Lampeter campus in 2012. Her mother, Laura Smith, said she had been left "heartbroken" and did not want the situation to be repeated. Kent and Medway NHS Trust said a review found "more could have been done" to support her transfer to Wales. Lauren, who had a history of self-harming, was weeks into the first year of her humanities degree when she took her own life at the university halls of residence in Lampeter on 17 November 2012. Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton recorded a verdict of suicide while suffering severe depressive illness, at an inquest into her death in Aberystwyth. The inquest was told she was not getting the mental health care she should have been receiving. Ms Smith said there was a lack of support for teenagers with a history of mental health and they were at risk of "slipping through the cracks" when they turned 18, left home or moved to university. She added: "I was given a false sense of security by assuming risk assessments were being carried out, that my concerns as her mother were being recorded, and that information and records were being shared between agencies. "There seems to be complacency among mental health professionals when it comes to adolescent mental health - for instance, I was told by one hospital psychiatrist that lots of teenage girls harm themselves, it doesn't mean they're going to do anything." She added: "There were many opportunities for the outcome to have been different for Lauren. "We will never know this for sure, but I hope that other vulnerable young people and their families can be spared the additional agony of what ifs? by ensuring that further deaths of those slipping through the cracks - as they transition between Child and Adolescent Mental Health and Adult Services - are prevented." A spokeswoman for Kent and Medway NHS Trust said: "Following Lauren's death the trust conducted an immediate review of the care provided. The initial investigation concluded that record-keeping in the case was below the expected standard and the arrangements for transferring care to Wales should have been better managed. "Further review has highlighted that more could have been done to gather information from other mental health services that had seen Lauren in the past." In a statement, Hywel Dda Health Board said it had contacted Ms Smith's family "to explain that the appropriate referral to local mental health services was made for Lauren whilst she was resident in our area". A spokesman for the University in Wales Trinity St David said it had a comprehensive range of support services for students in place, which included mental health advisers, mentors and counsellors. "These services are provided as soon as the university is made aware of any support needs that our students might have," he said. He added that the university students' union also provided a student welfare service and a night-time listening service. </body>

      <body>Villagers are concerned a planned pylon route linking wind farms to the national power supply could spoil the view from a local hill. Drop-in sessions are being staged by National Grid over the 25-mile (40km) route in Powys and Shropshire until 8 November. In Llanymynech, near Welshpool, people said they feared the pylons could ruin the views across the two counties. National Grid said it was "one of the main things" concerning people. A spokeswoman said National Grid "fully understands" people's concerns in Llanymynech, adding: "That's why we're holding these events, to hear people's opinions." The pylon route would start from an electricity sub-station in Cefn Coch, near Llanfair Caereinion, and finish at the national transmission network near Oswestry in Shropshire. In addition to the pylons, National Grid has said eight miles (nearly 13km) of cables will be buried underground in the Meifod valley. The first of 26 drop-in sessions in Powys and Shropshire started on 7 October. Revealing its pylon plans in September, National Grid said a new "T-pylon" - which is about 15m (nearly 50ft) shorter than conventional pylons - could be used along the power cable route which would be 33 miles (53km) long. It said it had developed a draft route to keep away from villages and would use "hills and trees as a natural backdrop to help keep any visual impact to a minimum". The remaining drop-in sessions start next week at West Felton Village Hall, near Oswestry, and at Meifod Village Hall, near Welshpool. </body>

      <title>Parents urged to act over measles</title>
      <description>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading.</description>

      <body>Parents are being asked to urgently get their children vaccinated against measles to stop an outbreak of the disease spreading. Public Health Wales (PHW) said the number of cases linked to a Pontardawe school had risen to 13, while a case had been reported at a Swansea nursery. This outbreak comes less than four months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended - centred on the same area with 1,200 suspected cases. PHW said it was "very frustrated". "We now have cases not only in Cwmtawe school but also in two primary schools, a further education college and a nursery," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, PHW's consultant in communicable disease control. "In all of these places there are unvaccinated children and young people who could easily catch and spread measles." Health officials have already written to all parents of unvaccinated children in Cwmtawe School to urge them to arrange for their children to be vaccinated. Pupils were offered the MMR vaccination with 55 children immunised during the school session but at least 46 did not take up the offer. Dr Hoffmann added: "We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year. "We are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. "The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine." The Swansea area epidemic lasted eight months with suspected cases first reported in November 12. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash. </body>

      <body>Welsh businesses are still failing six months after a scheme was set up to compensate them after they were mis-sold financial products, claims an MP. Aberconwy Conservative MP Guto Bebb, who is leading a commons committee on the issue, said millions were being spent administering the scheme. But he said the money was not getting through to businesses which had suffered huge losses. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said cases were being speeded up. Victims claim they were not made aware of the risks of interest rate swap agreements (IRSAs) which are commonly known as swaps. "We still have businesses who are failing, not because they made the wrong decision but because they were mis-sold an inappropriate product and we really do need to get the FCA to simplify and move ahead at a much quicker pace," said Mr Bebb. About 40,000 businesses across the UK are thought to be affected. Some people attended a rally at Westminster before a Commons debate on the plight of small businesses on Thursday, including Pembrokeshire farmer Carwyn James who is owed £180,000 by Barclays. He is critical of the attitude of banks, not just for selling him the swap in the first place, but also for the way they kept on charging him extra banking fees while he was in trouble. "There was conscious process of piling it on, waiting for us to pop," Mr James said. "A short-term money-making attitude, that is the worst thing they have done, instead of helping businesses they finished them. We were at their mercy and it was open season." In response, Barclays said it had built a quick and clearly defined "consequential loss assessment process" which was now in full swing. "If a customer submits a claim within 40 days of their redress offer, we will review and provide them with a final redress offer within 28 days of receipt of their claim," said Barclays. "We would encourage those who haven't yet responded to do so shortly so that their reviews can commence." Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) Wales spokesman Iestyn Davies said the swaps mis-selling put businesses under an unbearable strain when they were also struggling with the recession. "Businesses have closed, they've gone to the wall and failed. "But, more importantly, individuals' health has suffered, relationships have suffered and there has been lasting damage done as well to the credibility banks have as trusted advisors to small businesses," he said. "These actions were immoral they were probably illegal but more importantly they are things which have caused people to be damaged as individuals. "We need them to have the redress they deserve to be put back in the position they were in before these products were sold to them." The FCA said cases it hoped most would be reviewed by the end of the year. It said it was encouraged that some banks announced this week they would start paying compensation in separate stages - effectively fast tracking compensation payments. </body>

      <title>Broadband firm grants suspended</title>
      <description>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm are suspended after complaints about a patchy service.</description>

      <body>Grants to help people sign up for broadband with a Carmarthenshire firm have been suspended. It follows complaints from ResQNet customers that they had been left with a patchy and inconsistent service. The Cross Hands company has received almost £900,000 in public cash from a government scheme to provide high-speed internet access in so-call 'not-spots'. ResQNet vowed to upgrade its network by the end of October. Grants for other broadband providers are not affected. The firm received funding as part of the Wales Broadband Support Scheme, which makes £1,000 grants available to households unable to access broadband connections. The money is typically paid directly to suppliers, so residents do not have to pay up front for equipment and connection costs. Customers from various parts of Carmarthenshire have told BBC Wales they were promised broadband connection speeds of around 5Mbps by ResQNet, but say they have faced a disrupted and a patchy service in recent months. John Sydney, from Taliaris near Llandeilo, said he had now cancelled his subscription to ResQNet because of his frustration with the service. He said he was pleased with the internet speed initially being provided by ResQNet, but then the broadband connection deteriorated around six months ago. "We've had very, very slow speeds and a lot of disconnections," he said. "It's on and off all the time. All of a sudden you couldn't do things online... it was quite frustrating." He said the Welsh government "should be checking on the supplier... to make sure he's fulfilling his part of the contract". Another customer, Roger Thomas, from Cwmdu near Llandeilo, has gone back to using an old, and slower service, because he said ResQNet was too unreliable. "£24 pounds a months is a lot of money for a service that doesn't work," he said. BBC Wales has been made aware of more problems with services in the village of Llanedi, between Cross Hands and Pontarddulais. ResQNet's own website indicates a series of technical problems and upgrades to the service, while a Facebook page has been set up by frustrated ResQNet customers. The company declined to be interviewed by BBC Wales, but in a statement said work would soon be completed to increase network capacity and upgrades to the wireless network. ResQNet director Clive Downey said that the internet usage they were experiencing was "was way beyond what we expected". In its statement, the company added: "We appreciate there have been service issues on parts of our network due to the increased need for bandwidth combined with the success of the service. "The planned increase in the capacity of the network has been delayed but its implementation by the end of October will help alleviate the current issues for the customers affected. ResQNet said it was a "small, innovative business" that over the last two-and-a-half years had provided broadband services where other "major players have failed". "We are committed to continue this trend and overcome the obstacles that will come along from time to time by continued investment and innovation and provide broadband users in west Wales with real choices," it added. "We are also more aware of its limitations and our business strategy will now reflect this new found knowledge whilst being very aware of the importance this service is to the areas concerned. The company said customers affected by the current issues would be compensated under the terms of their contract, and some had already been paid. The Welsh government said it was "unacceptable" that customers had been let down, after it had paid £892,000 in grants to residents and businesses who had identified ResQNet as their broadband service provider.

      <title>Greenpeace piracy charges 'dropped'</title>
      <description>Greenpeace activists held in Russia over a protest against Arctic oil drilling face lesser charges of hooliganism rather than piracy, officials say.</description>

      <body>Russia has dropped piracy charges against 30 Greenpeace activists, replacing them with hooliganism charges, according to officials. The new charge has a maximum penalty of seven years rather than 15. Greenpeace says it is still "wildly disproportionate". Greenpeace's Arctic Sunrise vessel was seized by Russian forces as activists tried to scale an offshore oil platform. All 30 people on board were detained. Two of them are freelance journalists. So far all bail applications in the case have been refused. Vladimir Markin, the head of Russia's main investigating agency the Investigative Committee, told Russian news agencies that the charges had been reclassified. But the investigators did not rule out more serious charges at a later date - in particular the use of violence against officials. The refusal of the detainees to give evidence also gives the authorities reason to consider other offences such as terrorism and espionage, Mr Markin said. Last week, 11 Nobel prize-winners wrote to Russian President Vladimir Putin, urging him to drop the charges of piracy. The presidential press secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said the president had no power to influence the courts. Mr Putin said last month that the activists had violated international law but it was "absolutely evident that they are, of course, not pirates". Vladimir Chuprov of Greenpeace Russia said that there was no case for either piracy or hooliganism charges. "The Arctic 30 are no more hooligans than they were pirates," he said in a statement. "This is still a wildly disproportionate charge that carries up to seven years in jail. It represents nothing less than an assault on the very principle of peaceful protest." Earlier Greenpeace Russia programme director Ivan Blokov told the Interfax news agency he was surprised the Russian government had refused to attend international court hearings in Germany over the detentions. The Netherlands took the case of the Dutch-flagged ship and its crew to the UN tribunal in Hamburg on Monday. The Russian foreign ministry released a statement pointing out that Moscow had opted out of UN Law of the Sea dispute procedures, which infringe upon sovereignty, in 1997. All 30 people who were on board the ship are in pre-trial detention in the northern port city of Murmansk until late November. They have complained of being held in harsh conditions, They were detained when Russian security sources stormed the ship five weeks ago following a protest against drilling for oil in the Arctic. Greenpeace denies any wrongdoing and is calling for the release of the detainees, who come from 18 countries, and the Arctic Sunrise. </body>

      <title>Wales' Harris wary of Italy threat</title>
      <description>Wales must be at their best to beat Italy in their opening game of the Rugby League World Cup, warns boss Iestyn Harris.</description>

      <body>Head coach Iestyn Harris says Wales will have to be at their best to beat Italy in their opening game of the Rugby League World Cup on Saturday. The Italians beat England 15-14 at the weekend and Harris said the result should serve as a warning to Wales for the game at the Millennium Stadium. He said: "We knew about the quality of the Italians and we knew they would be a formidable task in our first game. "I think the result they had against England confirmed that." The Group C/D match will be Wales' third game at stadium where they the lost to New Zealand in the 2000 World Cup and then again in 2002. "Italy are a very, very good team and they've got a lot of experience in there [and] they've got a lot of NRL experience in there," added Harris. "They are an extremely difficult team to play against and anything outside our best won't be good enough to win that game." England face Australia in Saturday's opening game of the tournament in Cardiff followed by Wales' clash with Italy. Harris is relishing a return to the venue and says a successful World Cup campaign could help the game's popularity in Wales. "To have a game at the Millennium Stadium for a Wales rugby league national side is certainly important to us," Harris said. "I'm sure the players who take the field will be immensely proud of the fact we're at the Millennium Stadium. "If we hit the ground running and get some momentum behind us then all of a sudden the Welsh public will start to get behind us. "That could kick off the sport [and] ultimately we've got that responsibility." </body>

      <title>'Devastating' college cuts warning</title>
      <description>Cuts to further education budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities.</description>

      <body>Cuts to further education (FE) budgets in Wales are "short-sighted" and could damage life-long learning, say teaching unions and charities. The Welsh government is proposing £44.9m of cuts in the FE sector next year and a further £42.5m the following year. The ATL teaching union said there would be a "devastating" impact. The Welsh government said it would work closely with colleges "to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning". Most of the proposed cuts will fall on post-19 further education, which is losing almost a quarter of a £160m budget. "We're talking about very positive things here, about courses which help with the difficult to reach, which help the Neets (not in education, employment or training), those who have been out of work for a long time, courses which help people to upskill and get better jobs," said Dr Phil Dixon from the ATL union. "And I think if those go, then a lot of people in the sector will be very demoralised." His concerns have been echoed by the University and College Union (UCU), which said colleges would struggle to deliver the level of services needed in Wales if the cuts went ahead. "The FE sector is a key player that should not be ignored," said a UCU spokesperson. "It provides a lifeline for many adults who want a second chance at education, enabling them to improve opportunities for themselves and therefore their children. "If reducing child poverty is a top priority for the Welsh government, the role that FE can play in this needs to be taken seriously and funded accordingly." Last year there were almost 250,000 learners in FE colleges in Wales, with three-quarters over the age of 19 and many studying part time. The colleges provide courses on a huge range of subjects including everything from basket weaving and brick laying to advanced manufacturing and engineering. Many of the courses are vocational but academic qualifications are also offered. The Welsh government's own analysis said the cuts would have a disproportionate impact on women, who are more likely to be adult learners, as well as those from an ethnic minority background. It also said it would make it more difficult for those who are out of work to re-train. The National Institute of Adult Continuing Education in Wales (NIACE) charity, said there were "wider benefits" in adult learning and now was not a time to cut the budget. "The effect of the cuts will be a reduction of the number of adult learners in Wales and NIACE Dysgu Cymru would advocate that at such a difficult time, we should be maintaining or even increasing funding for life-long learning for all sorts of reasons," said Essex Havard from NIACE. "There is a lot of research around the area of being an active learner and being a healthy adult, particularly in the area around mental health issues... adult learning can help people to get on with their lives after trauma, for example. "So these are the things we'd want to talk to the Welsh government about - about the wider benefits of adult learning, and of the wider impact of those cuts on the adult learning and life-long education budget." The Welsh government has protected provision aimed at 16-19 year olds, so post-19 further education will bear the brunt of the cuts. Around £37m is due to be cut from post-19 learning next year, a 23% reduction from its £160m budget. Responding to the criticisms about the cuts, the Welsh government said it had been "open about the stark reality" of the financial challenges being faced. "But as we work through these difficult times, it is ever more important that we focus not just on the resources that are available but how we use them and what we achieve," said a spokesperson. "We will work closely with the post-16 sector to evaluate available options and to minimise the impact of any reductions on learning. "This will be the case for any sector that may be impacted by reductions." </body>

      <title>Festival should 'continue to travel'</title>
      <description>The National Eisteddfod should continue to travel around Wales rather than moving to fixed bases, says a task force considering its future.</description>

      <body>The National Eisteddfod should continue to travel around Wales, says a task force that has been considering its future. Chaired by broadcaster Roy Noble, the group of 12 members opposed the festival establishing permanent bases. But their report said each eisteddfod should "experiment, better reflecting the area it is visiting". Eisteddfod chief executive Elfed Roberts welcomed the report and said it would be considered carefully. The National Eisteddfod is one of Europe's largest cultural and artistic festivals. Established by the Welsh government in 2012, the task-and-finish group looking at the event's future included Hay Festival director Peter Florence and Lord Dafydd Elis-Thomas AM. The biggest proposed change would have meant having a four-year cycle for the festival. In two of the years it would have been held in two different permanent bases, while during the other two years it would continue as now moving between north and south Wales to temporary homes. During this year's eisteddfod in Denbighshire, First Minister Carwyn Jones and Welsh Secretary David Jones both publicly supported the idea that it should remain a travelling festival. The report came to the same conclusion but recommended the appointment of a new artistic director "to attract visitors from all corners of the world". The eisteddfod receives about £500,000 from the Welsh government towards the £3.6m cost of staging the event. Mr Roberts said: "We welcome the publication of the group's report and will consider its content carefully. "This is an independent report on the eisteddfod, commissioned by the former minister for education and skills, and we look forward to receiving the government's response to its content and recommendations in due course. "This response and the report itself will be presented to the management board and the council of the eisteddfod, and following internal discussions we will publish our response to the report." </body>

      <title>Whistle-blowers 'put off' by policy</title>
      <description>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy is deterring people from raising concerns about poor care.</description>

      <body>Doctors believe the Welsh NHS's new whistle-blowing policy deters health staff from raising concerns about poor care, BBC Wales has learned. The All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy was published in July after Health Minister Mark Drakeford said he wanted people to feel able to voice concerns. But the British Medical Association called the policy complicated and could leave people confused or threatened. The Welsh government said it would review it before the end of March 2014. Mr Drakeford's decision to bring in the policy was part of a package of measures aimed at preventing any Welsh equivalent of the Stafford Hospital scandal in England, where hundreds of patients died as a result of neglect and abuse. A public inquiry led by Robert Francis QC accused health service managers of putting corporate self-interest ahead of the interests of patients. In July Mr Drakeford said he wanted a "culture of conversation" in the health service in Wales "where people feel able to voice concerns about care and know they are being heard". But Phil Banfield, chair of the the British Medical Association's Welsh council, said the All Wales Whistle-blowing Policy focused on process rather than encouraging openness and transparency. "That's a problem for us because it seems to threaten disciplinary action if the process is not followed," he told BBC Wales. "It is our experience in different organisations that people who raise concerns fear for their future in the organisation. That is getting worse not better. "The emphasis on following procedure and being disciplined if procedure is not followed really worries our members. "We've had various members raise concerns over patient safety where they say they have talked to the management structure and the concerns have not been addressed. "In fact they've been made to feel trivialised by raising the concerns." Cathy James, chief executive of the campaigning charity Public Concern at Work, said: "I think the main concern is it's not clear who the policy is aimed at. "The main thing with a whistle-blowing policy is to make it very, very clear that you want to hear from staff and that you will protect them when they raise that concern and that doesn't come across loud and clear in this policy. "I'm also worried about the duty to raise concerns that's imposed in the policy. "That causes more problems than it solves because you're putting people in a really difficult situation and that's not the way to encourage people to speak up." The Welsh government said it was committed to NHS Wales' continued development of "an open and transparent culture, where staff feel confident to raise concerns locally as they occur". It said the policy was developed in partnership with the NHS, trade unions and approved by the Welsh Partnership Forum. A spokesperson said: "All health boards were asked to adopt the policy, which encourages staff to report concerns and details how an individual can raise concerns via a number of avenues. "The Welsh government has previously instructed NHS organisations to ensure that whistle-blowing policies are in place to enable staff to raise concerns internally. "Harassment or victimisation of anyone raising a genuine concern will not be tolerated." A spokesman for Healthcare Inspectorate Wales welcomed the policy and said healthcare organisations need to do everything possible to listen to the concerns raised by their staff. "Organisations should develop a culture which supports staff and ensures that positive action is taken where concerns are raised," he added. </body>

      <body>Wales and British and Irish Lions scrum-half Mike Phillips's future at French club Bayonne is in doubt. Bayonne say no decision has been taken yet on Phillips' future following an alleged breach of discipline. The club have also condemned  media reports in France  claiming the 31-year-old player had been sacked. Phillips apologised in French to Bayonne fans "for this situation" on his Twitter account on Thursday evening. The player added: "I am behind the team wholeheartedly tomorrow night. Good luck." Bayonne host Montpellier in the Top 14 on Friday evening. Phillips appeared before the Bayonne board on Tuesday to answer allegations he turned up to a video analysis session under the influence of alcohol. Fellow players Dwayne Haare and Stephen Brett also had to answer allegations at that meeting, and were fined but not suspended. National coach Warren Gatland has said the 77-times capped player will not face punishment by Wales. Phillips was suspended by Bayonne last year, for off-field misconduct, and by Wales in July 2011 following an incident in Cardiff city centre when he was involved in a confrontation with a doorman. The former Scarlets, Cardiff Blues and Ospreys player joined Bayonne following the World Cup in the autumn of 2011. He was a key member of the Lions team that beat Australia 2-1 in the Test series last summer, setting up the opening try for Alex Corbisiero in the decisive third-Test victory in Sydney. Phillips also won Six Nations Grand Slams with Wales in 2008 and 2012. </body>

      <body>Welsh flyweight Andrew Selby had to settle for a bronze medal at the World Championships after losing his semi-final to Uzbekistan's Jasurbek Latipov. England middleweight Anthony Fowler was withdrawn from his semi-final in Almaty because of a hand injury. The home nations' tally of two bronze medals compares to three silver and one bronze in 2011. Jason Quigley became the first Irishman to reach a world final by defeating Russia's Artem Chebotarev. Donegal boxer Quigley will take on home favourite Zhanibek Alimkhanuly in the middleweight final on Saturday. Westmeath's Joe Ward boxes Cuba's Julio Cesar la Cruz for a place in the light-heavyweight final later on Friday. Double European champion Selby, 25, was left heartbroken at the World Championships two years ago when he lost his final by a point. And the Barry man, the top seed, was unlucky again in Almaty, having looked to have done enough to beat fourth seed Latipov. Unseeded Liverpudlian Fowler, 22, was to have fought home fighter Zhanibek Alimkhanuly in his semi-final. But he suffered a heavily bruised right hand in his quarter-final win over German Stefan Haertel. "I am absolutely gutted, I felt I could have gone all the way," said Fowler, who damaged the same hand in 2012. </body>

      <body>Swansea defender Neil Taylor insists the club are not yet thinking about the first Welsh Premier League derby against Cardiff City on 3 November. He said the players are concentrating on ending a busy nine days with a home win against West Ham United on Sunday. The Swans beat Sunderland 4-0 last weekend and drew 1-1 in Europe with Kuban Krasnodar on Thursday. "Cardiff will take care of itself. We need to get a result against West Ham," said the left-back. "This week is a big week for us and we need to get seven points from the week." On the Cardiff game he added: "I've got to be honest [now the Cardiff game has been mentioned] it's the only time I've remembered it. That's the truth!" With Ashley Williams again missing with an ankle injury and Ben Davies also sidelined for three to four weeks, Taylor captained the Swans against Russian outfit Kuban Krasnodar in the Europa Cup. Swansea went 1-0 up and looked set to win until Djibril Cisse's injury-time penalty denied Swansea all three points. "We just didn't get the result we wanted," admitted Taylor. "When the the clock hits 90 minutes and you are 1-0 up you should see the game out really." Taylor admitted that he is still not 100% match fit. He suffered multiple fractures and a dislocation to his ankle in September 2012 and then was out with a dead leg for four weeks. "I'm getting there. I don't feel as tired towards the end of 90 minutes as I did. The sharpness is still got to come," he said. "I've got to get into the gaffer's [manager Michael Laudrup] way of playing. Hopefully I can get up to speed quickly. "Between [Ben Davies and myself] we are going to have a lot of games to play this season. "These knocks are going to happen. Ash [Williams] has got his first injury since I have been at the club for four and a half years. Hopefully Ash is back soon." But Swansea boss Laudrup said he was unsure whether Williams would be fit for the West Ham game. "It's too early. I don't want to to say anything about Ashley. I don't want to push him," he added. </body>

      <title>Corden on singing like Paul Potts</title>
      <description>Acting, not singing, role of Britain's Got Talent winner</description>

      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the microphone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it, seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Twitter float could raise $1.4bn</title>
      <description>Twitter says it will sell 70 million shares priced between $17 (£10.50) and $20, valuing the microblogging site at as much as $11bn.</description>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <title>Mortgage competition picking up</title>
      <description>The Nationwide has cut some mortgage rates for those unable to raise a large deposit, but it remains undecided on whether to join the Help to Buy scheme.</description>

      <body>The Nationwide has cut some mortgage rates for those unable to raise a large deposit, but it remains undecided on whether to join the Help to Buy scheme. The UK's largest building society said fixed rate deals for those offering a deposit of 10% of a home's value would be cut by 0.3 percentage points. The aim is to challenge some lenders who have signed up to the government's extended Help to Buy scheme. But Nationwide itself remains uncommitted on whether to join. The government's initiative is designed to allow those who can make the repayments but can afford only small deposits to buy a home. The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit. Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales. Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan. The launch of the second stage prompted some lenders to bring out new mortgage products for first-time buyers. "The Help to Buy scheme has really prompted the lenders into offering better first-time buyer mortgages and lower deposit rates are still getting more competitively priced," said Aaron Strutt, of Trinity Financial mortgage brokers. "First-time buyers in general are accessing better mortgages and this is partly due to the increase in competition Help to Buy has generated." A host of big mortgage lenders have also said they would offer products when the scheme officially starts in January - but Nationwide is yet to be one of them. "No decision has been reached. Nationwide is continuing to support lending to those with smaller deposits and we are already very active in the high loan-to-value sector of the mortgage market," a Nationwide spokeswoman said. The building society's new rate for a two-year fixed rate deal for a buyer offering a 10% deposit is 3.99%, with a £900 fee, or a £400 fee for first-time buyers. A number of lenders offer mortgages at this loan-to-value level. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time with its franchise starting in February 2015. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC that the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "While they have done a good job, there is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 353-mile route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. Speaking to the Financial Times, shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said Labour's review of rail policy next year would consider the case for re-nationalisation among other options. "We want a model that is going to work. What is interesting is that we have foreign state-owned railways running our services and investing money back into their own networks. "If it works as a model for them, why can't it work as a model for the UK?" The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. "As with the Royal Mail, they are putting ideology before evidence in the desire to sell off yet another important state asset." </body>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

      <title>Gucci owner sees share price fall</title>

      <body>Shares in French luxury and retail firm Kering have dropped by 3.6% after its Gucci fashion brand posted its weakest quarterly sales growth for four years. Gucci's sales growth fell to 0.6% in the third quarter. Analysts had expected 1%. As a whole, Kering's luxury division posted a sales rise of 5.6%, as against expectations of up to 8%. Gucci makes up more than half of Kering, whose share price fell to 169 euros (£144) following the results. Citi analysts attributed Gucci's weaker performance to "self-inflicted disruption" as it attempted to take itself further upmarket. Jean-Marc Duplaix, finance director at Kering, said the weaker growth in Gucci sales was due to a temporary decline in demand for luxury products. He said that changes made by the company in order to restore control over the brand and increase exclusivity, by limiting distributors and volumes of product, were also behind the slowdown. Kering also owns Puma, Yves Saint Laurent and Alexander McQueen. Earlier this month, the world's biggest luxury goods group, LVMH, also reported slowing sales at its most important division, Louis Vuitton, which accounts for more than half of the group's operating profits. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has reported a 26% jump in profit in the third quarter driven by strong smartphone sales and a recovery in its memory chip business. It made a net profit of 8.24 trillion won ($7.6bn; £4.7bn) in the July-to-September quarter, up from 6.56tn won during the same period a year earlier. Operating profit rose to a record 10.2 trillion won during the quarter. The firm said sales of smartphones, a key driver of its growth, are expected to rise further in coming months. It said that sales "will gain momentum due to year-end promotions over the holiday season and an improved line-up of mass-market smartphones". Samsung has posted record operating profit in six of the past seven quarters, mostly due to the growth of its smartphone division. The firm has enjoyed success in both the top-end as well as lower end of the smartphone market, giving it an edge over rivals such as Apple which makes only top-end phones. Its growth in the sector has seen it become the world's biggest smartphone maker. However, there have been concerns over whether Samsung can continue to grow at such a strong pace, not least because of increased competition and saturation of some key markets. "Samsung has done well, having rapidly caught up with Apple in the smartphone market. But I'm concerned whether Samsung would be able to do better," said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. "Like Nokia, Samsung may hit a limit in increasing market share. Apple is also fighting back, signalling an uphill battle for Samsung." Analysts said that the company needed to come up with more innovative products to help sustain its growth rate. For its part, Samsung has been taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, it launched a smartphone with a curved display screen, beating its rival LG by at least a few months to offer a handset featuring flexible-screen tech. In September, it unveiled a smartwatch with a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps. Again, it edged firms such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to unveil such a device. Samsung's latest earnings were also boosted by its semiconductor business, which saw profit more than double to 2.1tn won, the highest in three years. Revenues in the division rose 12% over the previous quarter to 9.74tn won. The firm saw its bottom line buoyed by stronger chip prices after a fire at a plant owned by rival SK Hynix caused tightened supply in the market. Samsung supplies chips to other smartphone-makers, including its biggest competitor Apple, and expects demand to pick up as the year draws to a close. However, its consumer electronics division, which includes TV manufacturing, saw a decline in profit due to a drop in demand in China and Europe. But Samsung said that it expects the unit to bounce back in the current quarter, not least due to holiday season shopping during the end of the year. </body>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <title>Salmond 'certain' on Ineos deal</title>
      <description>First Minister Alex Salmond says he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved.</description>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has said he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved. Staff are waiting to hear if owner Ineos will grant a reprieve to the closure-threatened operation. About 800 jobs are under threat - and the company has already laid off about 2,000 contractors since it shut down the complex. Ineos will update the staff on its plans at a meeting at 11:00. Speaking on the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I would now be very hopeful indeed that there will be a change in position from Ineos and I'm absolutely certain there's a future for chemicals in Grangemouth. "I believe there will be a change in position today and that will be a favourable change in position. "My reason for saying that is that everybody has been going that extra mile I called for. "Given that only 48 hours ago we were looking at a major industrial catastrophe in Scotland, I think we're in a much better position this Friday morning." Mr Salmond said the trade unions had offered that there would be no industrial action for three years. "That's an indication that however we got to this impasse two days ago, there has now been substantial movement of people anxious to save their jobs, their livelihoods and their plants," he told the programme. Political leaders had already expressed optimism after the union accepted a survival plan put forward by Ineos. The BBC understands that an agreement was being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. On Thursday, Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney and the Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael held talks with unions and management at the site. Afterwards they said they were hopeful. However, Ineos is yet to confirm whether it will reverse its decision to close the petrochemical plant at the complex. An internal investigation by Ineos into the union convenor, Stephen Deans, is also due to be published later. It was the firm's treatment of Mr Deans that first ignited the breakdown in industrial relations - before it became a battle for the survival of Scotland's largest industrial site. The dispute at the site escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. The proposals included ending their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. </body>

      <body>Oxfam is set to cut 125 posts in the UK and close several of its regional offices to make it more "efficient", the charity has said. Its headquarters in Oxford will be most affected, with 110 jobs being axed. The charity is also expected to concentrate its work on fewer countries. Mark Goldring, Oxfam CEO, said: "It is imperative that we have an Oxfam which lives within its means and is relevant to 21st century needs." Several departments will be reduced, including human resources, finance, business support, and campaigns and policy. The changes reflect a shift in the organisation's priorities, it said. They would also "balance its budget and, in due course, provide additional funds to invest in programmes". Resources are to be focused on poorer countries, including promoting poor women's rights. Mr Goldring said: "Advances in technology mean we no longer need as much support in head office. "Instead, our resources will be focused in the regions where we carry out the majority of our work. "This will mean we can deliver the most effective and efficient support to the millions of people who go to sleep hungry each night." Jane Cotton, Oxfam's human resources director, said: "This is the start of a consultation process with staff. "We will make every effort to keep the number of redundancies to a minimum and where possible we will redeploy people and help colleagues find work elsewhere if this is not practical." Further changes will be made to Oxfam's international programme, starting in 2015. Its income fell £17.6m to £367.9m in the year to 31 March, with its two main sources of money, shops and fundraising, down on the previous year. The charity's annual report showed its shops' net income fell 9.9% to £20.1m, while fundraising fell 5.6% to £267.8m. It blamed the fall on tough economic times, and said many shops had reported a decline in donations. Problems in Syria, Yemen and West Africa had also stretched its resources, Mr Goldring said. Oxfam GB employs 5,300 people across the world and has more than 22,000 volunteers. </body>

      <body>Truckmaker Volvo is cutting 2,000 jobs after investments in new models and a rising Swedish kronor held back third-quarter profits. Sweden's largest private sector employer said earnings fell to 2.50bn kronor ($393m; £242m) from 3.48bn kronor a year-ago. Volvo is launching a new range of trucks ahead of emissions rule changes. "The changeover to the new products will take another couple of quarters," chief executive Olof Persson said. Volvo, which makes trucks under the Renault, Mack and UD brands, said third-quarter sales fell to 64.9bn kronor, down 5% on the same quarter last year. European demand for commercial vehicles has been held back by an 18-month recession that ended in the second quarter of this year. Sales in the heavy-truck segment in Europe fell 8.1% in the eight months to the end of August, according to industry data. Mr Persson said in a statement: "The product renewal is the largest in the history of the Volvo Group, and it means that we are going to enter 2014 with a highly competitive product range." Shares in Volvo, which employs about 120,000 people, were 7% down in early morning trading. </body>

      <body>Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, saw its losses narrow in the third quarter as its sales grew more than expected. It reported a net loss of $41m (£25m) for the July-September period. That is down from $274m a year earlier. The firm said that its sales surged 24% from a year ago to $17.1bn. The firm forecast its sales would grow further in the current quarter. That saw its shares rise by as much as 9.6% in after-hours trading in New York. RJ Jottovy, an analyst with Morningstar, said that "it looks like the revenue momentum will continue into the fourth quarter" despite the macro business environment being tough. Amazon said it expects fourth-quarter sales of $23.5bn to $26.5bn. Analysts had forecast revenue of $25.9bn. This is the third quarter in a row that Amazon has posted a net loss. However, the firm has been taking steps to try to turn around its fortunes. This includes expanding its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets and boosting its delivery network and cloud-computing services. The company has also been building more warehouses to reduce shipping costs and is adding robots to increase its efficiency in delivering orders. Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement that ''it's been a busy few months" for the company. At the same time some of the services being offered by the firm have also helped to attract consumers. Mr Bezos added that one Amazon service called Prime had signed up "millions" of new members. The service offers free two-day shipping for eligible purchases. Members also get access to Amazon Instant Video and have the ability to borrow books from other Kindle owners. </body>

      <body>Microsoft reported better than expected earnings of $5.2bn (£3.2bn). Profits at the technology giant were up 17% from the same period last year. "Our devices and services transformation is progressing," said boss Steve Ballmer in a statement. He added that Microsoft is launching a "wide range" of new products in the coming quarter. The report shed no light on who is to replace Mr Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within the next year. The company has released several new products this quarter, including an update to Windows 8, and recently bought the mobile phone unit of struggling Finnish giant Nokia. Shares rose 6% in after hours trading on the strong results. For the first time, Microsoft also announced sales of its tablet computer, Surface. It said revenues from Surface "grew to $400 million with sequential growth in revenue and units sold over the prior quarter". Last quarter, the company was forced to take an embarrassing write down of $900m after sluggish sales. The computer, well-liked by reviewers, marked Microsoft's first foray into hardware manufacturing. However consumers, many of whom expressed displeasure at Microsoft's update to its popular operating system Windows, did not bite. The company still did not provide sales figures of the device. Investors hoping for any information about who will replace Mr Ballmer in the new year were disappointed. Earlier today, on a conference call to discuss earnings, Ford boss Alan Mullaly declined to comment on rumours that he was being considered for the top job. Other contenders include Stephen Elop, the former head of Nokia, who resigned as boss after Microsoft announced it would purchase the Nokia's mobile phone unit for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) in September. Mr Elop is now head of Devices and Services at Nokia, although he is expected to transfer to Microsoft - where he was once a top manager - once the deal is completed. Mr Ballmer has been at the helm of Microsoft since 2000, and has been at the company since 1980. </body>

      <body>The Bank of England intends to boost the availability of finance for banks, a move which could help them lend to consumers. Describing the bank as "open for business", he said it would offer money for longer periods and widen the range of assets accepted as collateral. He justified the move by saying that banks were healthier and had to meet tougher standards. He also said there were reasons to believe the recovery was sustainable. "One of the reasons to think there could be some sustainability, some traction in the recovery is that the core of the financial system has gotten a lot better," he said. "I won't say it's fully healed, but it's gotten a lot better and the rebuilding of [bank] capital is a big element of that." He accepted that the reputation of the banking system had been damaged over the last few years. He said that when he visited the UK as governor of the Bank of Canada during the crisis, he was struck how different the attitude was towards the banking sector. He said that "loathing" of the banking sector had replaced confidence. Mr Carney was speaking at a gathering marking the 125th anniversary of the Financial Times newspaper. He said he hoped that banks would take advantage of the new opportunities to borrow from the Bank of England, as those facilities were little used at the moment. The idea is to smooth bank finances and avoid a credit crunch, in which banks are unwilling to loan money to consumers or business. </body>

      <title>Greenland allows huge iron ore mine</title>
      <description>Greenland gives UK-based London Mining a 30-year licence to build and operate an iron ore mine, employing up to 3,000 mainly Chinese workers.</description>

      <body>Greenland has awarded UK-based company London Mining a 30-year licence to build and run a giant iron ore mine. Greenland's industry minister called it the largest commercial project in the autonomous Danish territory's history. London Mining is expected to seek investment partners for the multi-billion dollar project. Some opponents say the open-cast mine will cause environmental damage; others are concerned about plans to bring in up to 3,000 mainly Chinese workers. The iron ore deposit is located 150km (about 90 miles) from Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. In a statement on its website, London Mining said the mine was expected to produce 15m tonnes a year of "very high quality iron ore concentrate to the global steel industry". It said the ore concentrate could be shipped year round from a dedicated deep water port. The Greenland government hopes the mine will boost the economy, which is largely dependent on fishing and subsidies from Denmark. "This is indeed a historic moment for Greenland," said Industry and Minerals Minister Jens-Erik Kirkegaard. He said "the largest commercial project to date in Greenland" would boost employment and state revenues - in line with a pledge made by the governing Social Democrats to draw foreign companies to help tap Greenland's resources. The project, known as Isua, is expected to bring in 3,000 workers to Greenland, which has a population of about 56,000, to help build and operate the mine and related infrastructure. London Mining, in a report from June 2010, said it had "identified significant economies of scale, and the involvement of Chinese construction groups is anticipated to deliver significant cost savings". Environmentalists say they want reassurances that the exploitation of the deposits will not come at the cost of extensive environmental damage. "I really hope that the Greenland government has sold itself at a high price, so that London Mining lives up to far stricter requirements than they originally would have done," said Gitte Seeberg, the secretary general of WWF Denmark. She said the Greenland government should insist that the mine be powered by hydroelectric power rather than diesel, and that there should be safeguards to deal with problems such as the dramatic increase in traffic. </body>

      <body>Actor Robert De Niro is among the investors in a new property complex in the Chinese city of Shanghai, to include an arts centre, a boutique hotel, a cinema and global retailers. Due to open in 2016, Project 179 will be a 76,500-sq-m (850,000-sq-ft) complex on Shanghai's waterfront. De Niro signed a deal with the property's owner, the Shanghai Bund Investment group, as part of a US-Chinese business partnership. The design will reflect 1920s Shanghai. De Niro said: "By ensuring a design that reflects the vibrant history of Shanghai, Project 179 can serve as a jewel in its crown: ushering in a bright future while paying homage to its rich and storied past." The star of films including Goodfellas and Taxi Driver said he was looking forward to establishing the Bund district, on Shanghai's waterfront, as "one of the premier visitor destinations across the globe". The project will restore four vacant buildings and build a fifth, and is named after the municipally-designated blocks of land it is built on. </body>

      <body>Supermarket chain Sainsbury's has apologised after a worker told a new mother she "shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young". Sabina Latto said she was approached by the female employee in a store in Hedge End, Hampshire, with questions about her six-week-old son, Myles. But the conversation turned and she was later asked: "Where's the father?" She complained while in the store and the worker apologised. Sainsbury's said it was investigating. Mrs Latto said it was one of the few times she had taken Myles out of the house since he was born. "I was approached by a member of staff, and when you have a new baby lots of people approach you and usually it's very kind things like 'oh isn't he gorgeous', and initially that's how the conversation started," she told BBC News. "Unfortunately it took a very sudden turn when she decided to tell me that, basically, I shouldn't be out of the house with a baby this young. "She asked me what I was thinking 'bringing my son to a place like this'. "It left me completely shocked, I was almost speechless." The new mother said other shoppers stepped in to defend her but the remarks continued during the incident on Wednesday. "Then she went on to ask me where my son's father was," Mrs Latto added. "[It] made it seem like I wasn't looking after him properly and that I was neglecting him when all I was doing was having a look round the shops." She made a complaint and was taken for a chat in the store's cafe where the employee later made an apology. In a statement, Sainsbury's said: "We are deeply concerned by this incident and apologise unreservedly to Mrs Latto for the distress this has caused her. "We are investigating what happened and the store manager would like to meet Mrs Latto to apologise in person." </body>

      <title>New fears over university pensions</title>
      <description>A massive shortfall in a pensions scheme used by UK university staff is even worse than thought, analysis for BBC Newsnight suggests.</description>

      <body>A massive shortfall in a pensions scheme used by UK university staff is even worse than thought, analysis for the BBC's Newsnight has suggested. In its status report this month the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) put its fund deficit at £7.9bn. But the analysis methods that private companies use put it at £10.5bn. There are concerns that such a significant hole in what is the biggest pension fund in the country could lead to a rise in tuition fees for students. The Universities Superannuation Scheme, with 303,000 members, has assets of £37.9bn - more than three times what taxpayers spend every year on higher education. By its own official estimate to members this month, that is £7.9bn short of what it needs to pay pensions. Those numbers are disputed by the fund's critics who say that working it out on the formula private companies use - known as FRS17 - would put it at £2.6bn higher. Analysis for Newsnight by pensions consultant John Ralfe, former finance director of Boots, showed that to make good that deficit over 20 years would require a nearly doubling of contributions to £1.8bn. That equates to a rise in tuition fees of up to £1,000 a year. Mr Ralfe said: "There is a whole degree of denial. USS is in denial about its real financial situation. Universities are in denial. "We have seen private member schemes closing to new members and existing members wholesale over the last few years. "There will be repercussions for the university sector. All we're doing is bequeathing a very real problem to our children." Higher Education Minister David Willetts told Newsnight it would be wrong to pass on the cost of higher pensions to students. "Universities are independent autonomous bodies and they know one of their financial responsibilities is to stand behind their pensions and tackle their deficits," he said. "It would be wrong to expect students to bail out pension deficits to support pension schemes that are far more generous than students are likely to enjoy when they're older." Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the umbrella body Universities UK, said there was no question that tuition fees would be used to address the pension fund shortfall. "Employers have already taken significant steps to address the fund deficit and will continue to work on long term solutions to ensure that USS remains sustainable and affordable. "The range of challenges facing the fund are not exclusive to USS and impact on all pension schemes. "There is no suggestion that tuition fees will be increased to plug the USS funding shortfalls. This will not feature in any of the considered options to deal with this deficit." Prof Craig Calhoun, director of the London School of Economics, said the size of the scheme's black hole concerned him. "It's very worrying now and it looks even more worrying for the future," he said. "It would be an added cost that we would have to cover either from tuition fees or some other source, either philanthropy or earnings from consulting or other enterprises." Bill Galvin, chief executive of USS, told the Newsnight programme that higher contributions or cuts to benefits had to be considered. He said: "It's been done in 2008. It's been done in 2011. We're looking at it again now." The likelihood of higher tuition fees runs alongside the prospect of university staff having to pay more for their pensions. Under a landmark agreement with universities, university staff have to share any large increases in costs with their employers. They are already in militant mood, with strikes planned next week over pay. </body>

In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>Scottish Power raises prices by 8.6%</title>
      <description>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% on dual-fuel energy bills in the same week as being hit by a penalty for its sales tactics.</description>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <body>The pace of growth among businesses in the eurozone eased in October as the service sector slowed, a survey has indicated. The preliminary Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) from research firm Markit fell to 51.5 from 52.2 in September. However, a reading above 50 still implies expansion, and activity has now grown for four months in a row. Markit said expansion was "broad-based" across the eurozone, although growth slowed in both Germany and France. Germany - which has been the main economic powerhouse for the eurozone in recent years - saw growth slow to a three-month low. Markit also noted that the eurozone's jobs market remained weak. Employment fell for the 22nd month in a row, with the rate of job losses picking up from September. "The survey data have been running in positive territory for four consecutive months now and indicate that the eurozone economy expanded at a quarterly rate of 0.2% at the start of the fourth quarter, suggesting an ongoing, albeit sluggish, recovery," said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit. Spain's economy - which was one of the hardest hit by the credit crunch and subsequent economic downturn - has shown signs this week that it is slowly starting to recover. Official figures show the country's unemployment rate - which is one of the highest in Europe - fell slightly in the third quarter of this year, to 26% from 26.3% in the previous quarter. On Wednesday, the Bank of Spain said the country's economy had emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years. The bank estimated that Spain's economy grew by 0.1% between July and September. The eurozone emerged from recession in the second quarter of this year when it grew by 0.3% following a record 18 months of economic contraction. However, earlier this month, European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi said the recovery in the bloc remained "weak, fragile, uneven". He said further support for the banking sector could not be ruled out, and that the ECB was "ready to consider all available instruments" to maintain financial stability and ensure that recovery in the eurozone took hold. There has been speculation that the ECB might offer another round of cheap, long-term loans to banks to keep the cost of credit down. </body>

      <title>Detroit's bankruptcy case in court</title>
      <description>Lawyers begin presenting their arguments over whether Detroit should be allowed bankruptcy protection from its creditors.</description>

      <body>A federal judge is hearing arguments over whether Detroit city should be granted protection from its creditors. In opening remarks, Bruce Bennett, the lead attorney for Detroit, said there was a "mountain of evidence showing the insolvency of the city". But representatives for the city's unions and pension funds disagree and say the city is solvent. With $18bn (£11bn) of liabilities, Detroit's case is the biggest municipal bankruptcy filing in US history. The case to determine whether or not Detroit can continue with its bankruptcy filing is expected to last anywhere from five to 10 days. In opening testimony, Jennifer Green, a lawyer for the Detroit pension fund boards, argued that the city and the state of Michigan had always planned to file for bankruptcy - despite earlier assurances in 2013 that newly appointed emergency manager Kevyn Orr would be evaluating all options. As part of the bankruptcy hearing, the unions and pension funds are trying to prove that the city did not negotiate with them "in good faith". If Steven Rhodes, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, agrees with them, the city would have to go back to the drawing board. Protesters outside the court in particular singled out Mr Orr, chanting, "Down with Orr" and "Orr no more". The appointment of Mr Orr, who is scheduled to testify on Monday, was controversial as it was done without voter support. Unions and pension funds won a small victory when it was ruled that Michigan governor Rick Snyder would have to testify on Friday. Furthermore, lawyers for the city admitted that plans to sell some works from the Detroit Institute of Arts might have to be shelved unless there is a leadership change at the museum. Current director Graham Beal has said the plan is "abhorrent" and has vowed to fight any efforts to sell the museum's artworks, which include major works by Henri Matisse and Vincent van Gogh. However, many experts still believe that the judge will eventually rule in Detroit's favour. City managers say bankruptcy is the only way to manage Detroit's debts and liabilities. Half of the city's liabilities result from payments to retired staff, which includes healthcare and pension obligations. In May, Mr Orr presented a report on Detroit's financial situation. It said Detroit's expenditures had exceeded revenues by an average of $100m each year from 2008 to 2012. Detroit has seen a dramatic decline in economic activity and population, as the big car makers - once the city's main source of employment - shifted production to cheaper locations in the US and overseas. The city is now home to about 700,000 residents, down from the peak of 1.8 million in 1950. There are almost 150,000 vacant and abandoned plots in the city according to the Detroit Future City report. </body>

      <title>Bank says Spain out of recession</title>
      <description>Spain's economy has emerged from recession, according to the country's central bank, after growing by 0.1% in the July-to-September quarter.</description>

      <body>Spain's economy has emerged from recession after growing for the first time in more than two years, according to estimates from the Bank of Spain. Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by 0.1% between July and September, the bank said. However, GDP was still 1.2% lower in the quarter compared with the same period last year. Spain's economy has been struggling ever since the credit crisis struck in 2008. The bank's figures are an estimate, and the country's National Statistics agency INE is due to release preliminary third quarter GDP data on 30 October. The Bank of Spain said the country's economy had been helped by stronger exports in the past quarter. "The slight recovery in activity in the third quarter after the fall a quarter earlier is due to... a more favourable contribution from the external sector," it said in its monthly bulletin. Spain has been one of the countries worst hit by the fallout from the credit crisis. The crisis burst the country's housing bubble, and its banks needed government bailouts to survive after being left holding hundreds of billions of euros in bad debts. Its unemployment rate of more than 26% is one of the highest in Europe. Government austerity measures aimed at cutting Spain's large deficit prompted huge protests across the country last year. However, the government recently claimed that the end of the recession was near, saying reforms and austerity measures were paying off. Ignacio del Torre, economist at financial advisory firm Arcano, said: "After recently implemented reforms, Spain has become an export powerhouse. "It will fully leave the recession behind in 2014 with private investment and consumption growth turning positive after three years of decline and credit levels stabilising," he added. </body>

      <title>Ethiopia's leather industry booming</title>
      <description>Ethiopia's leather industry is enjoying a big rise in exports, and one British company is at the centre of things, reports James Jeffrey in Addis Ababa.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24610075</url>
      <date>1382570080</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70651000/jpg/_70651844_sewing1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Amid the rhythmic clicking of rows and rows of sewing machines, hundreds of workers are busy creating a range of leather gloves, bags and jackets. "I can tell when employees' skills have improved by the noises of the machines speeding up," says Tsedenia Mekbib, a general manager. We are at a busy factory on the outskirts of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. It is one of three such facilities in the city owned by UK leather goods company Pittards, which has a long history of operating in the country. While an increasing number of Western firms of all sizes are now looking at doing business in Africa, Pittards has had a 90-year head start. The company, which is based in Yeovil, Somerset, in the south-west of England, has been trading in Ethiopia since the 1920s. And it is all down to a celebrated type of sheep - the Ethiopian hair sheep. This breed, which does not grow a thick coat of wool, also has much thinner skin than its European brethren, making it ideal for delicate leather apparel such as ladies' gloves. Pittards now has ambitious plans to grow its Ethiopian operations, which help contribute towards the firm's £39m ($60m) annual revenues. At present its Addis Ababa-based factories and tannery to the south of the city employ about 1,200 locals, a number expected to grow to about 5,000 within five years. A fourth factory has already been built, and is waiting to be occupied. On the current production floors, an element of handwork is also included in the manufacturing process, which each month produces 100,000 work gloves and 5,000 dress gloves. Pittards' Ethiopian factories also produce two million sq feet (186,000 sq m) of quality leather for export to be made into garments ranging from specialist golf gloves to couture handbags. "Ethiopia will grow in importance to Pittards and the global leather industry [in general]," says the company's chief executive Reg Hankey. Ethiopia's attractions for Pittards, and other Western firms, include the country's large pool of relatively low-cost labour. It also has duty-free status for most manufactured products for export to Europe, the US and other countries. Despite Ethiopia having the largest flock of hair sheep in the world - more than 26 million - it is not the largest supplier of skins. Its flock's reproductive rate of about 37% trails New Zealand's 180% and means Ethiopia has only some 9.5 million sheepskins available annually compared with New Zealand's total of about 30 million. Better animal husbandry should increase Ethiopia's supply. Pittards is already involved in environmental programmes to improve the quality of local skins through improved husbandry and treatment against parasites. Another benefit could be improved meat yields, a not insignificant detail while Ethiopia remains a developing country. Regarding the wider issues of doing business in Ethiopia, Mr Hankey says the country faces the same challenges as other developing nations, encompassing difficulties related to bureaucracy, customs and banking. Yet, he adds, while more has to be done, the situation is greatly improved. "Ethiopia has come a very long way over the last 23 years since I first visited, and the last decade in particular has witnessed massive positive changes," Mr Hankey says. "Ethiopia has worked very hard to establish itself as a preferred country for economic development within Africa." Ethiopia's government now wants to grow its leather industry's annual exports to $500m by the completion of its five-year growth and transformation plan at the end of 2015. Leather exports stood at $123m last year. Within Pittards, the British management is happy to be playing a part in Ethiopia reaching its ambitious goal. "We have put down roots," Mr Hankey says. "This changes relationships and thinking - we see things from the inside and the outside, giving us a unique position for further development." Busy at work in the Pittards factory is 20-year-old Embret Beshada. Her job is to sew two glove-shaped panels together while incorporating material to create a thumb casing. She says she found the work easy when she started just over a year ago, despite having to learn many new skills, and was producing gloves within two months. "Being able to support myself excites me the most," she says. Sitting at sewing machines nearby are some of her friends. About 80% of the factory workforce is female, while at the tannery about 80% of the workforce is male. "We are seeing people get more jobs, and people's lifestyles changing, which gives us hope for the future," Ms Beshada adds. </body>

      <title>The tech boss who says it is all about the staff</title>
      <description>A profile of Robert Stanzione, the boss of technology firm Arris, which has expanded greatly under his stewardship.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24517646</url>

      <body>Robert Stanzione is the boss of one of the largest companies you have probably never heard of. Mr Stanzione is chief executive of fast-growing US technology group Arris. The company makes set-top boxes, and other pieces of hardware and software for digital television and broadband services. Arris made the business headlines at the end of last year when it agreed a $2.35bn (£1.5bn) deal to buy the Motorola Home set-top box business from Google. The internet giant had put Motorola Home up for sale after it had bought parent group Motorola Mobility, the main part of which was Motorola's mobile phone business. Arris' purchase of Motorola Home was completed in the spring of this year, and saw the Georgia-based company - in terms of turnover - triple in size overnight. It means that in the US, the Arris name will increasingly be seen on set-top boxes as the Motorola brand is retired. Whereas in the UK, Arris' technology is already used by the likes of BT and Virgin Media. Mr Stanzione said the Motorola Home deal highlighted Arris' continuing ambition. "As soon as we heard rumours that it was going to be up for sale, we began to look at where it would take us, it will fuel our continued growth as a company," says Mr Stanzione. "We have tripled the size of the company over the past decade, and this deal sees us grow by that amount again. It is all credit to the team around me." Chief executive of Arris since it was founded in 1995, Mr Stanzione, 65, says he has a very simple but effective strategy for leadership - bringing in the best people to work with him. "Find the right people, keep them, and motivate them," he says. "Let them know how important they are, and give them clear responsibility. I think that's the key to success." Mr Stanzione says he wanted to make a difference in life. "I have always had this curiosity, always had the desire to be around smart people, and participate in a way that would change things," he says. "I am very excited by helping to create new solutions to old problems, being more efficient, more effective." Mr Stanzione adds that while he has always been persistent in his career, he is happy to admit to having had some good fortune along the way. "I have had an element of luck, it would be remiss of me not to say that. Sometimes being in the right place at the right time matters." With a degree in mechanical engineering from Clemson University in South Carolina, and a masters in industrial engineering from North Carolina State University, before joining Arris, Mr Stanzione held a range of engineering and management positions at US telecoms group ATandT. His advice to young people who aspire to go on and lead a large company is to follow his example and get some good qualifications. "First of all, get as much education as you can," he says. "Then get involved in something you enjoy and stick with it. "But success is a very personal thing. For some, ambition is to rise to the top of an organisation - but for others it is earning a lot of money, or something else. "I'd say your primary goal should be to be involved in something meaningful that you also enjoy." With Arris enjoying $1.3bn (£805m) of revenues last year, it was certainly already successful before the Motorola Home takeover. The deal itself saw Arris pay Google $2.2bn in cash, which it funded though debt financing, and the sale of a 7.7% share in its business-to-cable TV firm Comcast. Arris also gave Google 10.6 million of its shares, which gives Google the same minority stake in Arris as Comcast. Mr Stanzione said Arris and its 6,500 employees were now continuing with its aim to cement its position as the world's best provider of the technology behind on-demand TV content. Yet with rivals from around the globe, and especially China, he says he is never complacent. "I'm paranoid every day," he says. "I'm always looking over my shoulder at the competitors, be they other strong American companies, or other rivals from Asia." Mr Stanzione adds that the best business advice he ever received was "keep the organisation lean", and use "small empowered teams". Now the age of a pensioner and married to wife Kaye for almost 45 years, Mr Stanzione says that while he loves spending time with his 10 grandchildren, he has no plans to retire. "To me if you enjoy your work, and I certainly do, then that is you relaxing," he says. "If someone can look at you and not be able to tell if you are working or playing, that is a pretty good place to be." </body>

      <title>How big retailers learned to love fashion</title>
      <description>Big retailers are rethinking the way they sell clothing and going for a high fashion rather than a low price approach.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24516542</url>

      <body>When Sir Stuart Rose says something on retail, it's worth listening. With a 40-year track record in the industry, the former chief executive and chairman of Marks and Spencer is famed for turning around struggling retailers. Now an independent, non-executive director at South Africa's Woolworths Holdings, a chain of shops selling fashion, food, beauty and home ware, he says retail has changed. "Where the customer used to be king before, the customer is now the master of the universe: and they want what they want, how they want it, when they want it." For Woolworths, this shift has been felt most keenly in clothing - an area that along with beauty and home ware makes up 38% of its business in South Africa. In response, over the past two to three years it has made a conscious effort to make its clothing more fashionable, which crucially has involved getting it from the design stage to the shop floor much more quickly. "Previously it was 11-months-plus for all of our clothing products to the point now where we can turn [an item] around in 90 days," says Ian Moir, chief executive of Woolworths (which has no connection with the former British High Street chain of the same name). The strategy appears to be working. The company's most recent results for the year to the end of June saw clothing sales grow by 13.7%. "If we don't give the customer the trend, the colour, the fashion they're looking for, at the end of the day they're going to go somewhere else," says Mr Moir. Neil Saunders, managing director at retail consultancy Conlumino, says the changes at Woolworths reflect a "sea change" in how supermarket groups sell clothing. "They have become more like clothing retailers. Five years ago they used to merchandise it in the same way as, for example, baked beans. They piled it high and sold it cheap. But now they have become lifestyle rather than commodity-led." Mr Saunders says the 2008 financial crisis and resulting recession is a key reason behind this change in approach, with a trend for people to choose quality items that they expect to last. "Before the recession people bought lots of stuff... they even bought stuff they didn't wear. There was a disposable element because clothing was cheap and people felt affluent. "People are more frugal now. They buy less stuff and follow the ethos of, 'If you buy it right you buy it once.'" Mr Saunders says, however, that low prices can still lure in customers if they are combined with fashion, citing Primark as an example. "It's on trend and that makes people very interested. But if a retailer just chases value then they struggle," he adds. UK supermarket group Sainsbury's founded its clothing range Tu almost a decade ago. James Brown, clothing business director at Sainsbury's, says when Tu began it was focused on core products such as leggings, jogging bottoms and T-shirts, with ranges changed every 12 weeks or longer. But in the past two years it has become more trend-led. "Since our recent rebrand the new Tu range is refreshed every six weeks to keep up with the latest fashions, and offer new products to our customer," says Mr Brown. "Over the last nine years we have learnt more about our broad customer base and have adapted the range to offer more High Street-style garments at supermarket prices to meet customer demand," he adds. The approach seems to be working - at its recent trading update for the 16 weeks to 28 September it said its general merchandise and clothing business grew at more than twice the rate of its food business. Mr Brown says new items are planned up to seven months in advance, but that it can react quickly to last-minute trends by turning around a style in just eight weeks, assuming it can get the necessary fabric and has the production capacity. In contrast, for High Street chain Zara, production capacity is rarely an issue because unusually its owner Inditex has its own factories. These manufacture what it says is a "significant share" of its clothing for its eight brands, which include upmarket Massimo Dutti and teen label Bershka, but primarily the most fashionable garments. For those items the clothes can be produced and in store in a rapid two to three weeks. "Customer expectations are higher than ever so our capability to adapt and react to their demands is one of our key strengths," says an Inditex source. For Ian Moir, this is the key to Woolworths' future. "The importance of fashion is becoming greater and greater and customer awareness is getting better and better. "They're very fashion aware and they want it now. That's the way the world is going, it's the way it's changing and it's the way we've got to change as a business."

      <body>French clubs will go on strike in November in protest at plans to impose higher taxes on players' wages. The government wants a 75% 'super tax' on those earning an annual salary of more than 1m euros (£850,000) . Jean-Pierre Louvel, president of professional clubs' union UCPF, said: "There will be a weekend without a game at the end of the month (November)." The strike will affect matches in Ligue 1 and 2 - the top two divisions - from 29 November to 2 December. Under the proposal, companies, rather than individuals, would be liable to pay the 75% tax rate for the part of employees' annual salaries that exceed 1million euros. Paris St-Germain, who are backed by Qatar investors, will be the hardest hit by the tax. Monaco, who are funded by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, will be exempt as they do not fall under French tax laws. The concern among clubs is that the 'super tax' will deter footballers from playing for sides in France. The issue will be debated in parliament, and French president Francois Hollande will meet representatives of the French clubs next week to discuss the issue. Initial plans were for individuals earning more than 1million euros to pay the 75% rate, but the government changed the proposals after protests by top French executives and actors such as Gerard Depardieu. Ligue 1 clubs registered a loss of 108 million euros (£92m) at the end of the 2011-12 season with the accumulated loss over the last three seasons amounting to 303m euros (£259m). Louvel added: "There is already a deficit in our sector and now they impose a new tax. Football has a role in society and that will be affected as a consequence of these new measures. "This unprecedented day is an opportunity for the silent majority of French football to express their opposition." </body>

      <body>The Indian Grand Prix will go ahead as scheduled this weekend after a hearing into alleged tax irregularities was delayed until next week. Campaigner Amit Kumar had accused race promoters of not paying entertainment taxes for the 2012 event and demanded the cancellation of Sunday's race. But a court official said: "The case will now be heard next week." The Indian Grand Prix has been dropped from next year's calendar but promoters are optimistic of a return in 2015. Red Bull's Sebastian Vettel, who leads Ferrari rival Fernando Alonso by 90 points with 100 still available, is expected to clinch his fourth world crown this Sunday. The German, who has led every racing lap at the Indian Grand Prix since its debut in 2011, will claim the title if he ends up fifth or higher, regardless of where Alonso finishes. The long-term future of the Indian Grand Prix is uncertain after F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone removed the race from the 2014 calendar. Organisers are trying to find a new date for its return in 2015, with Ecclestone keen for the race to take place in the early part of the season, rather than its current October date. </body>

      <title>'High demand' for Games tickets sale</title>
      <description>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow sees "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking.</description>

      <body>A second sale of tickets for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow has seen "high demand" with delays of more than 60 minutes for online booking. People who did not manage to get any tickets during the first sale can make purchases on Monday and Tuesday. From 10:00 on Wednesday, applicants who received some tickets in the first sale will also be able buy additional ones. Rugby sevens, badminton, hockey, table tennis, squash, bowls and weightlifting are said to have the best availability. Limited tickets also remain for some sessions of athletics, boxing and rhythmic gymnastics. After the second sale commenced at 10:00 on Tuesday, some people went online to express delight at netting the tickets of their choice, while others spoke of delays of "more than 60 minutes" as they tried to book seats online. The official Glasgow 2014 Twitter account welcomed people's patience amid the strong demand. One message said: "We're experiencing very high demand for #2014tickets. The site is up and selling but the queues are large and we appreciate your patience." Another message said: "Call volumes to the ticketing hotline are very high." In feedback made to the BBC news website, one ticket hopeful, Carole Young, said: "Logged on to official site at 10.03 am, now 11.34 am still waiting in a queue very very disappointed." Another, Jacqueline Farrell, said: "I have been sitting on line since 9.15 this morning waiting to log onto our accounts. "The browser kept trying to do something but nothing and then it logged me out and then I had to sign back in and am now in a further 60 minute queue - so, so disappointing." Others, like Fiona, however, expressed their delight at securing tickets: "I was unsuccessful getting tickets in the first ballot and tried again this morning. "Was really pleased to get myself and my daughter day and evening tickets to the rhythmic gymnastics on the 24th July." Craig Martin was also successful: "Was in the queue for about an hour then was allowed to buy tickets - there were quite a few left. "Think I got the last athletics tickets. Also got tickets to see Northern Ireland in netball and tickets for lawn bowls." During the initial four-week window for the Glasgow 2014 Games, there were 2.3 million requests for up to one million tickets. Of the 17 sports on offer, track cycling, diving, swimming, judo, shooting and the 100m sprint final were all over-subscribed and needed ballots to select who received tickets. The second batch of tickets are being allocated on a first-come, first-served basis through the official ticketing website or ticket hotline. From Wednesday the sale will be opened up to people who got some of the tickets they wanted, before all of the Glasgow 2014 ticket applicants are invited to buy tickets until 18:00 on Saturday. Any remaining tickets will then be put on general sale. Ty Speer, deputy chief executive of Glasgow 2014 said: "We're all set for this exciting new phase of ticketing during which there may be periods of high demand as people select and buy their sports and sessions. "At these times we'd appreciate the patience of all customers. We will be working hard to process all orders as quickly as possible." The Commonwealth Games Baton Relay is also currently making its way round the world before returning to Scotland next year. </body>

      <body>A "supertax" on French football - one of President Francois Hollande's flagship policies in his election manifesto - is due to take effect in 2014. French footballers are now going on strike at the end of November in protest. Julian Laurens, a French football writer, told the Today programme: "Some clubs are quite small, and for them paying an extra million a year would be dangerous for their finances. He added: "Fans want the games to go on, they are thinking there is so much money in football that surely the clubs could find an agreement somewhere."

      <body>Four of the big six energy companies have announced price rises in recent weeks, adding pressure to household budgets over the winter. It is estimated five million people in the UK are already living in fuel poverty, which means they spend more than 10% of their income on heating their homes. The campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardo's - says that figure will rise further and become a national crisis.

      <body>If there's any part of the UK that's looking forward to the benefits of growth, it's the North East of England. It has the highest rate of unemployment and the lowest rate of job creation in the country. More than 20% of workers in the North East are employed in the public sector, the highest proportion of the workforce in England. Public sector cuts have hit the region hard since 2010, but like the overall national picture the private sector in the region has continued to create jobs. Exporters have thrived and the North East is now the only region in England that exports more than it imports. So how are businesses and workers feeling about the recovery? Chris Dennell, technician, Quick Hydraulics Chris Dennell thinks nothing of working seven days a week at the Quick Hydraulics factory in North Shields. The 29-year-old has been in the industry for nine years and has never seen business so good. "Work seems to have increased tenfold over the past few years. It's been a real challenge trying to keep up with demand. "We feel we have a responsibility to the company to get the work done - to keep things moving forward." The overtime Chris does at weekends has allowed him to save for his wedding. But despite being in a secure job with annual pay increases he's found the cost of living a challenge. "My wife and I have always budgeted for our monthly outgoings but with the price of gas and electricity going up, we have had to tighten our belts and cut down on the luxuries that we used to buy. "I've given up my season ticket for the football at Sunderland as I can only save for one thing at a time." Andrew Esson, chief executive, Quick Hydraulics Andrew Esson bought Quick Hydraulics two years ago and has not looked back since. The company has gone from 14 employees to 29 and he's hoping to take on more in the coming months. "We feel the pulse of business in the North East and what we are finding is that companies who weren't investing two years ago, are now having funds released and are kicking new projects into action." The company supplies parts to companies in industries ranging from oil and gas to paper processing. Sales are up 25% on last year, with many customers benefiting from booming emerging market economies. "Two years ago I would have said that if you were exporting to Europe, you were not doing well - but now we are seeing that anyone who's exporting is beginning to do well. "Our biggest challenge in the North East is that we have a skills shortage. "We had a board meeting this morning and we agreed to recruit some new staff to keep up with demand, but the challenge is to find people with the right skill levels." James Ramsbotham, chief executive, North East Chamber of Commerce As chairman of a local construction group, James Ramsbotham has seen the strain of the recession up close over the last five years. But in his role as head of the North East Chamber of Commerce, he's becoming increasingly optimistic about the recovery in the region. "Four years ago businesses like Nissan [based in Sunderland] were employing only 3,000 people, now they are employing 6,000. "We are also a major part of the supply chain for the oil and gas sector in the North Sea, which has thrived over the past few years." Mr Ramsbotham says that the nascent economic recovery is beginning to give businesses the confidence they need to expand. "In the first two quarters of this year, we saw some real confidence in sales - both domestic and export sales for which this region does so well. "Now what we've seen is that becoming a confidence to invest in plants and machinery, and also in taking on new staff and training them up." Although the private sector is creating jobs, Mr Ramsbotham says the public sector is still a drag on the local economy. "We've very much got a two-speed economy - we've got the really good engineering and manufacturing industries that are doing incredibly well. "But when you look up in the High Street and you see the retail sector on its knees, you realise the impact that the cuts in the public sector have had on spending in the region." </body>

      <title>The iconic voices of technology</title>
      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>Getting around without your own car in South Africa can drive you crazy, pardon the pun. But a new range of cab hailing applications for smartphones, which use GPS positioning to connect you to the closest cabs, is making it easier to move around. Snappcab, Zapacab, Afta Robot and Go Metro are all examples of local mobile platforms to serve South Africa's diverse commuters. Zapacab became South Africa's first cab hailing mobile platform, when it launched in August. "People are using their phones in smarter and smarter ways," says Rupert Sully, founder of Zapacab. He says the amount of Zapacab users from different demographics is "testimony to this wave that's growing in Africa at the moment, this upsurge of technology, particularly in mobile". Snappcab launched shortly after. Its managing director Anton van Metzinger says safety is of paramount importance: "It's about efficiency. It's about safety." Snappcab tells passengers the driver's name and also allows a commuter to know what their driver and the car look like. The app also allows the commuter to contact the driver directly and plot the driver's headway on a map on their smartphone. The entire trip is on record with Snappcab, providing an extra sense of security and preventing dodgy detours from taking place. Zapacab's Mr Sully says that their drivers are preselected and have received some training, but there are challenges, as introducing the app is not just a "plug and play" process. "They [the drivers] are very comfortable with the whole concept that these markets are becoming more tech-savvy, but just to teach them how to use smartphone interfaces that we place in their cars, is a unique challenge." Teaching the drivers how to use the app is not the only challenge that the local app creators face. They also face competition from global giants such as Uber, which launched in South Africa earlier this month. Uber states that it's "everyone's private driver", it caters to upmarket commuters who want to be chauffeured in luxury cars such as the BMW 7 series and Mercedes Benz S550s and has a presence in around 50 cities worldwide. However, the local firms feel that their apps are tailored for South Africans, and therefore they have an advantage. Mr Sully says that Uber "is not necessarily custom-made for the needs here". "It's not just about replicating things that work elsewhere, it's trying to find out what works here," he states. But Uber's international launcher, Patrick Studener, responds that even though Uber is a global brand, it has localised its product to cater to the South African market and is doing very well in the country. "We don't fly people in from San Francisco to run South Africa. We have South Africans working in South Africa," he says. "We do tackle every problem as it comes locally, and we have local community managers, we have local operations managers who look after the local community and that's the model to making it work locally." Uber also stresses that it was important to come to South Africa because Africa is a "great emerging market space". While Snappcab and Zapacab cater to cab commuters, many South Africans actually travel by minibus taxi, bus and train. The Innovation Hub has funded Snappcab and various other mobile platforms that aim to revolutionise the transportation space, like Go Metro for train users and Afta Robot for mini bus taxi commuters. Gary Bannatyne, incubation business development manager at the Innovation Hub says that there's a huge push for ICT development in the transportation service sector because technology is the only way forward. "Technology is crucial, mobile technology is very crucial in the transport space and it's a huge focus of ours to enable these guys who have the solutions in that space." And the local firms who are making their name in that transport space have ambitions beyond South Africa's borders. Both Zapacab and Snappcab have plans to expand further into Africa. As Zapacab's Mr Sully puts it, their expansion ambitions "really show how technology can go beyond borders to influence the way our markets interact with each other". "[That] really says a lot about how technology is playing out on this continent." </body>

      <body>One thing many entrepreneurs have in common is the way they respond to problems they find irritating or annoying. Instead of just accepting the frustrations they encounter, they try to do something to fix the situation. The result can often be a new kind of business. For Leah Busque, founder of online errand-running business Taskrabbit, the event that caused her to start a company happened one evening when she and her husband had just called a cab to take them to meet friends for dinner. "We realised we had run out of dog food," she says. At the time the couple lived in Boston, Massachusetts, where Ms Busque worked at IBM as a software engineer. Worried that all the shops would be closed on their way home, she and her husband began discussing the problem. "My husband's also in technology, so we've always had these very geeky conversations," she says. "And that night it turned into, 'Wouldn't it be nice if there was just a place online we could go, say we needed dog food, name the price we're willing to pay?' "We were certain that there was someone in our own neighbourhood that would be willing to help us out, and it was just a matter of connecting with them." Before she left the house that evening, Ms Busque used her phone to register an internet domain name for her new business idea. A few months later, she left her job at IBM to work full time on the project. Once they've hit on what they think is a good idea, many entrepreneurs keep it to themselves, fearful that others might steal it. Leah Busque took the opposite approach. She says she talked to "anyone who would listen - family, friends, the guy sitting next to me on the bus, the person in the coffee shop, it didn't matter". She noticed that out of hundreds of conversations "no-one said, 'You're insane. This is not a good idea.' Everyone was like, 'Why doesn't this exist yet?'" Convinced there was a real potential market, she pressed on with her plan. "Ignorance is bliss, I think, when you're first starting out," she says. "I wasn't thinking about starting a company, about raising money, about hiring. I was just thinking, I have to build this idea in my head." Ms Busque began by putting an advertisement on Craigslist, an online classified advertising service, seeking people to help her try out her idea. She was surprised by the response. "I thought I would get all these college students involved that would want to make extra money… but that actually wasn't the case at all," she says. As well as students, there were enquiries from retired people and out-of-work professionals such as lawyers, pharmacists and teachers. But, Ms Busque says, the idea resonated most of all with working mothers. This group seemed not only to be interested in part-time work as errand-runners, but also in becoming customers of the service. "They were trying to balance work and life and kids, and they would love for someone to deliver their groceries or pick up the dry cleaning," Ms Busque says. For her experimental run, Ms Busque spent many hours in local coffee shops interviewing about 100 people, picking 30 of them to take part. The experience helped her later on, when she was developing a more automated vetting and background-checking system for errand-runners. Ms Busque's plan involved creating an online marketplace, where customers who wanted small tasks done could connect with people willing to carry them out. Customers would invite bids for various jobs. The company would offer guidance on pricing for many popular tasks and would take a percentage of the price paid, to cover its costs. A reputation ranking system and profiles of errand-runners would help customers to choose the right person for their job. After a successful small-scale trial, Ms Busque set about building an enterprise. A chance conversation led her to contact Scott Griffith, who was chief executive of car-sharing business Zipcar at the time. Mr Griffith liked the sound of her plans and offered her space in the Zipcar offices while she got the business off the ground. "It was an incredible opportunity," says Ms Busque. "I got to watch [Scott] run a 200-person company and grow it and scale it and raise money of his own right before my eyes." Despite this help, turning an idea into a business was not easy, particularly in late 2008 and 2009. "It was a really tough time to be raising money," says Ms Busque. "We were in a recession. Investors were not investing. And so that was incredibly stressful and took up a lot of time and energy and a lot of late nights wondering if we should continue or not." Ms Busque persisted in her efforts to find backers. A breakthrough came after she spent several weeks attending a business incubator programme in California, run by social networking giant Facebook. "It was kind of like a start-up boot camp - I just learned so much," she says. Partly through connections she made through the incubator programme, she was able to put together a round of seed-funding, so she could take her business to the next stage. It was Ms Busque's first visit to the west coast of the US, and she found the atmosphere of Silicon Valley inspiring. She decided to open a second base in San Francisco, which is where the company now has its headquarters. The firm now operates in several US cities. It is also looking to expand overseas and is planning to launch an operation in the UK soon. Taskrabbit is just one example of a player in the so-called "sharing economy", where firms attempt to use the internet to make better use of facilities that have spare capacity. Other examples include car-ride sharing firm Zimride, wi-fi access sharing business FON, and Airbnb, which enables home owners to rent out spare rooms as holiday accommodation. Compared with, say, a manufacturing business, an internet-based company might seem fairly easy to set up. It also means that online businesses might find they have more competitors than traditional ones. Certainly, Taskrabbit has not found its path to be completely smooth. In July, the company had to lose some staff. Taskrabbit has expanded from domestic errands into offering help to businesses - a field currently dominated by some huge temporary employment agencies. Ms Busque says she's not worried about competition from big players. "The temporary labour industry is one that hasn't been reinvented in decades, and so it's prime for disruption," she says. "We're really excited about tackling that market." It remains to be seen whether Leah Busque and her errand-runners are equal to the task. </body>

      <title>South Africa in bid to end politicians' 'high lifestyle'</title>
      <description>South Africa cracks down on politicians expenses</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24661004</url>

      <body>South Africans have applauded tough new measures announced by Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan to curb government spending on alcohol and air travel, as well as the alleged abuse of credit cards, in an attempt to cut costs. The move came as the African National Congress (ANC) government, in power since white-minority rule ended in 1994, tries to improve its image ahead of next year's election. Though the party is almost certain to be re-elected, its 66% majority is likely to fall amid allegations of failing to do enough to improve the lives of poor people, widespread corruption and abuse of taxpayers' money. South Africans have been overwhelmed with media reports of free spending and high-rolling ministers over the years. One recent example is Northern Cape's new provincial government premier Sylvia Lucas who came in for strong criticism for spending around $5,000 (£3,000) on fast food purchases on a government credit card during her first 10 weeks in office. In his last cabinet reshuffle, President Jacob Zuma fired Communications Minister Dina Pule following allegations that she had allowed her boyfriend to travel with her at the state's expense. Some government ministers have also been embroiled in allegations of rigging tenders in favour of friends. Others have been accused of indulging themselves with cars costing more than $100,000, expensive tastes in wine and five-star accommodation and travel around the world. Delivering his Medium Term Budget Policy Speech in parliament on Wednesday, Mr Gordhan read the riot act to big-spending ministers and public officials. He trimmed the fat on travel perks, blew the bubbles out of excessive alcohol and banned the use of credit cards. From 1 December, no alcohol will be served at government functions and spending on an event should not exceed $200, he said. Also, government ministers and officials will have to fly economy class - no more first or business class - and in fewer numbers and frequency, Mr Gordhan said. The main parliamentary opposition, the Democratic Alliance (DA), said it welcomed the austerity measures against wasteful spending, but said this should have long been the norm. Pieter Mulder, the leader of the small opposition Freedom Front Plus party, agreed. "There's not enough money any more. Now he [Gordhan] comes with all these government discipline measures, which I really think should have been done 20 years ago," he is quoting as saying. Nevertheless, the speech was typical Gordhan, decisive and engaging. He spoke of strong revenue collection, savings of about $80m from under-spending ministries, and a lower than forecast budget deficit of 4.2% which helped allay market fears and bolster sentiment among credit rating agencies. Annabel Bishop, an economist at private firm Investec, said she expected the budget to satisfy the capital markets and impress ratings agencies. "We believe... [the] budget outcome is not likely, in isolation, to prompt any of the rating agencies to downgrade SA's rating," she said. But there were some sad reflections on the year to date. Industrial action in the last year and, in particular a long drawn out two-month strike in the automotive sector, exerted a heavy toll on the economy. Projected GDP growth fell from 2.7% to an anaemic 2.1%. Opposition Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi believes the announcements were nothing more than smoke and mirrors for the benefit of investor confidence. "I think he did just enough to get the credit rating agencies off our back. I think he's sending a very strong signal with regard to cutting ministers' expenses. It's small money in the overall budget but it's sending a strong message," he said. DA spokesman Tim Harris said the mini budget was not nearly bold enough in tackling serious economic problems - or what the treasury calls "labour disputes, electricity shortages and other supply-side disruptions" in Africa's biggest economy. Nevertheless, the hope among many South Africans is that Mr Gordhan has guaranteed economic stability and boosted confidence in South Africa's future. </body>

      <title>India's Grand Prix under threat</title>
      <description>Why India's Formula 1 Grand Prix is under threat</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24659690</url>
      <date>1382657205</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70696000/jpg/_70696139_hi154796718.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Only three years old and with two years to run on its contract, India's Grand Prix is already facing an uncertain future. Bringing Formula 1 to India has cost more than $400m (£246m) and while it attracts some of the world's fastest cars and best drivers, many are questioning if the economic spin-offs are attractive enough for companies to put their money behind the event. The race itself has attracted huge audiences, with tens of thousands at the venue and millions around the world watching it on TV. But is it making enough money? That's the big concern that is dominating the race this year. Though that does not seem to have dampened sponsorship events. Drivers and divas from Bollywood dominate the glamorous events around race day at the Buddh International Race Circuit in Noida on the outskirts of Delhi. McLaren Mercedes F1 driver Sergio Perez accepts that motorsport is yet to capture the imagination of the Indian public. He says it is a shame that the Grand Prix is not happening in India next year. "I think Formula 1 is not very popular here. But the interest is growing among the media and the fans. "India is a very big market for Formula 1 and we should definitely be aiming to come back." F1 boss Bernie Ecclestone announced earlier this year that the 2014 Indian Grand Prix would have to be dropped to tweak the racing calendar. Reportedly, he could not agree on dates with the Indian organisers. F1 management "wanted us to hold the race in March", says Sameer Gaur, chief executive of Jaypee Sports International, which owns and operates the race circuit. "It was not practical to host one now and another in six months. "But there should be no doubt that we will be back in 2015," he says. However, India's motorsports industry has been speculating on a variety of reasons for the cancellation next year. The chief reason is what are seen as unfriendly government policies. The state government of Uttar Pradesh has refused to accept F1 as a sport and instead classifies it as entertainment. This means that organisers need to pay tax and duties on everything connected with the race. Fans too will have to pay entertainment tax on each ticket. So for the Indian infrastructure firm, Jaypee Group - of which Jaypee Sports International is a part - the F1 investment has not come cheap, and the organisers have already been struggling with rising costs and poor revenues. India's rupee has depreciated by over 40% in the past two years, and in August hit an all-time low against the dollar. The Buddh International Circuit is one of the few Formula 1 racetracks in the world that is not backed by government money. Other than the initial investment and operation costs, the venue needs to pay the F1 management an estimated licence fee of $40m annually. The revenues from TV rights and track sponsorships go to the F1 management directly. So the organisers mainly depend on revenues from ticket sales and while the inaugural race in 2011 drew in 95,000 fans, last year it was under 65,000. This year, the figures are estimated to be even lower. Indian Formula 1 driver Karun Chandhok says that while he can understand the government not being involved, "It'll be good if they didn't hinder the process. "Just this week, I have had at least 50 different media people from around the world, and people from teams, engineers who have called me to say, 'Hey, we are stuck in London without a visa, we can't come to the race.' "When you have 700 world media coming to talk about your country and about your race - the only thing they are going to go back with is what a pain it was to get into your country. "We need to iron out these things." In India, it is cricket that dominates the advertisers' wallets. But with number of sponsors growing every year, companies are finding it difficult to make their brand stand out. Last year, India's biggest telecom operator, Bharti Airtel, decided to drop its sponsorship for a cricket series in favour of the Grand Prix. So why is there a question mark hanging over the viability of motorsports here? Image consultant Dilip Cherian, who advises a number of firms on their investment in sports, says it would be judicious for F1 to keep its foot in India. But he too agrees that costs have gone up and large global markets are going through recession. "So while profits may be high, I don't think Indian corporates are paying enough to justify that kind of spend in India in the short run." There are already 22 possible races on the F1 calendar next year - making it one of the longest seasons ever. With Sochi in Russia and New Jersey in the US competing, many feel that once India loses its spot on the racing calendar, it will be tough to get it back. Driver Karun Chandhok points out that F1 is more than just a sport. It is a global calling card, he says, one that can open doors for Indian companies looking to gain an international foothold or for global companies entering the Indian market. "If we really want to help brand India, we need events like F1." So many are hoping that in spite of the break next year, Formula 1 will prove popular enough to get back on track in India soon. </body>

      <title>The older workers who keep going</title>
      <description>'I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home'</description>

      <body>As his 80th birthday approached, Bob Hooker decided to slow down a little. Instead of eight hours a day of painting and decorating, he asked his son and business partner if he could cut down a little - to just seven hours a day. But when big jobs needed to be finished, he still finds himself putting in extra hours up his ladder to get it done. "I think I'd stagnate if I had to stay at home," he says. "I feel sorry for people that have to retire." And a growing number feel the same way. According to official figures, there are 32,000 people in the UK who are in their 80s and still hard at work, a figure that has increased by more than half in the past 10 years. And as the post-war baby boom generation reach their mid-60s, it's becoming increasingly common to work past what used to be the official retirement age. Just over one million people are still working past the age of 65, and 324,000 of those are 70 and over. There are still some jobs you can't do. For example, the danger of sudden medical problems means that airline pilots cannot fly internationally past the age of 65, and if they are over 60, they must have a co-pilot who is under 60. But better lifestyles, better diets and better medicines mean that many people now reach their pension age in good health, with every chance of more healthy years ahead. Not everyone wants to fill those years with Bingo and bowls, though. For Bob, staying in work is not a problem, as he's his own boss. But for big employers, it's not so simple. The NHS is Europe's biggest employer, and it makes extensive use of older workers. In England there are 1,453 GPs, 1,207 hospital doctors and 14,816 nurses and support staff still practising past their 65th birthday. It's conducting an extensive review of the issues raised by working longer. Its research so far suggests that over-65s in good health are just as capable as their younger counterparts. Extending the working life of staff helps to fill skill shortages. But would older workers require easier shift patterns? Is that fair to their younger colleagues? And how do you evaluate if someone is no longer up to the job? These are all unanswered questions. The government is certainly keen to see more older workers. Compulsory retirement in the UK was abolished in 2011, and the state pension age is due to increase to 68 by 2048. As a nation, extending working lives is seen as a vital to keeping the country's pension system in balance - and if everyone worked for an extra year, it would add 1% to national income, according to government estimates. But many work longer because they need the extra money. Eddie Friel is a removal man from Glasgow. At the age of 68, he drives the length and breadth of Scotland, sometimes further afield, often sleeping in his van, and helping his colleagues load and unload. He loves his job, but he couldn't afford to retire. "I do need the money," he says. "If I'm left with my government pension and my company pension I have not got enough." The self-employed are particularly likely to be in this position. Some 47% of employees aged 60 to 64 are saving for a pension, but only 20% of the self-employed do. Many of those will reach 65 without enough money to fund the lifestyle they want. But if all these people are retiring later, are they taking jobs from the young? Eddie says he doesn't see a lot of young people wanting to do his physically demanding job. If he did, he'd be happy to go part-time to make way for them. There are obviously examples where an older worker occupies an individual position which another younger worker might want. And in 2011, a survey by the law firm Norton Rose found that more than a fifth of companies would find it harder to hire younger workers after the state retirement age was abolished. But older people in work will earn more, and spend more, creating extra economic activity. That should create employment opportunities for other workers, young and old. And many professions complain of a shortage of qualified staff. The Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development estimates that there will be nearly two vacancies created for each school or college leaver over the next 10 years. It's yet another reason why the number of people working past 65 has nearly doubled in the past 10 years. Government policy, demographics and business needs all seem likely to push that number even higher. And if current trends continue, there will soon be a lot more 80-year-olds up ladders like Bob Hooker. For many, the traditional idea of retirement is looking just a little old-fashioned. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. The move was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos confirmed it would reopen the plant and the neighbouring oil refinery "with immediate effect", ending a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official. The company said the move to reopen the plant followed a "dramatic U-turn" by Unite and its "belated recognition" that the company's survival plan was the only way to ensure Grangemouth's long-term future. Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the announcement as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he said. "They have been through a hell of a week and I hope they have a much better weekend as a result of today's announcement." Ineos' future plans include investing a further £300m in the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance a gas terminal, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He told the BBC that the Grangemouth complex "should have a life for many years to come, as long as we can get this gas terminal built and we can sign up gas contracts and bring gas in from America". Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." The closure move came after workers rejected a deal which would have changed their pay and pensions. Ministers and Unite were involved in top-level talks on Thursday to try to save the site and a fresh offer was made by unions to the company. </body>

      <title>Firefighters to stage more strikes</title>
      <description>Firefighters in England and Wales are to strike on 1 and 4 November in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says.</description>

      <body>Firefighters in England and Wales are to stage two more strikes in the run-up to bonfire night in a row over pensions, the Fire Brigades Union says. The government wants firefighters to work up to 60 but the union says this is too old to be fighting fires. FBU members are due to walk out on 1 November from 18:30 to 23:00 GMT and on 4 November from 06:00 to 08:00 GMT. In the first round of action last month, 32,000 union members in England and Wales walked out, the FBU said. A second strike was called off earlier this month after progress was made during talks. The FBU postponed the five-hour strike saying that the government and fire employers had shifted their position and recognised that firefighters faced losing their jobs and a "large chunk" of their pensions under new changes imposed in April. However, the FBU now says the government and fire employers have failed to offer any firm guarantees on jobs or pensions. FBU general secretary Matt Wrack said: "The Westminster government has created this mess, but it is refusing to clear it up. "It now recognises the problem but it won't provide the legal and financial guarantees firefighters need to ensure they have a job and an unreduced pension in the future. "Firefighters face the sack towards the end of their career and the loss of their pension. That can't be right. "The employers promised to tackle the issue of firefighters facing the sack for failing fitness tests last week, only to say they can't offer any guarantees this week. "That is simply not the way to run a public service. "The government is now making threats to withdraw some of the other concessions they have made this year." London Fire Commissioner Ron Dobson said it was prepared to deal with further strikes and would have 27 fire engines based at strategic points across the capital. "The evening strike date falls on the Friday before bonfire night. It is just before Diwali and coincides with half-term, so people need to be really careful with fireworks and bonfires," he said. During the first strike on 25 September, contingency plans at the 46 fire services in England and three in Wales included using part-time and volunteer firefighters, calling in non-union fire crews and bringing in private contractors. The armed forces had a back-up role and in the event of a major incident, union members could have returned to work. No major incidents were reported during the four-hour strike which was the first national walkout for a decade. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and rival G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shares in Serco were up 2.8% after the news. Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The head of G4S, Richard Morris, stepped down on Thursday.

Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shares in Serco were up 2.8% after the news. Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The head of G4S, Richard Morris, stepped down on Thursday. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <body>Actors David Tennant and Olivia Coleman have helped ITV's Broadchurch win four prizes - dubbed the Daggers - at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards. The pair picked up the best actor and actress awards for their roles in the drama, with co-star Andrew Buchan named best supporting actor. Broadchurch also won the TV prize, with Bond movie Skyfall named best film. Martina Cole and Wilbur Smith were also inducted into the Crime Writers' Association Hall of Fame at the event. The pair were honoured in recognition of their contributions to the genre. The awards - which marked the culmination of ITV3's Crime Thriller Book Club - included a new award for the club's best read, which went to Malcolm MacKay for The Necessary Death Of Lewis Winter. After beating books by Linwood Barclay, Megan Abbott, Christopher Fowler, Diana Bretherick and Andrew Taylor, the author said it was "a huge honour and thrill to win". Mick Herron picked up the coveted Gold Dagger award for best crime novel of the year for Dead Lions. "My shelves are crammed with Gold Dagger-winning novels of the past - The Mermaids Singing, Black and Blue, Bones and Silence. I can't quite believe I get to put my own book next to them," he said. The best new crime writer prize went to Derek B Miller for his debut novel Norwegian By Night Roger, while Roger Hobbs's Ghostman was named best thriller of the year. Other awards went to Amelia Bullmore, who won best supporting actress for her role in ITV's Scott and Bailey, while Danish series The Killing III won the best international TV prize.

      <body>Singer Manolo Escobar, whose best-selling track Y Viva Espana became part of Spain's cultural identity in the 1970s, has died aged 82. Escobar died at home in the town of Benidorm surrounded by his family, after a long fight against cancer. He was "a symbol who lived in the musical landscape of Spaniards for half a century," Spain's culture minister, Jose Ignacio Wert, said in a statement. "Music is my life," Escobar said this month. "I will never surrender." "I am happy because I have work and because, moreover, people are still prepared to pay to see me on stage," the singer said in an interview with Spanish newspaper ABC. "I want to return to a few of the places I have been to in my career of more than 50 years and say goodbye for good. I will sing one more time in each one so that I don't go back," he added. Born in a small village outside Almeria in October 1931, Escobar had a huge following in Spain in the 1960s and 1970s with hits such as El Porompompero and Mi Carro. A well-known personality thanks to his television show Canta Manolo Escobar, he also starred in films including The Guerrillas and Father Manolo, in which he played a singing priest. But it was the success of Y Viva Espana, in 1973, that made him an international star. The track was based on Eviva Espana, the 1971 song written by Belgian duo Leo Rozenstraten and Leo Caerts, and performed, in Dutch, by Samantha. Escobar's best-selling single - released to coincide with Spain's transition from dictatorship to democracy and a boom in international tourism - sold an estimated six million copies. In 1974, the track was covered by Swedish singer Sylvia Vrethammar, whose English version reached number four in the UK Singles Chart. One of Escobar's last big acts was in July 2010 when he sang with the Spanish football team to celebrate their victory in the World Cup in South Africa. He announced his retirement from music at the end of 2012 after 50 years on the stage. Last month, he had to cancel the final dates of his farewell tour after falling ill. He was undergoing treatment, reportedly for colon cancer, at Benidorm's Hospital Clinica, but is understood to have left on Tuesday. He died at home two days later. Escobar leaves a wife, Anita, and one daughter, Vanessa. </body>

      <body>An Edinburgh author has been named the winner of the Edinburgh International Book Festival's 2013 First Book Award. Angela Jackson, one of 42 writers in contention, said it felt "particularly special" to win the prize for her debut novel, The Emergence of Judy Taylor. Visitors to this year's festival voted her book ahead of other first works by such authors as Gill Hornby, sister of Nick, and broadcaster Dawn O'Porter. Jackson's novel tells of a dissatisfied wife who embarks on a new life. "It's great to know I'm on the right track [and] that my work is connecting with readers," the author continued. The former musician and psychology lecturer said the prize would "spur [her] on to complete my second novel". Nick Barley, director of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, said Jackson's triumph was "a wonderful, home-grown success story". "Angela gave her first public reading at the Book Festival in 2010 and appeared again in 2011," he continued. "We were delighted to welcome her this year as a fully fledged and published author." Edinburgh's book festival, held every August in the city's Charlotte Square Gardens, celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. </body>

      <title>Sculptor Sir Anthony Caro dies</title>
      <description>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro, widely regarded as one of the greatest of his generation, dies at the age of 89.</description>

      <body>British sculptor Sir Anthony Caro has died of a heart attack at the age of 89, his family has confirmed. Sir Anthony was widely regarded as the greatest British sculptor of his generation and worked as an assistant to Henry Moore in the 1950s. Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "one of the outstanding sculptors of the past 50 years". Among his many prizes was 2008's Jack Goldhill Award for Sculpture for his piece Promenade. Awarded by the Royal Academy of Arts, the £10,000 prize goes to the creator of "an outstanding piece of sculpture". The artist had vowed to keep working until he was 100, as he unveiled his most recent exhibition at the Gagosian Gallery in London in June. He told The Independent: "It's what I like doing. Old age is a shock, but I still enjoy making the works." "I look forward to going into the studio. I would be bored if I didn't do that." Sir Anthony played a pivotal role in the development of 20th Century sculpture, after first coming to public attention with a show at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1963. There, he exhibited large abstract sculptures, such as Early One Morning (1962), which were brightly painted and stood directly on the ground to engage the spectator on a one-to-one basis. It was a radical departure from the way sculpture had been seen in the past and paved the way for future developments in three-dimensional art. "I did break something open at the beginning," Sir Anthony said in June. "A tremendous lot of possibilities opened up to me when that happened, and I've been exploring these different areas for the rest of my life." The artist added: "Sculpture did have some assumptions and some, well, rules almost and I broke those rules." He was born in Surrey in 1924 and studied engineering at Christ's College Cambridge, before going on to specialise in sculpture at the Royal Academy Schools in London until 1952. Sir Anthony then went on to influence others as a teacher at St Martin's School of Art in London from 1953 to 1981. There he inspired a younger generation of British sculptors including Phillip King, Tony Cragg, Barry Flanagan, Richard Long and Gilbert and George. In the early 1950s he had started his own sculpting career by making rugged bronze animal and human figures, which were said to be concerned with "what it is like to be inside the body". His more famous later work, which questioned assumptions about form, material and subject matter in sculpture, can currently be seen in a major exhibition at The Museo Correr in Venice until 27 October. In a statement following his death, Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota called him "a man of great humility and humanity whose abundant creativity, even as he approached the age of 90, was still evident in the most recent work". Sir Anthony was also awarded the Praemium Imperiale for Sculpture in Tokyo in 1992 and the Lifetime Achievement Award for Sculpture in 1997. He was knighted in 1987 and received the Order of Merit in May 2000, which recognises great achievement in the fields of the arts, learning, literature and science, and he was the subject of a major retrospective at Tate Britain in 2005. With Norman Foster and Tony Fitzpatrick he co-designed London's landmark Millennium Bridge, but the £18.2m project had to be closed down three days after it was opened in June 2000, as it swayed "alarmingly". Engineers blamed the "synchronised footfall" effect of hundreds of people stepping in unison and it was reopened nearly two years in February 2002, after £5m of modifications. Sir Anthony was married to painter Sheila Girling, with whom he had two sons and three grandchildren. He had a close relationship with the Royal Academy of Arts throughout his career and chief executive Charles Saumarez Smith has paid tribute to the late Royal Academician. "Sir Anthony Caro OM CBE RA was one of the greatest sculptors in the second half of the twentieth century," said Saumarez Smith. "He was elected as a Senior Member of the Royal Academy on 9 March 2004 and will be much missed by the RA as well as his friends and admirers internationally." </body>

      <title>Jailed artist wins portrait prize</title>
      <description>Australian artist Nigel Milsom, who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs, has won the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize</description>

      <body>A prominent Australian artist who was jailed earlier this year for robbing a convenience store while high on drugs has won a major national art prize. Nigel Milsom was awarded the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize, winning $150,000, for his portrait Uncle Paddy. He pleaded guilty to robbing a 7-11 store in Sydney in April 2012. He later apologised to police, saying he thought he was "buying doughnuts". Milsom, a former security guard, is serving six years for armed robbery. The artist, who suffers from depression, completed the painting earlier this year while on bail awaiting sentencing for the crime. The winning portrait was picked by 2009 Moran Prize winner Ben Quilty and ex-Art Gallery of South Australia director Daniel Thomas, who were not told the names of the artists. "The fact is it was the best painting," Quilty told the Australian newspaper. "I judged the painting, not him." "Even someone who has gotten into some state of punishment for whatever he did could come good," said judge Daniel Thomas . "So that's how I reconciled myself with Milsom getting that money." He praised Milsom's "extraordinarily refined technique, the brushwork, so smooth, so delicate". Uncle Paddy depicts one of Milsom's grandfather's oldest friends; Thomas called it "a very old-fashioned Australian face". "There is a quiet sadness about Paddy that seems to stem from the realisation that death will be visiting him soon, too," said Milsom. "When I painted his portrait I got a sense that he has learnt to sit with this feeling of sadness, which has given him a greater strength and wisdom." The Moran Prize, which annually awards contemporary Australian portraiture, is now in its 25th year. All the winning pictures become part of the Moran Arts Foundation Collection. Last year Milsom won the $30,000 art prize for the 2012 Sulman Prize. Weeks later, armed with a knife, axe and a fake gun, he and another man threatened to kill a shopkeeper while holding him hostage in the store room of a 7-11 store, reported the Telegraph. "My state of mind is hard to describe ... I thought I was buying doughnuts,'" he told the court earlier this year. "It felt like I was watching something as a movie that wasn't really happening." At the time of the crime, the court heard the artist had recently lost his mentor, art curator Nick Waterlow, and his sister, and was high on a combination of heroin, crystal meth, prescription drugs and alcohol. </body>

      <title>Alan Davies pays damages over tweet</title>
      <description>Comedian Alan Davies pays damages after retweeting a post linking Tory peer Lord McAlpine's name to a TV report on paedophilia, the High Court hears.</description>

      <body>Comedian Alan Davies has paid damages after he retweeted a post linking a Tory peer's name to a TV report on a "senior political figure who is a paedophile", the High Court has heard. Mr Davies apologised for the "great damage and distress" his post caused ex-Conservative Party deputy chairman Lord McAlpine, his lawyer said. He accepted the "allegations" were "completely untrue", his lawyer added. Lord McAlpine's solicitor said his client accepted Davies' apology. But speaking after the hearing at the London court, Andrew Reid added: "The fact remains that both he [Lord McAlpine] and his family have been caused immeasurable distress which cannot be rectified. "There still remain people influenced by this tweet and all the apologies in the world are not going to put the situation back to where it was." Mr Davies said he "stood by" the public apology he issued at the time and had made a donation of £13,000 to the NSPCC in an attempt to make amends. "I hoped those steps might avoid legal action but in March press reports appeared saying I was going to be sued for £200,000," he said in a statement issued after the hearing. "I offered to pay £15,000 in damages plus a contribution to costs and agreed to make today's statement in court. "From my own experience, I am able to warn others of the dangers of retweeting." During the hearing, which neither Lord McAlpine nor Mr Davies attended, lawyers for both outlined details of the libel action to the judge, Mr Justice Tugendhat. Sir Edward Garnier QC, for Lord McAlpine, said on 2 November last year the then "managing editor of the Bureau of Investigative Journalism" tweeted: "If all goes well we've got a Newsnight out tonight about a very senior political figure who is a paedophile." Sir Edward said the prospect prompted further Twitter activity. Newsnight broadcast the report about the sexual abuse of boys at the Bryn Estyn children's home in Wrexham, Clwyd, in the 1970s and 1980s, and accused an unnamed "leading Conservative politician from the Thatcher years of sexually abusing boys in care". Sir Edward said that, prior to the broadcast, Mr Davies tweeted: "Any clues who this Tory paedophile is...?" He said a few minutes later Mr Davies received a reply which contained links to three websites, including to an article about an inquiry into abuse at the Bryn Estyn home and to a Swedish website which "purported to report on a paedophile ring in the British establishment". Sir Edward said the reply tweet then said "lord mcalpine, some would say". He added: "Most unfortunately, Mr Davies retweeted that tweet. At the time he had a substantial number of followers on Twitter - in excess of 400,000." Mr Davies' lawyer Steve Hudson told the judge: "Mr Davies withdraws the allegation made on Twitter unreservedly and apologises sincerely to Lord McAlpine for the great damage and distress his tweeting has caused him." He added: "Mr Davies hopes that as a result of this matter other Twitter users will be more aware of the potential damaging consequences of tweeting and be more careful in how they use that platform." On Tuesday, Lord McAlpine's libel action against Sally Bercow, wife of Commons Speaker John Bercow, was formally settled at the same court. Mrs Bercow had already apologised and paid the peer undisclosed damages for a defamatory tweet linking Lord McAlpine to false claims of child sex abuse allegations. Meanwhile, Ofcom has upheld complaints over episodes of Newsnight and This Morning that led to the peer being wrongly implicated. Lord McAlpine was not named but the watchdog ruled that airing the claims while there was internet speculation about the alleged abuser's identity had led to Lord McAlpine being incorrectly identified. </body>

      <body>The centenary of World War I is to be marked in a National Portrait Gallery show of paintings, films and sculptures inspired by the conflict. The Great War in Portraits will run at the central London gallery from 27 February until 15 June, 2014. The exhibition will include two films made about the Battle of the Somme from different sides of the lines. It will also feature portraits of Sir Winston Churchill and war poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon. Paintings and photographs of soldiers decorated for bravery will be shown alongside prisoners of war, the wounded and those shot at dawn for cowardice. Major loans on display will include expressionist artworks by Lovis Corinth and Max Beckmann and Ludwig Kirchner's Selbstbildnis als Soldat - Self-portrait as a Soldier. Also on show will be portraits of the generals who plotted the course of the war and a photograph of assassin Gavrilo Princip whose murder of Archduke Franz Ferdinand triggered the conflict. Other highlights will include Jacob Epstein's The Rock Drill, one of the great early modernist works related to the war, and a rare photograph by Jules Gervais Courtellemont depicting a battle-scarred, deserted landscape. The gallery will host a range of activities linked to the centenary including two special performances by the Portrait Choir inspired by the war. Exhibition curator Paul Moorhouse said: "The Great War in Portraits explores a complex range of human experience. "Evolving different roles, responsibilities and destinies, it illuminates the way war was represented through portraits of individuals - each caught up in events beyond reason or control." </body>

      <body>Rebecca Stead has won this year's Guardian children's fiction prize for her novel Liar And Spy, about an 11-year-old boy who hides from reality by pretending to be a detective. She is the first US-based author to win, after changes to the rules. Stead's competition included The Fault In Our Stars by John Green, David Almond's The Boy Who Swam with Piranhas and Katherine Rundell's Rooftoppers. Judges said Liar And Spy, Stead's third novel, was "incredibly sensitive". "Its central characters are all children who have complexities in their lives which they are dealing with," said Julia Eccleshare, The Guardian's children's books editor and chair of the judges. "It's a novel about how children have to navigate the world. It is a quiet book, but although the drama is finely-tuned, the overall impact is powerful, moving and surprising," she said. All of Stead's novels are set in New York, where she grew up, and where Liar And Spy's main character Georges is nicknamed "Gorgeous" at school because of the silent "s" his parents have included in his name. His life gets steadily worse when he moves into a new apartment block as his dad loses his job and his mum has to work longer shifts. He then gets caught up in a spying game with another boy living in the block and embarks on a journey of self-discovery. Lottie Longshanks, one of the winners of the Young Critics Competition 2013 - also announced on Wednesday night - told The Guardian it was "a very well written story, with lots of quirky characters and some important messages". Stead, whose second book When You Reach Me won the 2010 Newbery medal, is a former lawyer who turned to writing after the birth of her children. She told the newspaper she was inspired by the "tough time" she had negotiating her school years. "I felt vulnerable and very much between friends. This wasn't because I had some horrific bullying story, but because of a steady drip of negativity," said Stead. "I was thinking about how something so un-sensational, so un-dramatic, coloured my life so completely." The prize, which was founded in 1967, comes with a cheque for £1,500 and was opened up to writers who are not resident in the UK last year. It is awarded annually to fiction written for children aged eight and above, and is the only children's fiction award selected by fellow writers. The judging panel also included Andy Mulligan, winner of the 2011 Guardian children's fiction prize, Jason Wallace, author of Out of the Shadows, which won the Costa award in 2010, and Binny for Short writer Hilary McKay, who won the Guardian prize in 1992. </body>

Symmons Roberts won the Forward prize for best collection with Drysalter.

"Congratulations to those poets who made it and those who didn't, so much of whose work I read with enormous delight and envy." The shortlist was chosen from 113 books submitted by publishers. The winner of the prize, now in its 20th year, will be announced on 13 January 2014. The winner will be presented with a cheque for £15,000, donated by the T S Eliot Trustees.

      <body>British actor Jamie Dornan will replace Charlie Hunnam in the forthcoming film adaptation of erotic bestseller Fifty Shades of Grey. Belfast-born Dornan, best known for his roles in BBC drama The Fall and US fantasy series Once Upon A Time, will play lead character Christian Grey. "Stow your twitchy palms ladies ... our man is here," confirmed Fifty Shades author EL James on Twitter. He is expected to sign up for at least three films based on the book trilogy. Published in 2011, Fifty Shades of Grey follows the sexually-charged relationship between billionaire Grey and college student Anastasia Steele, who will be played by Dakota Johnson - daughter of Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. The novel and its two sequels, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have become a literary phenomenon that earned author James a reported $95m (£61.5m) last year. There has been intense speculation over who will star in the film adaptation, which will be directed by another Briton, artist Sam Taylor-Johnson. Dornan is understood to have screen-tested for the role before Hunnam was cast, reports Variety. Universal Studios have yet to officially confirm his casting. Hunnam dropped out of the role earlier this month. Universal Pictures said his sudden departure was a mutual decision due to a scheduling problem with the actor's TV commitments. However, there have been reports that the Sons of Anarchy actor had been overwhelmed by the media attention. He was also reported to have been dissatisfied with Kelly Marcel's screen adaptation. Closer's Patrick Marber, who was Oscar-nominated for his Notes on a Scandal screenplay, is currently working on the screenplay, with Universal hoping to begin shooting next month. </body>

      <body>Dark Knight Rises star Tom Hardy will play Sir Elton John in a biopic of the singer's life called Rocketman, it has been announced. The 36-year-old British actor previously played Bane in The Dark Knight Rises and has starred in films such as Inception, Lawless and Bronson. Rocketman is being made with the co-operation of Sir Elton, 66, who is an executive producer on the project. It will begin shooting in late 2014, Focus Features said. The screenplay has been penned by Lee Hall, who was Oscar-nominated for Billy Elliot, and recently worked on the film adaptation of War Horse. It follows Reginald Dwight's journey from childhood piano prodigy to global superstar, under his stage name Elton John. Hardy is respected for his wide-ranging talent, but his brawny, tattooed frame makes him an unconventional choice to star as the flamboyant musician. He is not the first actor to play Sir Elton. In 2001, Justin Timberlake appeared as a "young Elton" in the video for the latter's This Train Don't Stop There Any More. Last month, Sir Elton John played live at the Emmy Awards ceremony for the first time. He performed a tribute to Liberace, the American pianist and vocalist whose life was told in the recent biopic, Behind the Candelabra. </body>

      <title>Tim Rice unveils Eternity musical</title>
      <description>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked".</description>

      <body>Sir Tim Rice has unveiled his new West End show From Here to Eternity, admitting that it might leave some audience members "mildly shocked". The adaptation of James Jones' uncensored 1951 novel is Sir Tim's first totally new musical for 13 years. Written with composer Stuart Brayson, the story follows the love affairs of US soldiers stationed in Hawaii in the run-up to the attack on Pearl Harbor. The new version includes swearing, nudity and a scene in a gay bar. Some of the more explicit scenes will come as a surprise to fans of the 1953 Oscar-winning film, starring Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr, which included a famous scene in which the couple share a passionate clinch on a beach. "The film was wonderful but it was made in 1953 and, 60 years on, we can take different aspects of the book and look at it through 21st Century eyes," Sir Tim told the BBC after Wednesday's opening night. "Some people might be mildly shocked but I think we've all got used to a bit of that these days. It's quite mild compared with Book of Mormon or even Billy Elliot." The cast includes Darius Campbell as Sergeant Warden, Rebecca Thornhill as his married lover Karen Holmes, Robert Lonsdale as Private Prewitt, Siubhan Harrison as his lover Lorene, and Ryan Sampson as Private Maggio. Campbell said that, during previews, there had been some walkouts from the show due to its content. "The James Jones novel really portrayed homosexuality and prostitution in the way that it existed in those days and we've dived in head first. We've explored that in a way that's very real and gritty, and honours the story." The Scottish singing star, who shot to fame as Darius Danesh on TV show Pop Idol, went on: "It hasn't been without some of the older audience walking out. "Maybe some of the nudity, swearing and explicitness have been too much for them, but a younger audience and an audience who have loved the film - and wanted to see more - have been giving us standing ovations and for that we are all grateful." 'Quite dangerous' Sir Tim Rice is best known for his partnership with Andrew Lloyd Webber on shows such as Joseph and his Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat, Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. Lord Lloyd-Webber's new West End musical Stephen Ward is due to open in December. Sir Tim confirmed that his former writing partner had already seen a preview of From Here to Eternity. "He was very complimentary and I'm hoping to see his show," he said. Sir Tim's last full musical was 2000's Aida, which he wrote with Elton John. The pair had earlier worked together on The Lion King. From Here to Eternity sees the Oscar-winning lyricist team up with the relatively unknown Brayson. The pair first met in the 1980s when Brayson approached Sir Tim in the street and asked him to listen one of his songs on cassette. "I played it in car on way home. I rang him up and said this is rather good. I couldn't do much to help his pop career but when he began writing musicals I thought, 'maybe I can help,'" Sir Tim said. Although Sir Tim hadn't intended to be involved in writing the musical, as the production took shape he "ended up doing all the lyrics apart from one or two lines". Brayson told the BBC: "I must have sent him eight or nine musicals and this was the one that he really went for. "We didn't set out to do the movie. We set out out to do something that was different and quite dangerous in parts." In the audience on Wednesday night was James Jones' daughter, Kaylie, and her brother, Jamie. "We had our doubts when the idea first came up," she admitted after the show, "but I'm thrilled - it's so sophisticated and moving." She added: "I was so delighted they put in the gay bar scenes because my dad said this is just the way it was back then. "I think my father would have been amazed." From Here to Eternity, directed by Tamara Harvey, is booking at the Shaftesbury Theatre, London, until 26 April 2014. </body>

      <title>Nude Turner Prize model criticised</title>
      <description>A Turner Prize sculpture of a nude man causes controversy among schools in Northern Ireland.</description>

      <body>A Turner Prize sculpture of a nude man has caused controversy among some schools in Northern Ireland. The prestigious exhibition opened to the public in Londonderry on Wednesday morning, the first time it has been taken outside of England. The entries are on show at former Army barracks at Ebrington. Derry is the UK City of Culture 2013. David Shrigley's naked model has been avoided by a number of schools because it shows a man urinating into a bucket. Glasgow-based Shrigley is best known for his humorous line drawings, but also makes sculptures, photographs, paintings and animated films. His work, which combines jokes and commentary, can be found on greeting cards, in books and in magazines, as well as in galleries. Schools from across Northern Ireland have been invited to the exhibition. Ann Murray, the principal of Oakgrove Integrated Primary School in Derry, said: "This particular piece of art is too much for some students. "We have younger people at the school, so I'd rather have their parents take them to see Shrigley's piece rather than the school. "We talked about Shrigley's piece, but we avoided that particular gallery. "Some parents may find it really offensive." Jack Malvern, the arts correspondent with The Times newspaper, said: "I personally don't think it's offensive. "What we have here is teachers who are worried about parents' potential reactions rather than their actual reactions. "If one parent says no then the entire class is excluded. It's a shame. "There is nothing offensive about this, it's humorous. "When I was speaking to people in Derry they told me that you have to take into consideration local sensitivities. They said they are a more socially conservative society." Denis Feeney, vice principal of St John's Primary School in Derry, said: "We didn't go to the Shrigley piece because it just wasn't appropriate. "The Turner experience was fantastic all round, but we thought it was just a bit much." Established in 1984, the Turner Prize is awarded to a contemporary artist under 50, living, working or born in Britain, who is judged to have put on the best exhibition of the last 12 months. The winner will receive £25,000 and the result will be announced on 2 December. The other shortlisted artists will each receive £5,000. </body>

      <body>The female head of the Qatar Museums Authority (QMA) has been named the most powerful figure in the art world. Sheikha Al-Mayassa bint Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani came top of ArtReview magazine's annual Power 100 due to "her organisation's vast purchasing power". Sheikha Al-Mayassa first appeared on the Power 100 in 2011 at number 90, rising to number 11 in 2012. China's Ai Weiwei, who topped the countdown in 2011, is the highest-placed artist at number nine. Other familiar names in the top 10 include art dealer Larry Gagosian, ranked at four, and Tate director Sir Nicholas Serota, placed at six. The latter was made a Companion of Honour by Prince Charles on Wednesday at Buckingham Palace in recognition of his services to art. Sheikha Al-Mayassa is the sister of Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, who assumed the role of Qatar's emir when his father abdicated in June. According to ArtReview, the QMA spends around $1bn a year (£618m) developing galleries, sponsoring film festivals and supporting public art. It also sponsored Tate Modern's Damien Hirst exhibition, which attracted more than 463,000 visitors during its run last year. Last year's Power 100 was also topped by a woman - Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev, the curator of the influential Documenta 13 exhibition in Kassel, Germany. David Zwirner, who owns galleries in London and New York, is in second place in this year's rundown, while his former business partner Iwan Wirth is ranked at three. Sir Nicholas comes just behind Hans Ulrich Obrist and Julia Peyton-Jones, the co-creators of the Serpentine galleries in London. Compiled by a 13-member international jury, the Power 100 is described as "a unique snapshot of the contemporary art scene". According to the contemporary art magazine, those included are "judged on their international influence over the production of art and contribution to the art world during the past 12 months". </body>

      <title>Sophia Loren wins 39-year tax feud</title>

      <body>An Italian supreme court ruling has put an end to a 39-year legal dispute between Oscar-winning film star Sophia Loren and Italian tax authorities. The argument centred around Loren's earnings in 1974. She claimed tax was owed on 60% of her income, but the state said it should be 70%. The Court of Cassation ruled in her favour, saying the actress's earnings were covered by a 1982 tax amnesty. "A saga that has lasted nearly 40 years is finally over," said Loren. "I always look to the future and I leave bad experiences like this one behind me," she was quoted as saying by the La Stampa daily newspaper. Her lawyer, Giovanni Desideri, said: "The supreme court has wrapped up a Kafkaesque case." Loren, who was born Sofia Scicolone and started her film career in 1950, famously spent 17 days in prison in 1982 in a separate tax dispute - an incident that drew her fans to the jail near Naples. She said at the time that her tax specialist had erred, meaning her tax return understated her earnings by about 5 million lire (then $7,000). Entering the prison, she said she was being subjected to "an unjust situation due to a little mistake by a tax specialist". The actress shot to fame internationally when she acted alongside Cary Grant in the 1958 film Houseboat. She won an Oscar for her heart-rending performance in 1961 film Two Women about a mother raped while protecting her daughter in war-torn Italy. In July, she was photographed on the set of a film version of Jean Cocteau's 1930 play La Voix Humaine - The Human Voice - which will be directed by her son Edoardo Ponti. </body>

      <body>Animated snail-racing tale Turbo has beaten Tom Hanks's true-life hostage drama Captain Phillips to the top of this week's UK box office. The Dreamworks film earned £3.9m including previews, compared with the £3.4m of Hanks's Paul Greengrass-directed thriller. Action stars Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone's prison break film Escape Plan was third with £961,470. The top five was rounded off by Prisoners and Sunshine on Leith. This week's figures are a lift on the previous seven days when Prisoners topped the chart for a third consecutive week, in a weekend which saw no release make more than £1m. Turbo, which features the voices of Ryan Reynolds and rapper Snoop Dogg, flopped when it was released in the US earlier this year, earning $21m (£13m) over its first weekend. With a reported budget of $135m (£83.6m) it only made $82.6m (£51.2m) in North America during its run, although it has since earned more than $224m (£139m) worldwide. Hanks, meanwhile, has won rave reviews for his role in the film about a container ship seized by Somali pirates in the Indian Ocean in 2009. The film opened this year's London Film Festival. Bollywood action film Boss, starring Akshay Kumar, opened at number nine despite opening in just 63 screens. Averaging £3,732 per cinema, it took significantly more than Escape Plan's average of £2,656 per location across 362 screens. Romantic drama Enough Said, starring Sopranos actor James Gandolfini in one of his final film roles opposite Julia Louis-Dreyfuss, missed out on a top 10 place but earned a respectable £170,357 from its 79 screens. While a second bad week for Wikileaks drama The Fifth Estate, starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Julian Assange, saw it fall out of the top 10 to 13 after taking £118,397. </body>

      <body>Indian singer Manna Dey has died in a Bangalore hospital at the age of 94. He had been ill for the past few months and was in hospital for a respiratory infection. His funeral is due to take place later on Thursday. Born Prabodh Chandra Dey in 1919, Dey was popularly known as Manna, and chalked up a number of hit Bollywood songs in a career spanning six decades. Tributes have been pouring in for the legendary singer from the government, the film industry and his fans. President Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led the country in paying tributes to Dey. India "has lost a veteran playback singer, a versatile artist of extraordinary ability and a creative genius who mesmerised listeners with his enchanting voice," the president said. The prime minister described Dey as the "king of melody" and said with his death, the music world had lost one of its most talented artistes. "I am deeply saddened to hear of the demise of the King of Melody, Manna Dey. An accomplished singer with a unique voice, he was multi-talented and excelled in Rabindra Sangeet and various other forms of popular music," he said in his condolence message. "In his death, the music world has lost one of its most talented artistes. Dey's legacy will, however, live on through the many songs he sang," Mr Singh added. Dey sang in several languages including Hindi, Bengali, Assamese, Marathi, Kannada, Punjabi and Bhojpuri. His long career saw him win several awards for his contribution to music, including state honours like the Padma Shri in 1971 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2005. He was also given the prestigious Dadasaheb Phalke Award in 2007. Dey sang more than 3,500 songs, including romantic ballads, intricate raga-based songs, Qawwalis and fast-paced modern numbers in his career. Along with Mohammad Rafi, Mukesh, and Kishore Kumar, he made up what was known as the "famous quartet of singers" who dominated the Hindi film music industry from 1950s to 1970s. Many of Dey's tracks for Bollywood films became huge hits and he sang for some of the biggest Bollywood names like Raj Kapoor, Rajesh Khanna and Dharmendra. His most popular numbers included Zindagi kaisi hai paheli (Life, what a riddle it is) from the film Anand; Poocho na kaise maine raen bitayee (Don't ask how I spent my night) from Meri Surat Teri Aankhen; Ek chatur naar (A clever woman) from Padosan; and Eey bhai zara dekh ke chalo (Oh brother, look where you're going) from Meraa Naam Joker. He also sang for Bollywood super-hits Sholay and Amar Akbar Anthony. In the last few years, he had largely withdrawn from public life. Dey's peers from Bollywood and fans took to Twitter to pay tribute to the singer. "Today, great classical singer Manna Dey sahab, who we fondly called Manna da, is not among us anymore. He had a very pleasant and easy personality. He was very dedicated to his work. I salute him and pray that his soul rests in peace," singer Lata Mangeshkar, who collaborated on innumerable hits with him, wrote on Twitter. Mangeshkar's duet Pyar hua ikraar hua (I admit I'm in love), played as background to film of actors Raj Kapoor and Nargis on a rainy night under an umbrella in Shri 420, is among the most popular romantic songs of Bollywood. "Manna Dey, stalwart of the music world, passes away. Flooded with memories and his songs," tweeted Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan. In another tweet, Bachchan said: "Strange how we connect events of our life with his songs." "Manna Dey passes away. His voice shall linger forever. RIP," tweeted film-maker Mahesh Bhat. Actor Manoj Bajpai tweeted: "Manna Dey is no more! A great singer! Let's pray for him! My condolences to his family! His music will live for 1000 yrs. RIP." Actress Shabana Azmi wrote: "Manna Dey had a unique voice. He will live on through his songs Ai Meri Zohra Jabeen/ dil ka haal suney dilwala/ poocho na kaise maine. RIP." Popular cricket commentator Harsha Bhogle tweeted. "Oh no. Such terrible news to get up to. Manna Dey no more? Less melody in the world." Dey, a Bengali, also charmed neighbouring Bangladesh with songs in his mother tongue and in a message on Thursday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said Dey would remain alive forever among music-loving people of the subcontinent. "People will never forget his extraordinary melodious voice and unique style," she said. </body>

      <body>Singer Noel Harrison has died at his home in Devon, aged 79. The son of the actor Rex Harrison, he was best known for recording the hit song The Windmills Of Your Mind on The Thomas Crown Affair soundtrack. It won best song at the 1968 Oscars and was later covered by artists including Dusty Springfield. Harrison spent much of his life in America, as an actor and performer, but moved back to the UK in the last decade or so to live in South Devon. He once said, of recording The Windmills Of Your Mind: "It didn't seem like a big deal at the time. I went to the studio one afternoon and sang it and pretty much forgot about it." Harrison continued: "I didn't realise until later what a timeless, beautiful piece Michel LeGrand and the Bergmans had written. It turned out to be my most notable piece of work." After moving to the US, he starred in the TV series The Girl from UNCLE and had chart hits with A Young Girl and Suzanne, by Leonard Cohen. On his website he wrote: "I was part of the 'British Invasion' spearheaded by The Beatles. I bought a nice house in Los Angeles. "There was another US charts record and four years of endless TV appearances, theatre tours and star-studded social occasions." However he revealed he "didn't like being a celebrity" and spent his sixties mixing performing with construction work before moving back to the UK, adding, "I was well out of the goldfish bowl and I liked it." Harrison was born in London on 29 January 1934, to Rex Harrison and his mother, Collette Thomas, the first of six Mrs Rex Harrisons. They later divorced and he lived in Bude, Cornwall, with his mother's parents before she took him to live in the Swiss Alps at 15. Harrison never went to school again but indulged his passion for ski-racing instead, becoming British champion in 1953. He was married three times and had children and grandchildren from his first two marriages. An admirer of Jacques Brel, Harrison created a one-man musical, Adieu, Jacques in the 1980s and, in 2002, released an album of songs from the show. Harrison played Glastonbury Festival's Spirit of '71 stage in 2011, marking 40 years since his first appearance at the festival. </body>

The 29-year-old breakfast DJ now has one million fewer listeners than his predecessor Chris Moyles, according to the figures from research body Rajar. With 5.58m listeners a week, the breakfast show is suffering its lowest audience for a decade, easily beaten by the morning shows on Radios 2 and 4. Grimshaw took over from Moyles in 2012, in a bid to attract younger listeners. Radio 1 controller Ben Cooper said: "After the biggest set of changes to Radio 1 for a generation, we're really happy that the breakfast show sounds fresher, younger and more vibrant than ever and as a result 833,000 of the show's 'over-30s' listeners have moved on to other stations." Chris Evans appears to be the main beneficiary, attracting 9.34 million weekly listeners, while Radio 4's flagship Today show draws 6.8 million listeners. Evans' figures were up 800,000 on the same period last year, re-affirming his status as the UK's most popular breakfast DJ. Grimshaw, by comparison, has lost 305,000 listeners in the three months to 24 October - with audiences falling by 17% on the same quarter in 2012. He now trails Evans by 3.8 million listeners, a dramatic change from four years ago, when the breakfast shows for the two stations were almost neck and neck. Radio 1's breakfast show is now close to its record lowest audience of 5.5 million, recorded by Sara Cox in the last three months of her tenure, in 2003. Radio 2 continues to have the UK's biggest audience with 14.9 million listeners each week, up a million in a year. Radio 1 has 10.83 million listeners, marginally behind Radio 4's 10.87 million. "Radio 2 is a remarkable success story and continues to reach huge audiences whilst never failing to surprise and amaze with the diversity of its output," said Radio 2 controller Helen Boaden. Radio 3's total listener numbers rose 1.5% to just over 2 million, during a period that included its annual coverage of the Proms, while BBC 6 Music's listenership was up 6.9% year on year - despite a dip of 3.4% on the previous quarter. BBC Radio 5 Live grew its audience to 6.12 million, rising 0.5% year on year, while digital sister station Radio 5 Live Sports Extra attracted a record 1.52 million listeners following its coverage of England's Ashes victory this summer. BBC's Asian Network fell by 5% over the year, averaging 555,000 listeners each week. </body>

      <title>Bake Off final gets BBC Two record</title>
      <description>BBC Two scores its biggest audience in a decade as judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood crowned the winner of the fourth series of The Great British Bake Off.</description>

      <body>The Great British Bake Off is BBC Two's most-watched programme in a decade, after an average 8.4 million viewers saw Frances Quinn win series four. Clothes designer Quinn, 31, said she was "in complete and utter shock" after beating psychologist Kimberley Wilson and former model Ruby Tandoh. She impressed judges Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood with her wedding cake, inspired by A Midsummer Night's Dream. At its peak, some 9.1 million people tuned in to Tuesday night's finale. The episode - which also saw the amateur bakers making pretzels and picnic pie - secured double the audience tuning into the Uefa Champions League football match which was broadcast on ITV at the same time. The hit show, which moves to BBC One next series, beat the record held by a 2007 episode of Top Gear, by more than 400,000 viewers. Bake Off presenters Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins had billed Quinn, who lives in Market Harborough, Leicestershire, as "the most creative baker to ever set foot in the tent". She said she was looking forward to celebrating with family and friends, after having to keep her win under wraps since recording the final episode during the summer. "I've been back at work and trying to keep a poker face," said Quinn. "I remember watching the Wimbledon final the following week and getting so emotional... and thinking at least Andy Murray doesn't have to hide his trophy under his bed for the next three months." Quinn said she was shocked to hear her name: "I don't think I could speak for a little while. It was so close, such a close final," she said. However she insisted there was no antagonism between the all-female finalists. "We all get on. People want to feel there was more competition than was the case," she said. "The emotions you go through in that tent - you never want to see anyone get that criticism. Outside the tent we're just supportive of each other." Hollywood called Quinn "a deserving winner", who beat the others "hands down" in the showstopper round. "She not only gave us the style, she gave us the substance too and that cake actually, each layer, superb," he said. Fellow judge Berry added: "She has attention to detail, she's got excellent flavours, her baking improved as each week went by. We're very proud of her." Quinn said she was not thinking of leaving her design job, although she has already been approached by agents and hopes to produce a book. "Work has been so, so supportive. I'm not going to say yay or nay to anything at the moment, I've got a mortgage to pay," she said. "The baking market is completely saturated so I don't want to do a book that's anything like one that's already out there. I'd like to create a book that's got all my rough sketches and ideas." "I don't know what the future is going to hold but it does excite me. What I'd love to do is combine both passions, baking and design." Meanwhile runner-up Tandoh, 21, has hit back at the "nastiness" the show and its contestants were subjected to, in a piece written for The Guardian. "Despite the saccharin sweetness of the Bake Off, an extraordinary amount of bitterness and bile has spewed forth every week from angry commentators, both on social media and in the press," she wrote. "Many took to Twitter decrying the demise of the show, voicing their hatred for certain bakers, and asserting (week after week!) that they would 'never watch it again' if X or Y got through that episode." The amateur baker - who recently received a first class honours degree in philosophy - said the criticism ranged from "gently cynical" to "downright obnoxious", and as the series went on she noticed "an increasing amount of personal vitriol and misogyny". Tandoh, who chef Raymond Blanc suggested was too thin to enjoy food, said she was "tired" of defending herself against the "boring, inevitable accusations of flirting with Paul Hollywood, of emotionally manipulating the judges and of somehow surfing into the final on a tidal wave of tears". She added: "So much of the criticism levelled at the bakers is gender-specific. My self-doubt has been simultaneously labelled pathetic, fake, attention-seeking and manipulative." </body>

      <body>The Metropolitan Police Service will be the subject of a BBC One documentary series that will go behind the scenes at Britain's largest police force. Channel controller Charlotte Moore said The Met would be the first "definitive" look at the "vital" organisation. Over six hour-long episodes, she said the public would see the police force "in a way never seen before". Met commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he was "delighted" to work with the BBC "on such an important project". "I hope that over the coming months, we can reveal the true scale and complexity of the challenges faced by officers and staff across the service." According to the BBC, the show will "take an in-depth look at how the Metropolitan Police Service works" and "show the scale and complexity of policing London on a day-to-day basis". "We have been granted extraordinary, unprecedented access to film from top to bottom of the organisation," said Moore, who nurtured the series in her previous role as commissioning editor for documentaries. The BBC One announcement coincides with news from BBC Three about five new factual and current affairs series. These include Slum Survivors, a three-part series that tests young people's resourcefulness in the slums of Lagos, Mumbai and Jakarta, and The Human Tissue Team, a two-part look at tissue donation. </body>

      <title>Corden on singing like Paul Potts</title>
      <description>James Corden on becoming Paul Potts</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24565984</url>
      <date>1382686951</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70690000/jpg/_70690011_cordenfilmshot.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the microphone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it, seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <title>Liz West: An artist with extra Spice</title>
      <description>How a Spice Girls obsession helped an art career</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24655947</url>
      <date>1382660897</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70687000/jpg/_70687979_liz2.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Artist Liz West is gaining a glowing reputation for her colour-drenched light installations - but her art career might not have taken off if it were not for her world-record collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. Art and pop can go hand-in-hand, she explains. West is taking part in two exhibitions this week - one featuring her strips of coloured light radiating from the corner of an old warehouse, which is in the Synthesis exhibition as part of Manchester Science Festival. She has a growing reputation as a contemporary artist thanks to her arrangements of lights in precise, pleasing patterns and her collections of objects bathed in bright, bold hues. For the other exhibition, she has lent some of the 5,000 Spice Girls items she has amassed since the age of 11, including branded clothes, crisp packets and a clock, to an exhibition celebrating 40 years of Virgin Records in London. As well as being an artist, West holds the Guinness World Record for the largest collection of Spice Girls memorabilia. "The way I see it is that installation art is high culture and Spice Girls is pop culture," she says. "Although the two hold hands, they're separate." When looking to launch her art career, West's Spice Girls obsession came in useful when she found she could get paid for loaning her girl-powered pop collection to museums, film crews and events. "Because I was given that financial boost to start with, my art practice has been able to roll and roll," she says. "Now I'm able to fund my art practice through my art. I don't have to work in Starbucks part-time. A lot of artists do have to work part-time, and I think that would kill any creativity for me. It really would." West was born into the art world - almost literally - almost born on the floor of the Whitworth Gallery in Manchester, she says, when her mother Jenny was artist in residence there 28 years ago. A five-day-old West attended the opening of her mother's exhibition. When she was seven years old, West remembers putting nail varnish bottles on a bedroom shelf in line according to their colour. It is not difficult to spot a link between her love of colour as a child and the artworks she now creates. Then when she was 11, the Spice Girls arrived. "A very impressionable age, I think," she says. "I was hooked. The colour, the energy, the different personalities. That appealed - more so probably than the music." When the Spice Girls' second album came out in 1997, West decided to collect any and every recording and item of memorabilia she could get her hands on. "I'd go to the pound shop and buy bags of things as a 13- or 14-year-old. They brought out the dolls and I went to London to the Hamleys sale. "Of course, when eBay appeared when I was 18, I had a student loan, went a bit mad, and it just continued." Influenced by her parents (her father Steve is also an artist), West attended the prestigious Glasgow School of Art. "When I was a student, I'd go into the studio all day and then I'd go into the library in the evening and just bid and bid and bid [on eBay]," she says. "I'd have a day of art and an evening of Spice." West says she has spent "tens of thousands" of pounds on her collection, which also includes outfits from the Brit Awards, the Spiceworld movie and the jacket Mel B wore to meet Nelson Mandela. But it does not include the most iconic Spice outfit of them all - Geri Halliwell's union jack dress from the 1997 Brit Awards. That was bought by the Hard Rock Cafe in Las Vegas for £41,000. "That's the holy grail," West says. "And it's in storage. That's quite upsetting." Now, West's art career is taking off thanks to her luminous installations that look like she has dismantled and rearranged a rainbow. "Did you see the rainbow the other day over Manchester?" she says excitedly at the mention of rainbows. "This was a double one and it was a proper arch. I stopped in the street for about five minutes and stared at it. "I thought, forget James Turrell and Olafur Eliasson and all the artists that I absolutely love - this is true absolute beauty. There's something in that that I could never create, even if I tried." West says she is not worried about her Spice Girls obsession undermining her reputation as an artist. "It's completely in keeping with my personality," she says. "And because I've got such a passion for it, I win people over with that passion. It's not just about T-shirts and dollies. "As a serious artist, this is my career. I want to be nominated for the Turner Prize. "If you look at other artists, there are quite a few that have quirky collections out there and haven't hidden them. I don't have a problem with it." What do other artists say when they find out about the collection? "They think it's quite funny," West replies. "You know, it would be really boring if I didn't do anything else. People tend to think that it's a quirk, and quite a nice one." </body>

      <body>Colin Hambrook is a poet and visual artist with mental health difficulties and ME. He runs Disability Arts Online (DAO) a web portal for disabled artists which reviews and showcases their work. In Hambrook's latest autobiographical project, Knitting Time, he recalls being brought up by a Jehovah's Witness mother who was mentally ill. She, Hambrook and the other Jehovah's Witnesses they knew, believed that the world was due to end in 1975. This collection of illustrated poetry, and the accompanying art exhibition, explore the psychosis and grief he experienced as a result. Why did you call it Knitting Time? Knitting time is an allegory for psychosis. What that does to you is bring you to a place where time is distended. Brain functions, like memory and cognition, can get distorted and it becomes very difficult to believe what's going on in your head. The idea of Knitting Time was to try and encapsulate that sense of bringing yourself back into reality. What's it about? The story that unfolds through the poetry and artwork is that of my mother. She was sectioned in the late 60s, early 70s and knitting was one of the key activities that "mental patients" were given to keep their hands busy. Once they had finished, the knitting was ripped apart and the wool re-used. My mother's psychosis got worse as time went on and knitting became a key part of her world. She was knitting new universes, places of safety we could go to when the world ended. What was it like to believe that the world would end before you'd reached adulthood? I was a very serious little boy and took the Jehovah's Witnesses seriously. It was frightening to be brought up in this belief and to realise I had to do my best to be perfect, so that I'd be among the chosen ones when the end came. Everything went wrong quite a few years before 1975 though. When my mother was sectioned, we were thrown out of the faith. We were led to believe that only families who had a strong patriarch at their helm were eligible to be chosen but dad refused to have anything to do with the Jehovah's Witnesses, So we felt we were damned anyway. You were 16 in 1975. Did you still believe the end was imminent? By 1975, I had largely come to realise that it was all rubbish. All about money, power and religious oppression. But there was still a part of me that was keyed in to those beliefs. How did you feel when the end never came? My feelings were mixed. What had happened to my mother in the mental health system left me very depressed, so a big part of me was looking forward to it all ending. I didn't move forward easily. I became very lost and pretty mentally ill and stayed in that state for most of my twenties. There's part of me that's never quite come to terms with the fact that the world didn't end in 1975. Knitting Time's main theme is psychosis. What's your personal experience of this? I don't think psychosis is necessarily a bad thing. It's common for toddlers to have imaginary friends and night visions, to see things that aren't there. I had that facility to a greater degree than most. I remember vividly seeing things at night time like a lion treading up the stairs or a man dressed in an archetypal burglar outfit, swag-bag on back. Did your psychotic episodes change when you became an adult? This capacity for hallucination has come and gone throughout my life. A large part of me realised early on that it was my mind playing tricks. If I haven't slept and my nervous system is distended, it is likely that the psychotic episode will be unpleasant. But if I can relax into it and find space to let it be, then it can be interesting. When I was nine or 10, an angel exuding white light stayed with me all night. That was very beautiful. What was your motivation for producing work about psychosis? People's prejudice around psychosis is down to a fear of those kinds of experiences, because people don't understand it and people don't talk about it. One of my main motivations for doing this project was to try and have a conversation about something people see as very dark and very difficult. The other big theme of Knitting Time is grief. Why? After my mum had electric shock therapy, she temporarily lost all memory of her children. It was like she'd died, the person we knew before never came back. During my pre-teen and teenage years, I went through a process of mourning. A lot of my psychosis was in response to the grief I felt. I read a book by Joan Didion about the years following her husband's death, when she went through a psychosis related to her grief. It brought home to me my own experiences as a child. The poetry I wrote for Knitting Time is a reflection on that part of my life and how, like Joan, I came through it with the help of family and friends. Knitting time is published by Waterloo Press. The art exhibition which accompanies the book is at the Pallant House Gallery until 3 November.

      <title>John Carpenter reflects on Halloween</title>
      <description>John Carpenter reflects on hit horror Halloween as it turns 35</description>

      <body>In 1978, a low-budget film about a masked killer stalking a young babysitter in a quiet Illinois suburb took the film industry by storm. Filmed for just over $300,000 (about $1m today), John Carpenter's Halloween has since made more than $47m. Cinema audiences were terrified and delighted in equal amount and Michael Myers, with his battered white facemask became a pop culture icon, preceding the likes of Jason Voorhees, the hockey-masked brute from the Friday the 13th films and Freddie Krueger of the Nightmare on Elm Street franchise. "I can believe it," says the now 65-year-old semi-retired director, about the span of time since he created one of the ultimate movie monsters. "I'm old now, 35 years ago I was a young kid then just trying to make a movie but some part of me still feels like that young kid." Prior to Halloween, Carpenter had already known some success with the exploitation film Assault on Precinct 13 which, although a flop in the US, had enjoyed some resurgence in Europe after being screened at the London Film Festival in 1977. He was called to a meeting in London with producer Irwin Yablans and Syrian financier Moustapha Akkad who wanted a film which, Carpenter says, "was originally to be called The Babysitter Murders". "The idea was that every American girl can relate to that." After persuading Akkad to part with the money and cede full creative control to Carpenter and his writing partner Debra Hill, work began on the script for Halloween. Carpenter even composed the music for the film, its tinkling piano and doom-laden chords powering it on to become one of horror's most recognisable and enduring film themes. "The biggest memory I have in a way was how easy it was," says the director. "I had a few features under my belt so I was really rolling in terms of the physical problems of shooting a movie, just how to get through it. And I had the movie figured out and it was a lot of fun." Although the idea of a stalking killer was not a new one, having been seen in films like Michael Powell's voyeuristic Peeping Tom; Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola's Dementia 13 and even Tobe Hooper's creation Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween's Myers was a different beast. "We had this idea of Michael Myers being not quite a human but almost a supernatural force," says Carpenter. "Evil as a force of nature in the personification of this man. "So we put him in a mask so he wouldn't have human features." The two-dollar rubber mask was a likeness of Star Trek actor William Shatner, sprayed a bluish-white - and it terrified people. "The best compliment I got was standing outside a theatre and hearing the audience scream, that was just delightful." Halloween ushered in the era of the slasher movies of the 1980s. Though they were not the first, it - along with Friday 13th - brought the previously niche horror genre hurtling into the mainstream. Carpenter, however, plays down his reputation as the father of the genre: "I think the main reason that Halloween inspired other movies was very shrewd producers looking and saying, 'This idiot made this for $300,000, we can do it and make money'. "It's all about making money in Hollywood. It wasn't about art." The slasher genre now looks relatively timid when compared with the explosion in what became known as the "torture porn" of the 2000s. Super-violent films such as Hostel and the Saw franchise undoubtedly built on the brutal nature of films like Halloween and Friday the 13th. Since then, filmmakers have returned to the basics with ghost films like The Conjuring and The Woman In Black, which have proved to be a massive draw at the box office. But Carpenter - who has dabbled in ghostly tales such as The Fog and Christine - again insists: "Horror films have been around since the beginning of cinema and each one leads to another so they continue to morph and change depending on society. "None of this is new, there have always been ghost stories. There are just new ways of telling stories." Though horror makes up the main body of Carpenter's work, the director has branched out into other genres such as the comedy-action of Big Trouble in Little China and the romance of Starman - which earned Jeff Bridges an Oscar nomination. His influence on a younger generation of filmmakers can been seen, in particular in the work of Danish director Nicholas Winding Refn of Drive fame. In a recent BBC interview, he voiced his love for Carpenter's 1981 film Escape from New York - starring Kurt Russell as the anti-hero Cyclops Snake Plissken whose mission is to rescue the US president from the Big Apple - now a maximum security prison. "God, I loved that movie," said Refn. "It's perfect cinema, a perfect soundtrack. That pulsey beat." Carpenter, roaring with laughter, is clearly delighted with the compliment: "Hell yes," he cackles. "Who wouldn't be?" If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery then Carpenter is blessed indeed, for alongside the seven sequels to Halloween, no fewer than four of his films have been remade in recent years, with an adaptation of Escape from New York long rumoured. British actors Jason Statham and Tom Hardy are believed to be front-runners to take over the role of Plissken. "I'm mostly extremely excited, especially when they have to pay me money," says Carpenter. "I made my films and the remakes are the remakes, so its fine with me." After 43 years in the film business, Carpenter is now semi-retired but offers a word of advice to young filmmakers. "The biggest challenge is surviving the movie business and making films despite all the obstacles in your way," he says. "Nobody tells you how to survive. "I don't know if I'm as hungry as I was. I'm not as driven as I was, my entire life's goal was to become a professional director and I did that, I've nothing left to prove to myself." A 35th anniversary edition of Halloween is out on 21 October. </body>

      <title>Tinie Tempah: 'I believe in the magic of music'</title>
      <description>Tinie Tempah on celebrity, success and self-awareness</description>

      <body>Brit Award-winning UK rapper Tinie Tempah tells how Adele helped him pick the songs for his new album - and why his old school might not like it. Tinie Tempah has no eyes on the cover of his new album. They've been scratched out, painted over. And deliberately so. "I'm trying to make it about the music again," he explains. "It felt like I was starting to become a personality. People were starting to know me for lots of other things, which is cool, but I just want it to be about the music. "Don't look at the eyes, listen to the voice, hear what I'm saying." Coming to terms with fame is a recurring theme of the star's second album, called Demonstration. "Tell me, doctor, am I fit for all these flashing lights?" he asks on Children of The Sun. On Looking Down The Barrel, the rapper admits: "When I'm near the public for too long, I act fidgety." "You can definitely hear me battling to hold onto that sense of normality and reality, as opposed to being thrown into this mad world of celebrity," says the 24-year-old. The success of his Mercury-nominated debut made Tinie a tabloid fixture - linked with Rihanna and Nicole Scherzinger in the gossip columns. But thankfully his new album isn't an awful "tears of a pop star" sobfest about empty hotel rooms and emptier relationships. Instead, he lists his distractions - New York fashion week, partying in Las Vegas - before admonishing himself: "Oy oy, mate, don't sell out!" "The most important thing is self-awareness," he says - but witty lyrics help, too. He writes, on the Daft Punk-referencing Lover Not A Fighter - about meeting his old teacher, who declares herself a fan and tries (successfully) "to get in my jeans". Is it a true story? "It's not directly literal," he laughs. "Without sounding un-gentlemanly, it may not necessarily have been 'my teacher', but it could have been 'a teacher.'" Nonetheless, he's keen to find out how the song is received in his old school staff room. "It's going to be like a game of Cluedo! They're going to be looking around - 'was it you?'" Born Patrick Chukwuemeka Okogwu, Tinie Tempah grew up in the notorious, now-condemned Aylesbury estate in Peckham. His parents had come to the UK from Nigeria in their 20s. His father, a barber, retrained as a social worker and his mother worked as a human resources officer. By the time Tinie was 12, they had saved enough money to move to Plumstead - a short walk from the O2 Arena, which he headlines in December. The youngster picked up his parents' work ethic, gaining A-Levels in media studies, religious studies and psychology. But his life changed when he saw the music video for So Solid Crew's 21 Seconds: Rap, he suddenly realised, didn't have to come from the other side of the Atlantic. He took a job selling double-glazing to fund his first music video, and was being played on radio stations like KISS and BBC Radio 1Xtra before he signed a record deal with Parlophone in 2009. Five of the singles from his first album, Disc-Overy, hit the UK top 20 - while the inspirational, rap-rock crossover Written In The Stars made him a star in America, too. But the follow-up was delayed while his record label Parlophone changed hands, as part of the huge Universal-EMI merger. "There was a holding period where I could release the album in England, but I wouldn't have been able to release it in the rest of the world," says the musician. "It was a mad, compromising time. I remember Coldplay had just brought out their album and Chris Martin said to me, 'everyone who got out their album at the start of the year was lucky because there's going to have to be a long wait.'" Tinie filled the time writing new songs, and releasing others for free online. "I've realised more and more you need to get your ideas out," he says. "Unless you know you've made another Heal The World, I don't think you should hold on to music. "If you empty your tank it'll refill again." Forever attired in a tailored jacket, dark blue denim and his trademark, thick-rimmed spectacles, Tinie was named Britain's best-dressed man by GQ Magazine two years ago. He told the editors he maintained a sharp appearance because "it would be weird if I was wearing exactly what someone in the crowd was wearing. What would set me aside from them?" But off-stage, he is determined to stay grounded. His cousin is his manager, he's constantly in touch with his mum, and everyone has the right to put him in his place. "I don't consider myself a crazy person, so if I do get a good telling-off, I usually know it's for something worthwhile," he says. He's coy about his transgressions, though - admitting only that he gets carried away in clothes shops. "People will say, 'you're never going to wear that, you're getting excited,'" he laughs. "I'm not off the rails... yet, anyway." However, he can't help referencing his new-found wealth on his record. Lines like "I'm putting on the pounds but I ain't gaining weight" permeate the new album - but does he worry that bragging about success will alienate fans? "I definitely do think that," he says, "but all these things are happening to me and you can't not say it. "You know when you've put a lot of water in a balloon, and it's getting bigger and bigger? Sometimes I just want to burst with excitement - and where else should I say that, if not in my music?" He hopes the lyrics give fans something to aspire to - the same way So Solid Crew inspired him. "I always feel an obligation to anybody who's trying to be like me," he says. "I'm a British musician and I'm very much in pop culture - but I have come from grime, a genre of music which is still very niche, and is still very underground." "Given where I've come from, there's an obligation to say, 'you know what? The world is a big place, and the moment I left here and applied myself, great things happened.'" He certainly moves in high circles. He got feedback on the new album from Coldplay's Chris Martin, while Adele advised him on the track list. He's also been picking up tips in Hollywood. "I was lucky enough to go to Jennifer Lopez's house [and] she basically said to me that anybody at the top of their game is constantly still studying their craft. "She gave me an example of the fact that Will Smith, whenever he shoots a movie, still has his acting coach on the other side of the camera. "Even though he's at the top of his game, he still wants to learn. It's such a humbling thing for me, you know, so that was a really good bit of advice." Unsurprisingly, his ambitions are global: Hearing Beyonce sing Irreplaceable in Spanish (Irreempazable) made him realise that success wasn't just determined by breaking America. "Playing in Kuala Lumpur or Sri Lanka is just as good a feeling as playing in America," he says. "It's just about being as big an artist as I can be. "I believe in the magic of music. Hopefully one day I'll make the right song, or the right album, that will impact the whole world." Tinie Tempah releases the single Children of the Sun on Monday, 28 October. His album, Demonstration follows on 4 November. </body>
