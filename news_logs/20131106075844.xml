      <body>A series of small blasts have killed at least one person outside a provincial office of the ruling Communist Party in northern China, state media report. The blasts in Taiyuan in Shanxi province appeared to have been caused by home-made bombs, Xinhua reported. It said eight people had been injured and two cars damaged. Photos posted on social media showed smoke and several fire engines at the scene of the incident, which happened around 07:40 local time (23:40 GMT). No immediate explanation has been given for the incident. There have been occasions in the past where disgruntled citizens have targeted local government institutions. Tensions are also high in the wake of last week's incident in Beijing. A car ploughed into a crowd in Tiananmen Square in what the authorities said was a terrorist attack incited by extremists from the western region of Xinjiang. Later this week, the Communist Party's top officials will meet in Beijing to start a major economic planning meeting. "Several small explosive devices went off at Taiyuan's Yingze Street near the provincial party office," Shanxi police said in a post on their verified microblog. "Provincial leaders went to the scene immediately, and police are currently investigating the case," the post added. "Police officers found steel balls, circuit boards and similar explosive materials at the scene," state-run news agency Xinhua said. "The initial judgement is that the explosions were man-made." The explosive devices were hidden in roadside flower beds, according to Chinese state television. However, two witnesses told Xinhua they saw a minivan exploding, sending car debris flying. Eyewitnesses also told Xinhua they heard "seven loud blasts", and saw a large amount of smoke at the site. Photos posted on microblog Sina Weibo appeared to show cars windows and tyres that were damaged as a result of the blasts, as well as metal ball-bearings. One of those injured was in a serious condition, state media said. Taiyuan police said in a verified microblog post that two-way traffic was restored on Yingze Street at 10:30 local time (02:30 GMT). Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi, a province in north central China home to large-scale coal mining, is home to more than four million people.

      <title>Democrats win NYC and Virginia polls</title>
      <description>Democrats win key elections in New York City and the state of Virginia, in the first major round of polls since President Obama's re-election in 2012.</description>

      <body>Democrats have won key elections in New York City and the state of Virginia, in the first major round of polls since President Obama's re-election in 2012. With almost all votes counted, Bill de Blasio will succeed Mayor Michael Bloomberg to become the first Democrat leading New York City in two decades. In Virginia, Terry McAuliffe beat Republican Ken Cuccinelli in a very close race for the governor's seat. Republican Chris Christie was easily re-elected governor of New Jersey. Tuesday's races are seen as an early test of both parties' strengths ahead of next year's congressional mid-term elections. With 99% of votes counted in New York, Mr de Blasio secured 73% of the vote, convincingly defeating his Republican rival Joe Lhota, who polled 24%. In his victory speech, Mr de Blasio said the poll showed that America's largest city had chosen "a progressive path", and he promised to make fighting income inequality his top priority. He is the city's first Democratic mayor since 1993. He ran Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign, and is seen as one of the most liberal politicians to run for mayor in decades. Mr Lhota admitted defeat, saying the race had been a good fight and a fight worth having. He ran the city's public transport authority under Mayor Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent, and also worked in the administration of Rudolph Giuliani. Last year, Mr Lhota was lauded for quickly getting the vast subway system running again after a huge storm, Sandy, flooded swathes of the city. In Virginia, Mr McAuliffe won an extremely tight race, defeating Mr Cuccinelli. With results in from 99.7% of precincts, Mr McAuliffe polled 47% to his opponent's 45%. Mr McAuliffe is a businessman and veteran Democratic party fundraiser. He has close ties to former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, serving as chairman of her 2008 presidential campaign. Mr Cuccinelli, the Virginia attorney general, has angled for the support of the hardcore conservative Tea Party movement of Republicans. Mr McAuliffe, who has raised much more money, has sought to link Mr Cuccinelli to last month's partial shutdown of the federal government, which was brought about by Republicans in Washington DC. Virginia, long a Republican stronghold, has seen a demographic shift in recent years. Mr Obama, a Democrat, won the state in the last two presidential elections. In New Jersey, Mr Christie was declared the unofficial winner by the US media just minutes after the polls closed. "Thank you, New Jersey, for making me the luckiest guy in the world," he told supporters after his victory. Mr Christie won 60.5% of the vote, against 38% for Ms Buono, with 99% of precincts reporting. Analysts say Mr Christie's popularity with voters in Democratic-leaning New Jersey makes him a contender for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, because it could enable him to claim broad political appeal. Mr Christie was already a popular figure when Superstorm Sandy devastated the state's coastline a year ago. His response to the storm attracted national attention. While many in New Jersey support Mrs Buono's positions, she has had difficulty raising money, even from Democrats, because of her relatively low profile. The results of Tuesday's polls could prove an early measure of the parties' support ahead of the midterm elections of 2014, which will decide the make-up of the House of Representatives, one-third of the Senate, and the governorships in more than half the states. In Washington, Mr Obama's Democratic party controls the Senate, while the Republicans hold sway in the House of Representatives. Now in his second term, Mr Obama will vacate the presidency in 2017. </body>

      <description>Apple reveals details of requests it has received from governments across the globe to share customer data.</description>

      <body>Apple has revealed details of requests it has received from governments across the globe to share customer data. The US government, which made between 1,000 and 2,000 requests in the six months to 30 June, topped the list. The firm said the US requests affected 2,000 to 3,000 accounts, adding it gave out data on zero to 1,000 accounts. Apple said the most common "requests involve robberies and other crimes or requests from law enforcement officers searching for missing persons". It said the response usually involves disclosing information about an account holder's iTunes or iCloud account "such as a name and an address". "In very rare cases, we are asked to provide stored photos or email. We consider these requests very carefully and only provide account content in extremely limited circumstances," the firm said. The UK was second on the list, with 127 requests. Spain, Germany and Australia also featured in the top five. The tech giant added that since its main business was "not about collecting information", the vast majority of requests it received from law enforcement agencies were about information on "lost or stolen devices". The company logs these requests under a separate category as "device requests" which, it said, "never include national security-related requests". Apple received more than 3,500 such requests in the US between January and June this year. Apple also used the report to call for more freedom to disclose the details of such requests to customers. It said that currently the US government did not allow it to disclose "except in broad ranges, the number of national security orders, the number of accounts affected by the orders, or whether content, such as emails, was disclosed". "We strongly oppose this gag order," it added. It said it had asked the government to ease these restrictions but so far had not seen any major changes. "Despite our extensive efforts in this area, we do not yet have an agreement that we feel adequately addresses our customers' right to know how often and under what circumstances we provide data to law enforcement agencies". Earlier this year, Google, Facebook and Microsoft asked the US government to allow them to disclose the security requests they receive to hand over user data. The move by these companies came after leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed mass surveillance programmes by the National Security Agency (NSA) and associated agencies. Apple said it had filed a letter with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court supporting a group of cases requesting greater transparency. "We will continue to aggressively pursue our ability to be more transparent." </body>

      <body>Israel's former Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman has been cleared of corruption charges by a court in Jerusalem. Mr Lieberman, a key ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, could now return to his post as head of the foreign ministry. The charges related to his alleged involvement in the promotion of Israel's former ambassador to Belarus. A guilty verdict had threatened to shake up Israel's ruling coalition. Mr Lieberman, who stepped down after the charges were filed, heads the right-wing Yisrael Beitenu party. His party ran on a list with Likud which narrowly won general elections in January. He had denied charges of fraud and breach of trust and told reporters after the verdict: "This chapter is behind me." </body>

      <title>Toyota raises yearly profit forecast</title>
      <description>The world's biggest carmaker, Toyota, raises its profit forecast as the yen's weakness and cost cutting measures help lift its earnings.</description>

      <body>The world's biggest carmaker, Toyota, has raised its profit forecast as the yen's weakness and cost-cutting measures helped lift its earnings. It now expects to make a net profit of 1.67tn yen ($16.9bn; £10.5bn) in the financial year to 31 March 2014, up from an earlier forecast of 1.48tn yen. Toyota upped the forecast as it reported a net profit of 1tn yen for the six months to the end of September. The results are in contrast with Nissan which cut its profit outlook last week. Toyota said it expects to sell 9.1 million vehicles in the current financial year and generate a revenue of 25tn yen during the period. Japanese carmakers, including Toyota, rely heavily on sales in foreign markets. As a result, any fluctuation in the currency markets has an impact on their profitability. Over the past year Japanese carmakers have benefited from the decline in the yen's value - which makes their cars more affordable for foreign buyers and also boosts their profits when they repatriate their foreign earnings back home. The Japanese currency had fallen nearly 25% against the US dollar since November last year after the new government unveiled a series of aggressive policies aimed at spurring Japan's economy. Toyota said the fluctuation on the currency resulted in an increase of 540bn yen in its operating profit during the April-to-September period. It made an operating profit of 1.25tn yen during the period compared with 694bn yen last year. "In addition to the impact of the weaker yen, operating income increased due to our efforts with our suppliers and distributors for profit improvement through cost reduction and marketing activities, such as enhancement of the model mix," said Nobuyori Kodaira, an executive vice president with Toyota. Toyota has staged a remarkable recovery over the past two years after its business was impacted by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011. It has since reclaimed the top spot as the world's biggest carmaker from US rival General Motors. Its sales in the US - its biggest market - have also been on the rise, helped in part by an overall recovery in the US car market. But a spate of recalls have hampered its recovery. Toyota has called back more than 20 million vehicles over the past two years for a variety of problems. The recalls have been mostly voluntary, and there have been no major crashes involved, but analysts have warned of their negative impact on Toyota's reputation. </body>

      <body>An Australian man who spent five years in Guantanamo Bay before admitting terrorism offences has filed an appeal against his conviction. David Hicks pleaded guilty to providing material support for terrorism in 2007 as part of a deal that saw him repatriated and later freed. His US-based lawyers now want to see his conviction overturned. They are arguing that a ruling in another case that struck down similar charges should be applied to Hicks. They also say that agreeing to admit the charges was the only way he could secure his release. Hick's lawyers are seeking to apply a ruling in the case of Osama Bin Laden's former driver and bodyguard, Salim Hamdan, to his case. An appeals court ruled last year that providing material support for terrorism was not recognised as a war crime when Hamdan was in Afghanistan. Both he and Hicks were prosecuted under a law enacted in 2006 and applied retroactively - something the court subsequently ruled could not be done. "Years after Hicks was convicted and served his sentence, a federal court has concluded that the process by which he was convicted was unlawful," said Wells Dixon of the Centre for Constitutional Rights, which is representing Hicks. He also said that Hicks saw a guilty plea as his only option. "He literally had no choice under those circumstances,'' he said. "It was either plead guilty or follow through with his plan to commit suicide.'' The appeal was filed on Tuesday with the US Court of Military Commission Review. A Pentagon spokesman said Hicks had waived his right to appeal as part of the plea deal - but Hicks' lawyers say the paperwork was improperly filed. David Hicks, a convert to Islam who later renounced the faith, was captured with Taleban forces in Afghanistan in 2001. He admitted attending paramilitary training camps in Afghanistan, but argued he did not believe they were linked to terrorism. He is now living in Australia, after being released from prison in December 2007. </body>

      <title>Kerry aims to rescue Mid-East talks</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry arrives in Israel in a bid to inject momentum into peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians.</description>

      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry is to meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders in an attempt to inject momentum into peace talks launched three months ago. "I come here without any illusions about the difficulties, but I come here determined to work," Mr Kerry said. The talks, due to end next April, have shown little sign of progress. Mr Kerry has denied media speculation that he may propose a new interim peace deal. His visit follows earlier stopovers in Saudi Arabia and Egypt. Mr Kerry will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem on Wednesday. He brokered the peace talks that opened in late July, after several years of stalemate. Mr Kerry is pursuing an agreement based on a "two-state solution" that envisages Israel and a Palestinian state - consisting of the West Bank and Gaza - existing alongside each other. "We believe this is something that is possible and that it's good for all and can be achieved," Mr Kerry said on Tuesday at a ceremony in Tel Aviv marking 18 years since the assassination of Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin. He has previously said that all final-status issues - Jerusalem, borders, security arrangements, settlements and Palestinian refugees - are on the table. He has denied speculation over an interim deal, saying: "Let me categorically dispel any notion that there is anything other than the track that is formally engaged in between Israel and the Palestinians. "There is no other plan at this point in time," he said during his recent trip to Saudi Arabia. The negotiating sessions have been held in secret locations and at undisclosed times as part of a US-requested media blackout. But both sides have voiced frustration at a lack of progress on core issues. Mr Netanyahu wants Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state as a priority, whereas the Palestinians say borders and security top their agenda. The Palestinians want their state to include land captured by Israel in 1967, but some 500,000 Israelis now live in settlements built on the occupied territories. Mr Netanyahu has rejected any return to the 1967 lines as "indefensible", saying it would not take into account the "demographic changes on the ground". The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. </body>

      <title>Tajik leader set to win another term</title>
      <description>Tajikistan is voting in presidential elections, with incumbent leader Imomali Rakhmon widely expected to win a new term in the impoverished country.</description>

      <body>Voters in Tajikistan are casting their ballots, with incumbent President Imomali Rakhmon widely expected to win a new seven-year term. Mr Rakhmon, 61, faces five challengers, but the only genuine opposition candidate is barred from standing. The authoritarian leader has been in office for more than 20 years in the impoverished former Soviet republic. The EU and the US have not recognised a single election in the Central Asian country as free and fair. Polls across the mountainous country were due to open at 01:00 GMT and close at 15:00 GMT. Preliminary results are expected on Thursday. Mr Rakhmon, who secured 79% of the vote in the 2006 election, did not campaign actively this time. Instead, the president relied on extensive media coverage of his visits around the country, which his opponents say was heavily biased in his favour. The opposition accuses Mr Rakhmon - whose huge billboards are seen everywhere in the capital Dushanbe and other towns - of developing a personality cult. He denies the claim. The five other presidential candidates have refrained from publicly criticising Mr Rakhmon. Human rights activists Oynihol Bobonazarova - widely seen as the only genuine opposition candidate - is banned from the polls. The electoral commission said earlier she had failed to collect the necessary 210,000 signatures of eligible voters to be officially registered. Despite the expected easy victory, critics say Mr Rakhmon will face rising social tension in the country where some 50% of the population live in poverty. Almost half of the nation's GDP is earned by more than one million Tajik migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, Analysts say Tajikistan could also face further security challenges from Islamist groups in neighbouring Afghanistan after the planned pullout of the US-led forces next year. Tajikistan was devastated by the 1992-97 civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition. Up to 50,000 were killed before the conflict ended with a UN-brokered peace agreement. </body>

      <title>Brazil spying 'different' from US</title>
      <description>Brazil's justice minister defends his country's spying activities, saying they were "completely different" from those carried out by the US.</description>

      <body>Brazil's justice minister has defended his country's spying activities, saying they were "completely different" from those carried out by the United States. Jose Eduardo Cardoso said agents who photographed US, Russian and other diplomats in Brazil were acting lawfully. Allegations about agents' activities were leaked in the national press. Reports of email and phone spying on Brazil have prompted President Dilma Rousseff to postpone a visit to the US. Brazil's counter-intelligence activities reports have caught the attention of the international media, with the New York Times saying they put Brazil in an "uncomfortable position" after it had harshly criticised the US authorities. But Mr Cardoso said any attempt to compare Brazilian and US activities was a mistake. "I see completely different situations. What happened in relation to Brazil and other countries was a violation. Emails and phone calls were violated, which is an affront to Brazilian sovereignty," he told reporters. The minister described the alleged activities as "counter-intelligence" operations, intended to "verify whether other countries were spying" on Brazil. The report leaked to Brazil's Folha de S. Paulo newspaper says agents from the national intelligence agency, Abin, followed and photographed diplomats from at least three countries: the US, Iran and Russia. It has since been officially confirmed by Abin. The US state department suggested Brazil's activities were routine. "As we have indicated in the past, all nations gather foreign intelligence," it said in a statement, which also sought to reinforce the countries' "partnership". Brazil was angered by revelations that the US National Security Agency (NSA) had hacked the computer network of state-run oil company Petrobras to collect data on emails and telephone calls. The allegations of electronic espionage also led to Brazil and Germany asking the UN General Assembly to adopt a draft resolution calling for the right to privacy in the digital age. </body>

      <body>Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has vowed to stay on and run for re-election next year, dismissing calls he resign after admitting he smoked crack cocaine. Earlier, Mr Ford admitted smoking the drug in a "drunken stupor", though he has said he is neither an addict nor an alcoholic. He publicly apologised, saying he was "embarrassed" by his behaviour. "I love my job, I love this city," he said. "I know I have to regain your trust and confidence." Mr Ford said he had kept his illicit behaviour from his family, staff and political colleagues. "There is only one person to blame for this and that is myself," he told reporters at a packed press conference on Tuesday. "Folks, I have nothing left to hide... I would do anything, absolutely anything to change the past, but the past is the past and we must move forward. "I want to be crystal clear... these mistakes will never, ever, ever happen again." Mr Ford told reporters earlier in the day he had taken the drug about a year ago. His admission follows revelations that a video apparently showing him smoking crack cocaine - long rumoured in the media to exist but never released publicly - was in the possession of the police. The mayor had previously called for the release of the video. "I want everyone in the city to see this tape," he said. "I don't even recall there being a tape or video. I want to see the state that I was in." Last week, Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair said investigators had recovered footage from a deleted hard drive that appeared to show Mr Ford smoking from a crack pipe. Police have not revealed details of the mobile phone clip, but say it is consistent with previous descriptions from media organisations that reported viewing it. The police have also not charged Mr Ford with any offence. His friend and occasional driver Alexander "Sandro" Lisi faces charges of marijuana trafficking, possession and extortion in connection with the video. Police have said they expect the video will come out when Mr Lisi goes to trial. Mr Ford has also challenged allegations he had lied when denying using crack cocaine, telling the media earlier in the day, "I wasn't lying. You didn't ask the correct questions." Six months ago, the mayor said: "I do not use crack cocaine, nor am I an addict." The allegations of drug use first surfaced in May after journalists with the gossip website Gawker and the Toronto Star reported seeing the video. In the intervening months, one city councillor put forward a motion demanding the mayor take a leave of absence and co-operate with a police investigation. Another councillor, Jaye Robinson, told broadcaster CBC that Mr Ford no longer had "a shred of credibility". </body>

      <description>Fears about disruption to next year's World Cup are raised as the key global football conference Soccerex is cancelled by the Rio authorities.</description>

      <body>Fears about disruption to next year's World Cup have been raised after the key global football conference Soccerex was cancelled because of continuing civil unrest. It was due to start in just three weeks time at the Maracana stadium. The England manager, Roy Hodgson, was among a number of high-profile figures who were planning to attend the event. The organisers and Rio's state government disagreed over why the event is being called off. In a statement, the organisers said the government took the decision because of "ongoing civil unrest" in Brazil. This was later "strongly denied" by the state government of Rio, citing instead funding problems. "The governor says he encouraged the organisers to seek cultural and sports incentive funding to finance the event, but the organisers failed to do so," it said in a statement read out by Fifa's head of media at a news conference in London. The event would have been the last of four scheduled Soccerex conventions to be held in Rio. The organisers said they would be taking legal action against the Rio authorities responsible. "Preparations for the event at the Maracana Stadium were well advanced with content planned, speakers confirmed and partnerships in place," a statement said. "To be summarily cancelled in such a cavalier fashion, having hosted 33 events over five continents is extremely frustrating but nevertheless it has happened and is in contravention of all of the contractual obligations of the Rio State Government, who have been notified of our intention to instigate legal proceedings for substantial compensation." Soccerex chief executive Duncan Revie called the cancellation "cruel" and said he wanted to apologise to "every business, football club, league, federation and media organisation affected by this news". Despite the sudden cancellation, world football governing body Fifa said it did not suggest heightened security fears for the World Cup. Fifa's marketing director, Thierry Weil, said: "We do not believe this will have any influence in any way or form on the organisation of the Fifa World Cup." Brazil, one of the fast-growing Brics nations, has seen its growth rate fall far from the 7.5% recorded in 2010 and is now growing at just short of 3% a year. That, and a sharp fall in the value of its currency, the real, has sparked a number of often violent anti-government protests this year. Among the protesters' concerns are corruption in public life as well as spending on hosting the World Cup and Olympics. People are also asking for more investment in public services, better public schools, hospitals and transportation. These demonstrations affected the Confederations Cup in June, prompting fears about safety and security for next summer's World Cup finals. Soccerex has been running for the last 18 years. It brings together football federations and associations, major clubs, rights holders, leading brands, businessmen and others in the industry.

      <body>The Italian government has announced it will begin to limit the number of large cruise ships that pass through Venice. Environmentalists have protested against the ships in recent years, saying they damage the city's fragile lagoon. From January 2014, the number of cruise ships allowed through Venice will be cut by 20%. Ships of more than 96,000 tonnes will be banned from the centre of the city from November next year. Prime Minister Enrico Letta's office also announced plans to open up a new canal route to the city - thereby allowing big vessels to enter the city by a kind of back door, the BBC's Alan Johnston reports from Rome. The measures were announced after a meeting between Mr Letta, the mayor of Venice and other local politicians on Tuesday. A spokesman for those who have protested against the ships told Italian media that the measures constitute a first step and that their campaign will go on. Concerns over big ships sailing too close to shorelines have increased since the Costa Concordia cruise liner ran aground off a Tuscan island in January 2012, killing 32 people. Those who oppose the ships argue that they are grotesquely out of keeping with the beautiful old city and that they disgorge unsustainable numbers of visitors into the squares and alleyways, our correspondent reports. But there is also a powerful lobby in Venice that favours the cruise ship trade and welcomes the economic benefits it brings, he adds. </body>

      <body>A spinning wheel used by Indian independence hero Mahatma Gandhi while in prison has been sold at auction for about £110,000 ($180,000). He used it to spin thread and make his own clothes in Pune's Yerwada jail in the early 1930s. Gandhi gave the wheel to the American Free Methodist missionary Reverend Dr Floyd A Puffer in 1935. Auctioneers Mullock's said it had been sold to an anonymous phone bidder at Ludlow Racecourse in Shropshire. Richard Westwood-Brookes from the auction house said the price had "exceeded expectations." "The guide price for the wheel (between £60,000 ($96,000) and £80,000) was based on what the owner thought they could get, which I initially thought might be a bit high," he said. "Once the interest started to come in online and on the phones it took its own momentum." The portable spinning wheel, called a charkha in Hindi, "folds into a bundle about the size of a portable typewriter and has a handle for carrying. When unfolded for use it is operated by turning a small crank which runs the two wheels and spindle of the device", the American monthly Popular Science wrote in 1931. Gandhi spent time daily on spinning and often described it as a form of meditation. His artefacts are regularly sold at auctions and are popular with collectors. In February this year Mullock's set a record with a letter of Gandhi fetching £115,000. In May a collection including his sandals, shawl and other personal effects topped £250,000. Last year a pair of Gandhi's glasses with a guide price of £10,000 sold for £34,000 at the racecourse. </body>

      <body>Gambian TV talk show host Fatou Camara, who fled to the US after being charged with sedition, has told the BBC she will never go home while President Yahya Jammeh's government is in power. Ms Camara, who has also served as Mr Jammeh's press secretary, said she would not get a fair trial. She spent 25 days in jail in September before being charged with trying to tarnish the president's image. "It was all set up," she told the BBC's Focus on Africa, denying the charges. "How many people are jailed in Gambia based on anything because you know the judicial system, how do you trust it?" she said on the BBC World Service radio programme. "Who will win a case against the state in Gambia?" She said she believes she was targeted by people in government with personal grudges. "I think it's a group of people who are really jealous, who don't want me to do what I have to do or maybe I was becoming too popular for them," she said. The TV presenter, who jumped bail last month, initially fled to neighbouring Senegal before emerging in the US on Saturday with her family. She has twice served as Mr Jammeh's director of communications - for three months in 2011 and another three months earlier this year, and was sacked on both occasions. Until her arrest on 15 September, she presented the weekly talk show The Fatu Show on The Gambia's only television station. During her detention, Ms Camara said that intelligence officers demanded her Facebook and email passwords. She would reportedly have faced 15 years in jail if she was found guilty of sedition under new internet laws. The accusations are linked to false information about Mr Jammeh allegedly printed in the Freedom Newspaper, an online publication about The Gambia based in the US. After Ms Camara was granted bail, she said she lost her job. "I was told they have an executive directive that I should not appear on that TV again, you think it makes sense for me to stay there?" she said. "Already people are running away from me, nobody wants to talk to me because nobody wants to get in trouble, so I think what I did is the best thing." The Gambian government's treatment of journalists and opposition parties has long also caused huge concern among human rights groups. Mr Jammeh seized power in 1994 as a young army lieutenant and has won four widely criticised multi-party elections since then. Ms Camara said people in The Gambia were never openly critical of the president. "People are living in fear, people are not comfortable, people cannot even talk on the phone because they're scared somebody could be listening to their conversation." </body>

      <title>NFL player suspended for 'bullying'</title>

      <body>The US National Football League is investigating allegations that a Miami Dolphins player bullied a teammate. Richie Incognito, 30, was suspended on Sunday night amid claims by 24-year-old Jonathan Martin's representatives. Martin, 6ft 5in and 312lb (140kg), left the team last week to seek treatment for an emotional issue after reportedly being the victim of a prank. The investigation casts a spotlight on a culture of hazing that has long been common in league locker rooms. Incognito protested his innocence on Twitter before his suspension. The offensive guard, who was voted the NFL's Dirtiest Player in a 2009 player poll, is a nine-year professional who is nearing the end of a $13m (£8m) contract. Miami Dolphins head coach Joe Philbin told a news conference on Monday at the team's training facility: "The NFL is going to conduct a review of the workplace. "It's going to be comprehensive, it's going to be objective. "As an organisation we are going to give our full and complete co-operation with the NFL." Philbin said a decision had been made to suspend Incognito based partly on information from representatives of Martin, an offensive tackle in his second NFL season. The team said in a statement: "We believe in maintaining a culture of respect for one another and as a result we believe this decision is in the best interest of the organisation at this time." According to ESPN, Incognito's alleged intimidation of Martin included leaving him a voice message with a racial slur as well as threats to kill him and assault his mother. Incognito is white; Martin is black. The sports network also reported that Incognito had persuaded Martin to pay $15,000 towards a trip to Las Vegas that the younger man did not even go on. Speaking of Incognito, an unidentified team source told the Miami Herald on Monday: "From a club perspective, he will never play another game here." The nature of the alleged prank that led to Martin leaving the team last week is unclear. But in a stadium programme sold at the Dolphins' Halloween game, Incognito was asked who was the easiest teammate to scare, and he said: "Jonathan Martin." </body>

      <title>Mexico cartel horses fetch record sum</title>
      <description>The last of hundreds of racehorses, seized last year in an FBI raid on a ranch owned by a convicted money launderer from Mexico, are auctioned off.</description>

      <body>Racehorses seized during a raid on the ranch of the brother of a notorious Mexican cartel boss have sold at a record price at auction in the US. FBI agents had seized more than 400 horses from Jose Trevino Morales's ranch in Oklahoma in June 2012. Trevino Morales was found guilty of money laundering earlier this year and sentenced to 20 years in prison. His brother Miguel Angel, who led the Zetas drug cartel, was arrested earlier this year in Mexico. The last five of the hundreds of horses seized in the 2012 raid were sold at auction in Oklahoma City for a total of $3.1m (£1.9m). Tempting Dash, a racehorse, fetched $1.7m - a record for the quarter horse breed at an Oklahoma public auction. Prosecutors accused Jose Trevino Morales, 46, of running a multi-million dollar money laundering scheme in which which he bought, trained, raced and sold racehorses in the south-western United States to hide the illicit proceeds from the Zetas cartel. In May, he was found guilty of conspiracy to commit money laundering. In September, a US district judge sentenced him to 20 years in jail. His wife and daughter pleaded guilty to lesser charges. The Zetas are one of Mexico's most powerful and ruthless criminal cartels, controlling much of the drug trafficking from South America via Mexico to the United States. It was led until his arrest in July by Miguel Angel Trevino, who was captured by Mexican marines near the US border in Nuevo Laredo after a surveillance operation lasting several months. He has been charged with murder, torture, kidnapping and other crimes. </body>

      <title>Argentina finds secret junta files</title>
      <description>Files dating back to Argentina's period of military rule from 1976 to 1983 are found in an abandoned wing of the Air Force headquarters in Buenos Aires.</description>

      <body>Some 1,500 secret files, dating back to the years of military rule in Argentina, have been discovered in Buenos Aires. They were found in an abandoned wing of the Air Force headquarters. The files contain the transcripts of all meetings held by the military junta, which ruled the country from 1976 to 1983, said Defence Minister Agustin Rossi. The documents also name famous artists and intellectuals who were blacklisted. Folk singer Mercedes Sosa, writer Julio Cortazar, tango musician Osvaldo Pugliese and actress Norma Aleandro are among many banned or subjected to censorship for opposing the government. "They were classified from F1 to F4 according to their [perceived] level of threat [to society]," said Mr Rossi. It is still unclear whether the files will shed light on thousands of legal cases of opponents of the regime killed or disappeared by the military government, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. In the 1,500 files, were found 280 documents with the official records of meetings of the military junta. "For the first time we have access to documents covering the whole period of military rule," said Mr Rossi. "And the material is filed in chronological order and also classified by subject." The findings were announced at a media conference in Buenos Aires. There was no mention of files concerning the Falklands War, which ultimately precipitated the end of military rule. The Argentine government says the files will be published soon. The junta came to power in a military coup on 24 March 1976, deposing President Isabel Peron. Gen Jorge Rafael Videla became the president of the junta and handed over power to Gen Roberto Viola in 1981. The junta's other two members were Air Force Gen Orlando Ramon Agosti and Admiral Emilio Massera. Gen Videla died in jail in May, while serving a life sentence for crimes against humanity. Human rights groups say an estimated 30,000 people were killed during seven years of military rule in Argentina. </body>

      <title>DR Congo rebels 'end insurgency'</title>
      <description>The M23 rebel group in the Democratic Republic of Congo says it is ending its insurgency, hours after the government claimed military victory.</description>

      <body>The M23 rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo says it is ending its insurgency, hours after the government claimed military victory. In a statement, the movement said it would adopt "purely political means" to achieve its goals and urged its fighters to disarm and demobilise. The government said the last remaining rebels had either surrendered or fled the country overnight. The army says it will now pursue other rebel groups that do not disarm. At least 800,000 people have fled their homes since the M23 took up arms in 2012 but several other armed groups still operate in the mineral-rich eastern DR Congo. M23 leader Bertrand Bisimwa announced on Tuesday that "the chief of general staff and the commanders of all major units are requested to prepare troops for disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration on terms to be agreed with the government of Congo". His decision to pursue its aims by political means was posted on a Facebook page linked to the group. Although the statement came after an apparently heavy military defeat, it also followed an agreement by African leaders on Monday night that the M23 should make "a public declaration renouncing rebellion" to allow a peace accord to be signed with the Congolese government. Congolese Defence Minister Alexandre Luba Ntambo, after the summit in the South African capital Pretoria, said once the rebels had publicly abandoned their insurgency the government "would make a public declaration of acceptance of this". Five days later, a formal peace agreement would be signed, he added. The BBC's Milton Nkosi in South Africa says, with its announcement on Tuesday, the M23 appears to have met the conditions of the African leaders. While Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni was at the summit, Rwanda's Paul Kagame was conspicuous by his absence, our correspondent says. Rwanda's foreign minister was at the meeting, however. The UN has regularly accused Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the M23, although both governments deny the allegation. The US and other donors have cut aid to Rwanda over the allegations. 'Hit-and-run operations' DR Congo Information Minister Lambert Mende said on Tuesday that Congolese special forces had driven the rebels out of their final hilltop strongholds near the Ugandan border. Tanks and helicopters from a UN intervention brigade with a tough new mandate to "neutralise" rebel groups approved earlier this year have also been involved in recent fighting. "We can say that it's finished. But you never know," Mr Mende told the BBC's Newsday programme. "Those who escaped can come with hit-and-run operations so we have to end everything politically so that we are sure our people can sleep quietly without any threat." Rebel military chief Sultani Makenga was among those who had crossed the border either to Rwanda or Uganda, he added. Army spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli said it was "a victory for the Congolese people" but it was now important to sue for peace. "We now speak to other armed groups to surrender because if they don't want to, then we will disarm them by force," the army spokesman told the BBC. A number of rebel factions operate in the two eastern provinces of North and South Kivu. The information minister also warned that other rebel groups would now be targeted by the army. "There is no more place in our country for any irregular group," Mr Mende told AFP news agency. The M23, made up mainly of ethnic Tutsis, had now been replaced as "top of the list" by the Rwandan Hutu FDLR militia, he said. "We are going to get on with disarming them." Rwanda's Tutsi-led government has twice invaded DR Congo, saying it wanted to stop Hutu groups, such as the FDLR, from attacking its territory. Analysts say that if the FDLR were defeated, this would remove Rwanda's main justification for its involvement in Congolese affairs, although it denies backing the M23. US special envoy Russell Feingold told reporters in Pretoria the M23's announcement was "a significant, positive step". Rebels should be protected when they had disarmed, he said, but those guilty of serious crimes should not be given an amnesty. Peace talks broke down in October in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, following two months of negotiations. The Congolese army began a big offensive against rebel positions on 25 October, securing their last major stronghold at Bunagana on the Ugandan border last week. The M23, made up of army deserters, was named after a 23 March 2009 peace deal signed by the government and a former militia. The rebels accused the government of failing to live up to the terms of the agreement and took up arms in April 2012, at one point seizing the regional capital, Goma. Earlier this year, heavy fighting broke out between rebel factions of the M23 which led to one of its leaders, Bosco Ntaganda, fleeing to the US embassy in Rwanda. The former Congolese army general, known as "the Terminator", then surrendered to the International Criminal Court to face trial in The Hague on war crimes charges. The end of the M23 would send an intimidating message to the other groups, raising hopes of an end to two decades of conflict, BBC Africa security correspondent Moses Rono says. Eastern DR Congo has been wracked by conflict since 1994, when Hutu militias fled across the border from Rwanda after carrying out a genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. </body>

      <body>Kenya is holding its first commercial auction of East African art in the capital, Nairobi, with 47 works going under the hammer. Prices are expected to range from several hundred dollars for some pieces up to more than $28,000 (£17,400). The auction is a sign of the growing profile of the region's art scene, as well as the growth of a a wealthy elite, experts say. International collectors are increasingly focusing on African art. Last month, London hosted the first international fair dedicated to modern and contemporary African art. Earlier this year, London auction house Bonhams sold the work of eight leading Kenyan artists at a charity auction. The works of Kenyan artists will dominate the auction, but artists from Ethiopia, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda will also be featured. The Circle Art Agency, which is organising the auction at Nairobi's Kempinski Hotel later on Tuesday, says some of the works for sale have not been seen in public for decades. "There are some hidden treasures that form part of Kenya's cultural history dating from 1967 to 2013," it said. "Over the last few months we travelled to numerous places in search of exceptional works, many of which were buried away in artist's studios in neighbouring towns or hanging on hidden corridors in collectors' homes," Danda Jaroljmek, from Circle Art Agency, told Kenya's Star newspaper. One of the most expensive items going up for sale is a sculpture called Dancing Warrior by the late, influential Kenyan artist Samuel Wanjau. It is expected to fetch between $25,000 and $28,500. "His work and career is emblematic of a time when artists were breaking away from the mass production of co-operatives and finding distinctive individual voices," the auction notes say. Lot 47 is entitled Auction by Kenyan artist Michael Soi, who painted it to celebrate Tuesday's sale. Some of his most widely collected paintings are from a recent series called China Loves Africa, The Circle Art Agency says. He has also tackled controversial issues like the cases of Kenya's leaders at the International Criminal Court and is currently painting a series on prostitution. "I do not create controversy; I just create work that revolves around things that I see. So, I want to believe that society itself is creating the controversy, all I'm doing is just documenting it," he told the AFP news agency. It is not only those in East Africa's growing art scene who have welcomed the Nairobi auction. "I think it's very exciting, and I think from an investor's point of view, and someone who appreciates art, I think it's only going one way, and that's going higher," Aly-Khan Satchu, an investment adviser in Nairobi, told AFP. </body>

      <description>18th century paintings of a kangaroo and a dingo by George Stubbs are saved for the nation by a final £1.5m donation, following an export bar in January.</description>

      <body>Two 18th century George Stubbs paintings, featuring a kangaroo and a dingo, are to stay in Britain after an appeal backed by David Attenborough. A £1.5m donation from shipping magnate Eyal Ofer has enabled the National Maritime Museum to buy the paintings. Commissioned after Captain James Cook's first Endeavour voyage, they were put under an export bar in January after being sold to a buyer outside the UK. They are the first known depictions of the Australian animals in Western art. Kongouro from New Holland and Portrait of a Large Dog were first exhibited together in London in 1773 and have remained in the UK ever since. Stubbs used sketches and specimens to create the paintings in the UK. Both paintings were privately owned until they were sold in late 2012, when they were put under an export bar because of their place in British history and artistic culture. Attenborough, who backed the nationwide Save Our Stubbs appeal, said it was "Exciting news that these two pictures, so important in the history of zoological discovery, are to remain where they were commissioned and painted." A statement from the National Maritime Museum said it was "delighted" with the donation from the Eyal Ofer Family Foundation. Contributions from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Monument Trust, the Art Fund and the public also helped the museum to purchase the paintings, which it says will "greatly enhance" its permanent collection. It already holds collections relating to Cook's three great voyages and these paintings will be central to a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Cook's Endeavour voyage in 2018. The works will initially go on display in the historic Queen's House, which is part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, in summer 2014. The gallery space will be named The Eyal Ofer Gallery. The shipping magnate has supported numerous projects including the new building programme at Tate Modern and the Royal Row Barge Gloriana for Her Majesty's the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. "My family has a long connection with this great maritime institution and these paintings are a landmark in Britain's history of maritime exploration and Captain Cook's voyages," he said. The export licence deferral was placed on the pictures in January by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, who said it was "great news" that the "strange and wonderful paintings will be available to be enjoyed by everyone for generations to come." </body>

      <body>A 14-year-old girl became pregnant after being taken to Pakistan by her father and forced to marry a man, a judge has said. She was subjected to violence during which a gun was produced, according to Mr Justice Holman. The girl returned to England where she gave birth. Details emerged in a written ruling following a hearing in the Family Division of the High Court in Birmingham. Two weeks after the ceremony, the marriage was consummated, the ruling said. The judge said: "The girl has given an account of the circumstances surrounding that marriage which are, frankly, harrowing. "On her account... this was a grave example of a marriage which was forced under considerable duress, involving at one stage the production of a gun and physical violence upon her. "The marriage was consummated about two weeks later after further threats to her if she did not permit her husband, who was then aged about 24, to have sexual intercourse with her. "As a result, while still aged 14, she became pregnant." Local authority officials wanted the marriage nullified, but the judge said the girl would have to initiate proceedings herself for this to take place. </body>

      <body>The British ambassador in Berlin has been called in to Germany's foreign ministry to respond to spying allegations. The UK's Independent newspaper says the British embassy in Berlin may house a "top-secret listening post". It cites leaked US National Security Agency (NSA) documents suggesting the UK could be using hi-tech equipment housed on the embassy roof. Any such activity would be against international law, Berlin says. A spokesman for David Cameron said the prime minister had not spoken to Chancellor Angela Merkel about the spying allegations and there were no plans for a conversation, although their relationship was "excellent". He refused to comment on security issues but said Britain's intelligence services operated under a "strong and clear legal framework". German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle had requested the attendance of UK ambassador Simon McDonald to respond to the claims, a ministry spokesman said. "The head of the European department asked for a response to current reports in the British media, and pointed out that the interception of communications from the premises of a diplomatic mission would be behaviour contrary to international law," he said. The Independent report, published on Tuesday, was based on NSA documents leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. The report said the NSA documents, in conjunction with aerial photographs and information about past spying activities in Germany, suggest that Britain is operating a covert listening station close to the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's offices. Aerial photographs of the embassy in Berlin show a white, tent-like structure, which the newspaper says has been in place since the embassy was opened in 2000. Equipment within the unit "would be capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications across the German capital," the Independent reported. It follows revelations that the US has listened to mobile phone calls made by Mrs Merkel since 2002. The row has led to a serious diplomatic crisis between the two countries. </body>

      <title>Masters' unknown works in Nazi trove</title>
      <description>Previously unknown artworks by masters are among more than 1,400 pieces found in a trove of Nazi-looted art in Munich, German officials say.</description>

      <body>Previously unknown artworks by masters are among more than 1,400 pieces found in a trove of Nazi-looted art in Munich, German officials say. As slides of the paintings were shown at a news conference, an expert said the works had been seized from private individuals or institutions. Previously unregistered works by Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse were found. Prosecutors said the issue of ownership was still being clarified. The total value has been estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Reinhard Nemetz, head of the prosecutors' office in Augsburg, said that 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works had been seized in the flat of Cornelius Gurlitt in Munich in March of last year. It was not yet clear if any offence had been committed, he added, stressing that the legal position was extremely complex. Investigators, he said, had turned up "concrete evidence" that at least some of the works had been seized by the Nazis from their owners or had been deemed "degenerate". Art expert Meike Hoffmann said some of the works were dirty but they had not been damaged. "When you stand before the works and see again these long-lost, missing works, that were believed destroyed, seeing them in quite good condition, it's an extraordinarily good feeling," Ms Hoffmann said. "The pictures are of exceptional quality, and have very special value for art experts. Many works were unknown until now." Other artists whose works were found include Pablo Picasso and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as Canaletto and Gustave Courbet. The paintings were found in March of last year after Mr Gurlitt was investigated for tax evasion. The framed pictures were stacked on a shelf, like in a museum storeroom while the unframed works were piled up in drawers, said customs official Siegfried Kloeble. According to a report by Germany's Focus magazine, Mr Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich, would occasionally sell a picture when he needed money. "We don't have any strong suspicion of a crime that would justify an arrest," said Mr Nemetz, adding that the current whereabouts of Mr Gurlitt were unknown. Asked at the news conference why the German authorities had taken so long to reveal the paintings, the prosecutor said it would have been "counter-productive to go public" with the case earlier. Mr Kloeble refused to say where the artworks were being stored. Mr Gurlitt's father Hildebrand collected early 20th Century art regarded by the Nazis as un-German or "degenerate", and removed from show in state museums. He was recruited by the Nazis to sell the "degenerate art" abroad but also bought privately. After the war he told investigators that his collection had been destroyed during the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. He also said he had been persecuted himself for having a Jewish grandmother. Resuming his work as a dealer, he died in a car crash in 1956. A Jewish group has questioned the length of time it took Germany to unveil the artworks and called for them to be returned to their original owners. "It cannot be, as in this case, that what amounts morally to the concealment of stolen goods continues," said Ruediger Mahlo, speaking for the Conference on Jewish material claims against Germany. Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the EU, told the BBC that time was running out, and the details of the artworks should be published. "Victims of the Holocaust are aging, even the families of those who did not survive are of an age," he said. "It's important that this be publicised. But the longer one goes... the more difficult it is for people to prepare potential claims... Justice delayed is justice denied." However, prosecutors say it would not be proper procedure to put things on the internet and people who want to make a claim should contact them directly. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Munich says that descendents of owners of art taken by German forces in occupied Europe may be able to make claims. However, there are suggestions that art taken in Germany itself may not be reclaimable because of a 30-year statute of limitations. Mr Mahlo said that private collections of such art under the Third Reich had been almost all Jewish. However, auctioneers have argued that at least some of the works were purchased cheaply in 1938 by Mr Gurlitt's father from a collection of state-owned art. In 1990, Cornelius Gurlitt auctioned works for 38,250 Swiss francs (31,000 euros) in Galerie Kornfeld, an auction house and gallery in the Swiss city of Bern. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galerie Kornfeld said: "Cornelius Gurlitt inherited the works after the death of his mother Helene. Basically this is a case of undeclared inheritance." </body>

      <body>Iran's Culture Minister, Ali Jannati, has said that social networks should be made accessible to ordinary Iranians. Mr Jannati was quoted by the Irna state news agency as singling Facebook out for special mention, saying it should be available for everyone. Such sites were blocked in 2009, when millions protested against the result of a disputed presidential election. But senior officials, including Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, have begun to use them extensively. Ordinary Iranians are forced to use virtual private networks (VPNs) if they want to bypass the restrictions. In September, social networks were unblocked for a day, but officials blamed this on a technical error. The government of President Hassan Rouhani reportedly does not have the sole authority to end the restrictions, which Mr Jannati said were overseen by the "Filtering Committee". "We need to talk to all the people in that committee, because not only Facebook, but also other social networks have to be accessible, and there should be no legal constraints to access them," he was quoted as saying by the Isna news agency. The minister noted that filtering could "not stop people from accessing information", citing the failure of the Iranian authorities' jamming of foreign satellite channels and banning of satellite dishes. </body>

      <title>Syria peace conference delayed</title>
      <description>UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi says a peace conference he had hoped to hold in Geneva this month on the Syria conflict has been delayed.</description>

      <body>The UN-Arab League envoy on Syria has said that a peace conference he had hoped to hold in Geneva this month has been delayed but he is still "striving" for a summit by the end of the year. Lakhdar Brahimi said after a day of meetings with senior diplomats that he was not able to announce a date. Attempts to set up a conference have been going on for months amid disputes over who should attend and its agenda. Mr Brahimi said he would meet US and Russian diplomats again on 25 November. "We were hoping that we'd be in a position to announce a date today, unfortunately we're not," he told reporters. "But we're still hoping that we'll be able to have the conference before the end of the year." The envoy added that "nothing dramatic" had happened at Tuesday's talks and the failure to agree a date had been expected for several weeks. Mr Brahimi held talks with US Under-Secretary of State Wendy Sherman and Russian deputy foreign ministers Mikhail Bogdanov and Gennady Gatilov, then later with the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - the UK, France and China - as well as Syria's neighbours Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey. The idea of a conference was first mooted in May, and in September UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced a tentative date of mid-November after the Security Council passed a binding resolution on Syrian chemical weapons. Mr Brahimi said Mr Ban continued to be "impatient" to have a conference, saying that the situation was getting worse with 6,000 people leaving the country every day. Aid agencies have warned that more than nine million Syrians, almost half the population, are now in need of humanitarian relief. Only Syria's government and opposition groups can reach a peace deal and make it stick - but the stumbling blocks are large, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva. The opposition is divided, the Syrian government does not appear ready to talk about a transition and, it seems, the US and Russia still do not agree on whether Syria's key regional neighbour Iran should be present. The Syrian government expects to take part in eventual negotiations, while the opposition says Syrian President Bashar al-Assad should step down first. But presidential adviser Bouthaina Shaaban told the BBC the issue of Mr Assad's departure was not on the table and he would only go if voted out of office. "I think this would be left to the Syrian people to discuss and decide. I don't think the issue is about power now," she said. The UN estimates that more than two million people have fled Syria since the unrest began in March 2011 resulting in a humanitarian crisis. Most have sought refuge in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. More than 100,000 people are estimated to have been killed since the conflict began. </body>

      <title>Workers await news on shipyard jobs</title>
      <description>Hundreds of workers on the Clyde and south coast wait to hear about their jobs after the BBC learned defence company BAE Systems is to announce cuts at three UK shipyards.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24831779</url>

      <body>Workers at BAE Systems shipyards on the Clyde and the south coast of England are awaiting news of major job losses. The BBC has learned the company may cut more than 1,000 jobs at Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow and at Portsmouth. An announcement is due on Thursday on the cuts. It is understood Govan will not close. The job losses are expected to result from a reduction in work for the Royal Navy following the completion of two giant aircraft carriers. Union leaders have said they will hold talks with BAE Systems early next week. Some of the jobs being lost may be offset by a contract to build the new Type 26 Global Combat Ship. But BAE Systems has yet to announce which of its UK shipyards will be chosen to carry out the work. A well-placed source has told the BBC the government was "acutely conscious of the politics of the Clyde" ahead of next year's referendum on Scottish independence. But the Scottish secretary of the GMB union, Harry Donaldson, said any decision should be based on economic rather than political grounds. He told BBC Breakfast: "To be perfectly frank I think it is disgraceful that politicians are getting into looking at these yards as a political football. "It needs to be about communities, it needs to be about people and it needs to be about what is best for Scotland and the rest of the UK as a maritime nation. "I just hope that the politicians can get their act together, think of the future, think of safeguarding jobs and investing in getting these Type 26 orders forward for order fulfilment so we can make a smooth transition. "We may well lose some jobs in the interim, but keeping these yards open, that is the major issue, so people can get the opportunity to come back into employment". He called on the government to bring forward the Type 26 orders in order to create a transitional phase, because: "If you lose the jobs then you lose the skills and the problem is you will lose the ability to then compete in a very competitive marketplace" BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the announcement by BAE Systems would be followed by a Commons statement from the defence secretary later on Thursday. The job losses would result from the completion of work on the building of the two aircraft carriers and from a huge increase in the costs of that project, he added. It emerged on Monday that the UK government was planning to announce that it will need to spend an extra £800m on the carriers, taking the total costs to more than £6bn - double the original estimate. Beyond the carriers there are currently no new orders on the books of BAE's Glasgow yards at Govan and Scotstoun. Any job losses, however, may not take effect immediately because some work on the aircraft carriers is planned until 2015. The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said it would hold talks with senior BAE Systems executives early next week to "examine the business case" of the forthcoming announcement on jobs. General secretary Hugh Scullion said: "Now is not the time for idle speculation or indeed party political point scoring; this is the future of an industry and we need to know from the company and the government directly what their plans for the future of UK shipbuilding are." There are currently 3,200 people employed by BAE across Govan and Scotstoun, and 1,200 employed in shipbuilding at Portsmouth. BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago. A BAE spokeswoman said: "We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Defence to explore all possible options to determine how best to sustain the capability to deliver complex warships in the UK in the future. "This work is ongoing and we are committed to keeping our employees and trade unions informed as it progresses." Shadow defence minister Vernon Coaker called on the government to give "urgent clarification" on the future of the UK's shipyards and dismissed accusations that Labour was responsible for the overspend incurred in building the two aircraft carriers. The Scottish government has said it has been in dialogue for some time with BAE Systems over the future of the Clyde shipyards. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a "very worrying time" and the workforce at both the Govan and the Scotstoun yards deserved to know what the future held. "Scotland is a maritime nation. If you look at countries similar to Scotland, like Norway, they have got much bigger shipbuilding industries than we do so there's no reason why both of these yards shouldn't have a secure, long-term future," she said. </body>

      <title>Taskforce hunts for burka suspect</title>
      <description>A taskforce has been assembled to locate and catch a terror suspect who escaped from his government minders by disguising himself in a burka.</description>

      <body>A taskforce has been assembled to try to locate and catch a terror suspect who escaped from his government minders by disguising himself in a burka. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, who was subject to an order restricting his movements, left a London mosque on Friday with his face and body covered. The Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command, MI5 and the UK Border Agency are now joining forces to find him. He is the second terror suspect under a so-called TPim order to go missing. The terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPim) have come under intense scrutiny since the Briton, who is of Somali origin, absconded from the mosque in Acton, west London. His disappearance has caused acute embarrassment to the home secretary, who introduced the measures. TPims are placed on terror suspects - who officials decide can neither be charged nor deported - by the home secretary. The measures, which need to be approved by a court and expire after a maximum of two years, include electronic tagging, reporting regularly to the police and travel exclusions. They were introduced in 2012 to replace the more restrictive control orders. Mr Mohamed is believed to have close links to al-Shabab, the Somali insurgent group that raided Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in September, resulting in 67 deaths, but officials say there was not enough evidence to bring a criminal case against him in court. Within hours of Mr Mohamed's disappearance, an alert to ports notice was issued. Along with his photograph, it placed him on a Warnings Index Database. While UK Border Agency officers at Britain's ports and airports look out for the suspect, intelligence officers are working closely with the police to try to second-guess where he would be likely to go. One possibility is that he could lie low and stay in Britain. Investigators are considering the probability that he will make contact with elements of the criminal underworld, although he may be wary of exploiting existing links. To stay out of custody he will need a new, forged identity, but he still risks being recognised and having his whereabouts phoned in to the police by the public. If he can make it to Kenya there is a well-established secret pipeline used by al-Shabab associates to pass through the country on their way from Europe and the US to Somalia. The Kenyan authorities may be able to apprehend him, but plenty of jihadist volunteers have used the porous Kenya-Somali border to slip through the net and join al-Shabab. The UK government estimates there are still around 50 British jihadists training and fighting with al-Shabab in Somalia. That number is dwarfed by those heading to Syria to join al-Qaeda-linked groups there. A third potential option under consideration is that Mr Mohamed could flee to Europe. If he can assume a new identity then he may be able to assimilate himself into the Somali diaspora in a European country with a sizeable community, such as Norway. But most Somalis do not want to be associated with al-Shabab and, with his picture so widely circulated, he could again be easily recognised. The open judgement handed down by the High Court on his case last year said the security service assessed him as being linked to a group of six British nationals who received terrorist training from al-Qaeda operatives in Somalia in 2006. The judgement says he also fought on the front line in Somalia in support of al-Shabab, and between 2008 and 2010 was "engaged in procuring weapons for use in furthering his terrorism-related activity". A Home Office spokesman confirmed that if the police do succeed in catching him, Mr Mohammed will be arrested, as breaching a TPim order is classed as a criminal offence. The other TPim absconder, named as Ibrahim Magag, escaped in a taxi on Boxing Day in 2012. He has never been caught. </body>

      <description>Microsoft warns that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has warned that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers. It said attackers could exploit this by requesting users to preview or open a specially crafted email or web content. Microsoft said it was "aware of targeted attacks" and was investigating. The issue affects Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Office 2003 - 2010, and Microsoft Lync. The current versions of Microsoft Windows and Office are not affected by the issue - which centres on a graphics component. Microsoft said it would take appropriate action to address the issue, which "may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs". In the meantime, it has advised customers to apply workarounds - a setting or configuration change that "does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available". According to Microsoft, the flaw lies in the handling of the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image files by a graphics processing component in the affected software versions. In a blog post on the Microsoft Security Response Centre, Dustin Childs a communications manager, said any move by hackers "requires user interaction". He said that the attacks are disguised as an email requesting potential targets to open a specially crafted Word attachment. If the attachment is opened or previewed, it attempts to exploit the issue using a malformed graphics image embedded in the document. "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user," Mr Childs said. Microsoft added that hackers could also exploit the issue via a web-based attack. "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website," it said. However, it added that an attacker would have "no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content". "Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website." </body>

      <body>Indonesia's economy expanded at its weakest rate in four years in the third quarter as a result of slowing exports and subdued domestic demand. Its economy grew 5.6% in the July-to-September period from a year earlier, down from 5.8% in the previous quarter. Indonesia's exports have been hurt by slowing demand from key markets and a drop in commodity prices. Meanwhile, domestic demand has been impacted by rising fuel prices and rising interest rates. Fuel prices in the country surged earlier this year after the government removed its subsidy programme. Petrol prices went up by 44% while diesel prices rose by 22%, leading to higher transportation costs and electricity bills. Indonesia, like many other emerging economies, was also hurt after investors withdrew money from emerging markets earlier this year. The pullout was triggered by growing speculation that the US central bank will start to taper off its key stimulus programme and start raising interest rates sooner than previously thought. In Indonesia's case, concerns of slowing economic growth and a widening current account deficit further contributed to that pull out. All of this has hurt the Indonesian currency which has dipped nearly 17% against the US dollar since May this year. A weak currency coupled with rising consumer prices has resulted in the central bank raising the cost of borrowing in the country. The latest raise in September saw the key rate rise to 7.25%, the highest level in more than four years. Analysts said that the combination of all these factors had hurt domestic consumption and impacted growth. In September, the country's central bank also lowered its growth forecast. It now expects the economy to grow by 5.5-5.9% compared with its earlier projection of growth of 5.8-6.2%. </body>

      <title>EU sees 'hope' but also lower growth</title>
      <description>The European Commission says the EU's economy is at a "turning point", but cuts next year's eurozone growth prediction and says unemployment will stay high.</description>

      <body>The European Commission has said the European economy has reached a "turning point", but the eurozone will grow less quickly than previously expected. The Commission said there were "signs of hope" that had started to turn into "tangible positive outcomes". But in the eurozone - the 18 nations that use the euro - it predicted growth of 1.1% next year. This is the second downward revision of 2014 eurozone growth this year, after it was cut from 1.4% to 1.2% in May. The Commission forecast that the eurozone would grow 1.7% in 2015. In the EU as a whole, it expects 1.4% growth next year and 1.9% in 2015. It said overall EU growth would be flat this year, up from its May forecast, but unemployment would stay at 11.1%. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the subdued forecasts reflected the "general sluggishness" of the eurozone economy. "The norm for the eurozone is still pretty dreadful, really. Even these forecasts are still likely to be too optimistic," he said. On an individual country basis, the Commission significantly upgraded its forecasts for the UK from 0.6% to 1.3% for this year and from 1.7% to 2.2% for next year. "[The year] 2013 has thus far exceeded expectations and the outlook is quite bright," the report said on the UK. "There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point," said Olli Rehn, commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. But Mr Rehn warned unemployment would stay high. "It is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels," he added. The Commission now expects unemployment for the eurozone next year to stay at its current level of 12.2%, up from its previous forecast of 12.1%. It also expects unemployment to improve only gradually, staying around the current level for the next two years and only dropping to 11.8% in 2015. The Commission also warned that it expected the recovery to be gradual. "While the financial market situation has improved significantly and interest rates have declined for vulnerable countries, this has not yet fed through to the real economy," Mr Rehn said. In the eurozone - the 18 member states which use the euro - the Commission predicted growth of 1.1% next year, down from its May forecast of 1.2%, and 1.7% in 2015. The Commission blamed weaker investment and the fact it expected inflation to stay below the central bank target over the next two years. The Commission also expects Greece's recession this year to be slightly less severe than its earlier forecast, predicting a fall in growth of 4% this year, compared with its earlier prediction of a 4.2% fall. </body>

      <description>England's Alastair Cook and Michael Carberry hit unbeaten centuries, batting through day one against Australia A in Hobart.</description>

      <body>Openers Alastair Cook and Michael Carberry shone with unbeaten centuries as England made 318 without loss on the first day of their four-day Ashes warm-up game against Australia A in Hobart. After Cook won the toss, the two left-handers batted through the entire day. Carberry put himself firmly in Test contention with 153 not out, hitting 22 fours and lofting spinner Jon Holland for two straight sixes. Meanwhile, Cook played himself into form with a serene unbeaten 154. It was a dream Test audition for 33-year-old Carberry who, since winning his only Test cap in March 2010, has battled serious illness and set up his own business after qualifying as an electrician  in the expectation England might never come calling again. With an Ashes place up for grabs, and the first Test in Brisbane a fortnight away, he offered one chance - when he had already scored 135 - but did not look out of place alongside Cook, with whom he opened in that sole Test appearance against Bangladesh in Chittagong when they added 72 and 65. After making 78 in the previous warm-up game at Perth, Carberry's inclusion meant Joe Root moved down to number five, with Ian Bell rested - pointing towards a possible choice for the Test XI between Carberry and Yorkshire's Gary Ballance, who was handed another chance in the problem position of number six, despite a first-ball failure in Perth. Jonny Bairstow now looks out of contention for the number six role after failing to feature in either warm-up game, while Chris Tremlett's inclusion in a four-man attack, alongside Test certainties James Anderson, Stuart Broad and Graeme Swann, indicated he may be favourite for the third seamer's role ahead of Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin. Carberry was outscored by his captain early on as the two left-handers saw off the new ball, but came out of his shell after the opening stand had passed 50, hoisting uncapped slow left-armer Holland over mid-off for a couple of fours. Australia A skipper Moses Henriques found little assistance for his five-man attack while Holland, nominally the front-line spinner, was outbowled by part-timer Glenn Maxwell, who extracted more turn and bowled with greater economy. Cook, characteristically strong off his legs, brought up his fifty before lunch with successive fours off Maxwell's off-spin, and had made 80 by the time Carberry had only 44 to his name. But while Carberry took until halfway through the day to reach his half century, he did so in style with a flashing drive for four, moved up through the gears with some powerful pull shots and used his feet well against the spinners. Carberry survived a loud lbw appeal from Ben Cutting on 83, with replays showed the ball pitching a fraction outside leg stump, but Holland's return to the attack gave him the chance to draw level with Cook on 94 just before tea with an attractive cover-driven four and a lofted six. While Cook marked his century in the first over after the interval with an undemonstrative wave of his bat, his partner could be forgiven for a more emotional reaction to reaching the same landmark, three years after a blood clot on his lung threatened more than just his cricket career. And when his former Hampshire team-mate Maxwell served up an inviting half-volley on leg stump, Carberry helped it through long leg for four to complete his first hundred in England colours, removing his helmet to acknowledge his team-mates who rose to salute the centurion. By the 77th over, such was the fielding side's desperation they turned to the off-spin of Usman Khawaja, who boasts one first-class wicket in nearly six years. The Aussies had waited all day for a chance - and it finally came at 288-0 just after the second new ball was taken when Cutting found the edge as Carberry attempted another flashing drive, but Trent Copeland grassed a straightforward chance at gully, as if to sum up Australia's day. </body>

      <title>Manchester City 5-2 CSKA Moscow</title>
      <description>Manchester City brush CSKA Moscow aside to reach the last 16 of the Champions League for the first time.</description>

      <body>Alvaro Negredo's hat-trick ensured Manchester City moved into the Champions League knockout phase for the first time with a comfortable win over CSKA Moscow. Sergio Aguero was the initial inspiration, scoring two and setting up another for Negredo as City scored three times inside the first half-hour to make it a straightforward night for Manuel Pellegrini's side. Having already secured a victory in Moscow, City knew they would be able to progress into the last 16 at the third time of asking if they won again and Viktoria Plzen failed to beat holders Bayern Munich. Aguero's early penalty was followed by a cool finish before a cross for strike partner Negredo effectively ended the contest. Seydou Doumbia did pull a goal back for CSKA before the interval but the outstanding Samir Nasri set up Negredo's second just after half-time to restore City's three-goal advantage. Doumbia beat City keeper Costel Pantilimon, once again chosen ahead of England keeper Joe Hart, from the spot for his second but City were never seriously under threat at any time as they cruised to victory. It was fitting that Negredo, swiftly becoming a cult figure among City's fans and now dubbed "The Beast", had the final word when he completed his treble in the dying seconds with a header from substitute James Milner's cross. City had the taste for goals again following Saturday's 7-0 win against Norwich City and they wasted no time in signalling their intentions against an uninspiring CSKA team. The goals were flowing as early as the third minute when former Manchester United midfielder Zoran Tosic fouled David Silva, Aguero becoming City's highest scorer in European competition with 11 goals as he scored the penalty emphatically. And the striker showed his quality again after 20 minutes, receiving Nasri's pass before turning and scoring with a precise finish. Any notion of a CSKA comeback was banished as the Argentine then turned creator to set up the third for Negredo with a perfect low cross that left the Spaniard with a simple finish. The Russians showed some signs of life on half-time when they opened up City through the middle and Doumbia rounded Pantilimon to score. City, who replaced Fernandinho with Milner at half-time, responded six minutes after the restart when Yaya Toure's lofted pass into the area found Nasri, who unselfishly knocked the ball across the face of an open goal for Negredo to score with ease once again. The only blot on City's display had been some defensive carelessness that might have received greater punishment against better opponents. But as the result of the Plzen-Bayern game went their way, with the German side winning 1-0, Negredo rounded off a highly-satisfactory night for City when he headed in from Milner's delivery.

      <title>Troicki ban infuriates Djokovic</title>
      <description>Novak Djokovic says Viktor Troicki's 12-month ban is a "total injustice" and that he has lost faith in the anti-doping system.</description>

      <body>Novak Djokovic says Viktor Troicki's ban for missing a drugs test is a "total injustice" and that he has lost trust in the anti-doping system. Troicki had an 18-month ban for failing to provide a blood sample at April's Monte Carlo Masters cut to 12 months. The 27-year-old Serb claimed he had been given permission to delay the test as he felt unwell. "I think it's just not bad news for him. It makes me nervous as a player to do any kind of test," said Djokovic. "It proves again that this system of Wada (World Anti-Doping Agency) does not work." The original ban handed down by the ITF Anti-Doping Tribunal (IADT) was reduced this week by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas),  which found Troicki's "fault was not significant". Troicki had always claimed the doping control officer (DCO) in Monte Carlo assured him he could delay giving the blood sample, but Cas said on Tuesday "the DCO should have informed the player in clearer terms of the risks caused by his refusal to undergo a blood test". Speaking after his win over Roger Federer at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, Djokovic defended his countryman and was scathing about the role of the DCO. "I don't have trust in what's going on," said Djokovic, who has known Troicki since he was eight years old. "I don't know if tomorrow the representative, the DCOs - who are representatives of IDTM [International Doping Tests and Management] and Wada there at the tournaments - because of their inability to explain the rules in a proper way, I don't know if they're going to misplace the test that I have or anything worse than that." Djokovic, 26, also referred to the case of Croatia's Marin Cilic, who had a nine-month ban for testing positive for banned substance nikethamide  reduced to four months in October. "So what happened?" said Djokovic. "Who is going to be responsible for that? Whose duty is it going to be that he lost four or five months of points, money, everything. "That is his job, that is his life. Who is going to be answering for that? "Now in Viktor's case, he's going to be sanctioned until July next year, and this lady, the DCO, the representative that was there that day, she's going to come back tomorrow for the job. Nobody is going to answer for that. Only him. Why?" The six-time Grand Slam champion was also critical of the role played by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) in, as he saw it, not standing up for Troicki. "The ATP, which is supposed to be an association of players of tennis professionals, which is supposed to be the governing body, the association that stands behind the players, is not going to answer on this announcement," said Djokovic. "It is not going to do anything for Viktor. So Viktor is there by himself. Tomorrow it can be anybody else." </body>

      <body>Former Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed, who died after complications from a liver transplant on 27 October, has left his estate to his wife and other relatives, his will has revealed. He left his Manhattan penthouse, his home in East Hampton, New York, and the bulk of his estate to his wife, musician Laurie Anderson. His sister inherited about a quarter of his estate and a $500,000 (£313,185) bequest to care for their mother. Reed was 71 and had no children. The rocker married long-time partner Anderson in 2008. Tributes flooded in for Reed at the news of his death, including one from David Bowie who declared: "He was a master," and Reed's former Velvet Underground bandmate John Cale, who said: "The world has lost a fine songwriter and poet." Reed's second solo album Transformer, featuring Perfect Day and Walk on the Wild Side, was co-produced by Bowie. Other stars paying tribute included Iggy Pop, The Who, Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx, US singer Cyndi Lauper, Tom Morello, of Rage Against the Machine, actress Mia Farrow, British author Salman Rushdie and US actors Whoopi Goldberg and Samuel L Jackson. The Velvet Underground became renowned for their fusion of art and music and for collaborating with Andy Warhol. Although the band never achieved commercial success during the 1960s, their influence on music in later decades was widely recognised. The glam, punk and alternative rock movements of the 1970s, 80s and 90s were all indebted to Reed, whose songs were covered by the likes of REM, Bowie, Nirvana, Patti Smith and countless others. Music producer Brian Eno once summed up their influence by saying: "The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band." The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. After quitting The Velvet Underground in 1970, Reed released his self-titled debut in 1972, but it wasn't until the Bowie-produced LP Transformer later that year that he achieved chart success. Perfect Day enjoyed a revival in 1996 when it was featured in Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, and again a year later when it was re-recorded by a celebrity cast for a BBC charity single. As a solo artist, Reed released 20 studio albums. His last, Hudson River Wind Meditations, was released in 2007. </body>

      <title>Byford: £1m BBC pay-off 'not greed'</title>
      <description>The BBC's former deputy director general defends his controversial £949,000 redundancy pay-off, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it was "not greed on my part at all".</description>

      <body>Mark Byford, the former deputy director general of the BBC, has defended a controversial pay-off package that saw him leave the BBC with £949,000. He told BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire: "I absolutely don't think it was greed on my part at all". Byford left the BBC in 2011 after being made redundant as part of a drive to cut the number of highly-paid senior executives at the BBC. He sidestepped questions about paying any of the money back. He said the pay-off was "properly approved" and added: "I absolutely think I've done no wrong." A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), released in July this year, criticised the BBC for paying out £25m in severance to 150 outgoing senior BBC managers - £2m more than their contracts stipulated. Byford's payment was revealed to be the highest at £949,000, after 32 years of service at the BBC. Byford, speaking to Derbyshire during an interview to promote his new book, admitted it was a large sum but said that he had not wanted to leave the corporation. "I lost my job, I was made redundant, I left when I was told to leave by the BBC. After 32 years of working there I was devoted to the corporation," said Byford. "It was a lot of money and it was in a context that I was the number two at the BBC and I'd served more than 30 years there. "It was in a context of being made redundant in a very big cull of senior management. I felt very strongly myself that it should touch every level including right at the very top." He continued: "I didn't want to go, I loved my job but I absolutely understood that if it [redundancy] touched me I would accept it." When Byford left the BBC in 2011 his pay-off was made up of 12 months' salary worth £474,500, with a further £474,500 pay in lieu of notice, despite the fact that he had stayed on to work on coverage of the Olympics and the royal wedding. He also received £73,000 for holiday he had not used since 2004. Former director general Mark Thompson, who oversaw Byford's payment, was questioned about the issue by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in September this year. He told them that Byford's pay-off had represented "value for money" and denied current director general Tony Hall's claims that the BBC had "lost its way". Since taking up the job in April Lord Hall has introduced a cap on BBC severance payments of £150,000. When asked by Derbyshire if he deserved his payout, Byford said it was what had been approved by the "appropriate body" at the BBC, the remuneration committee. "I wasn't there, I took no part in it and I was given what I was given," he said. He added that he had not entered into any salary negotiations "since the day I joined the BBC aged 20 on a holiday job". In September, former BBC chairman Lord Grade defended Mark Byford's pay-off during an interview on BBC Newsnight, and said he was a "great asset to the BBC". Lord Grade also suggested that Byford could have prevented recent crises at the BBC, including the failure to broadcast a Newsnight investigation into sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile. However on Tuesday, Byford told Derbyshire it was impossible to say whether he would have handled things differently. "I don't think you or I can answer that with any sense of accuracy or insight, because I wasn't there," said Byford. "As part of my responsibilities [as ....of journalism at the BBC] the most complex and sensitive editorial issues would land on my desk. Whether those things would have been handled in a different way you just can't say." Byford also denied that he had ever heard rumours about Jimmy Savile during his career at the BBC. "I started at the BBC in 1979 at BBC Leeds, his home city, my home area of West Yorkshire. As you said, I stayed in the BBC for 32 years. I never heard any of those rumours or anecdotes or claims about sexual abuse on BBC premises," said Byford. He continued: "Obviously I'm as horrified, disgusted as any other individual or employee at what happened. Obviously the first and primary concern is about the victims of that abuse. "It's absolutely horrific. The BBC has got to learn those lessons and ensure that that kind of behaviour and incident can never ever happen again." </body>

      <body>The Grand Budapest Hotel, the latest film from US writer and director Wes Anderson, will open the 2014 Berlinale film festival in February. The film's ensemble cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Jude Law. Set in a famous European hotel between the wars, it tells the story of a stolen priceless painting and was partly filmed in Germany. Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom opened Cannes Film Festival in 2012. "With unmistakeable Wes Anderson charm, this comedy promises to kick things off in a big way," said Berlinale festival director Dieter Kosslick of Anderson's new film. Its world premiere will launch the 11-day event in Berlin on 6 February, the first major European film festival of the year. Three-time Oscar nominee Anderson has a large cult following thanks to films such as The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and the stop-motion animation Fantastic Mr Fox, based on Roald Dahl's book of the same name. The British-German co-production also stars Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saoirse Ronan and Jason Schwartzman. The off-beat story follows the adventures of a legendary hotel concierge, played by Fiennes, and the bell boy who becomes his most trusted friend. It premiered its first trailer online last month. The Berlin Film Festival runs from 6 to 16 February 2014. </body>

      <description>The challenge of designing a hi-tech wedding ceremony</description>

      <body>Anyone taking a casual stroll around the average wedding fair could be forgiven for thinking that here is a ceremony whose technology has not been updated since the days of Jane Austen. When you consider that the industry is worth more than £10bn a year in the UK alone, you would think the tech giants would be eager to give it a makeover. Instead it is smaller-scale pioneers who are making the in-roads into a sector where tradition still reigns supreme. The BBC asked bride-to-be Ella Williamson to discover how hi-tech a wedding can become. Over the past year, fashion and technology have fused like never before. We've seen the model Dita von Teese step out in the world's first 3D-printed dress and singer Nicole Sherzinger perform in an outfit showing tweets via LED lights threaded into its fabric. So, is it possible to purchase a bridal gown that displays well wishes from loved ones? CuteCircuit, the company behind the Twitter Dress, confirms it would take on such a commission. But its chief creative director suggests a more subtle concoction. "We have made wedding outfits using conductive silver fabric that create a connection when the marrying couple kiss, triggering a private message on the linings of their garments," says Francesca Rosella. The time-honoured ritual of wearing a hat to a wedding has undergone a technological revamp too. Belgian 3D-printing firm i.materialise dabbled with headwear when it launched a millinery competition for designers last year. It now offers two services for creating bespoke headgear - collaborate with one of the company's recommended designers or alternatively design your own and then have it made in the lab. The company's community officer, Tatiana de Wee, adds that 3D-printed "wedding rings, engagement rings and wedding cake toppers" are available too. Merging the virtual world and the real world is an innovative way of getting guests to save the date. So, printing firms have started to offer augmented-reality-enhanced products, allowing invitations to come to life. The process is straightforward - record a one-minute video and send the MP4 file to the company to incorporate it. By holding a smartphone or tablet over the card, the guests can then view a personal message from the bride and groom. Advocates for the tech have claimed it has been about to take off for years - but one of the businesses involved insists the wedding industry is ripe for an AR revolution. "After a slow start 18 months ago, augmented reality printing is now proving popular thanks to increased smartphone ownership, 4G networks and advertising campaigns," Chris Hughes, managing director at Stuprint.com, tells the BBC. No tech wedding is complete without at least one robot. At least Japanese couple Tomohiro Shibata and Satoko Inoue thought so. Their ceremony in 2010 was conducted by i-Fairy, a £46,000 robot by Kokoro. But in 2014, getting married by an automaton should become more affordable thanks to the launch of Oscar the WeddingBot. Oscar is a 2ft (61cm) robot intended to be an officiant, pageboy, usher or speech giver. It uses an Arduino computer as its brain, features a text-to-speech module to talk and a high-definition video camera to see, while the hands were salvaged from a broken Kinderbot toy. "After I completed my first home-made robot in 2012, my friends Mark and Sarah joked about having him at their wedding," says Minneapolis-based inventor Jon Shmig. "I told them I'd make a custom robot and as the list of features expanded I realised that other people may be interested in his services." A prototype was used as a ring bearer at a ceremony in August, and Mr Shmig says he hopes to make the final version available for hire in the US early next year. He adds it will be able to move in time to music - so, be careful that he doesn't cut in to your first dance. With 50,000 downloads in eight weeks alone, Brazil's Boyfriend Tracker app has shown many people want to know their partner's movements. The software secretly sends GPS location and SMS updates about a handset's whereabouts. This begs the question - when will a GPS chip-enabled wedding ring come to market? US engineer Benjamin Kokes has created an engagement ring for his fiancee that features embedded LEDs that illuminate when in close proximity to a specially designed transmitter. But he has doubts about adding a Find My Spouse feature. "I would not rely specifically on GPS - with current technology you couldn't pack enough battery into the ring to have any useful operation," he says. Instead he suggests including a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, which could be detected by strategically placed reader units. For less suspicious but more forgetful nearly-weds, Alaska Jewelry is developing the Remember Ring. The piece of jewellery, which is still at the concept stage, promises to self-heat 24 hours before your anniversary as a reminder. A built-in micro-thermopile would convert the heat from the wearer's hand into electricity to keep its tiny battery charged and its clock running. "We've received quite a bit of interest," says Alaska's Cleve Oines. "But we probably would not launch a GPS ring as GPS trackers and wedding rings are on opposite sides of the sentiment spectrum." If gadget shopping has left you little time to plan the rest of the celebrations, the web can again come to the rescue. American wedding planner TheKnot.com held what's thought to be the first crowdsourced wedding in New York on Valentine's Day this year. Members of the public voted online to select each element of the day - from the outfits to the Modern Ice Castle wedding theme. And if that doesn't sound ideal, you can always Photoshop the pictures. </body>

      <title>German home school families refugees in US</title>
      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. The modern movement started in the 1970s when Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools, says Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <body>The man who invented molecular gastronomy - the adventurous style of cooking popularised by chefs including Heston Blumenthal - has developed a new concept which he claims will solve the challenge of feeding an overpopulated world. French physical chemist Herve This says every foodstuff is made up of a basic chemical mixture - and so it's possible to create nutritious dishes from powders, oils and liquids that contain the building-blocks of food, rather than conventional raw ingredients. He calls the principle Note by Note cuisine and says it is like a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing note by note. The result is food not as we know it, more like being given a chemistry set on your plate. Herve This showed BBC News how Note by Note works, and explained why he thought it was so important for cooking to change. Video journalist: Alain Gales Up Next is a series of video features for the BBC News website which examines the new developments that could affect all of our lives in the future. </body>

      <description>Pakistan Taliban manoeuvres to select new leader</description>

      <body>Somewhere along the mountainous border between Pakistan's militant-occupied tribal districts of North Waziristan and South Waziristan, turbaned Taliban commanders are gathering to choose a new leader of the Pakistani Taliban group, the TTP. The time, venue and duration of the meeting remain a closely guarded secret because the area is known as much for being a major militant sanctuary as it is for the constant buzzing of unmanned American spy planes - or drones - looking for targets. During the last three days, these men have been holding secret meetings in undisclosed buildings in the town of Miranshah and elsewhere in the region to mourn the death of their leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, in Dande Darpakhel - 5km (three miles) north of Miranshah. Pakistan responded angrily to the killing, saying that Hakimullah Mehsud was eliminated just a day before the government was to initiate peace talks with his group. Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan stated that the drone strike had "murdered" any chance of peace in his country. But Taliban elements and their hard line Islamist sympathisers are blaming Pakistan - which had announced a bounty of $470,000 (£293,000) on his head - for collaborating with the Americans to eliminate Hakimullah Mehsud. Taliban officials approached by journalists cite three days of mourning as the reason why there has been a delay in announcing Hakimullah Mehsud's successor. But there may be other hurdles as well. One is the difficulty of movement in a region where drones are always on the lookout for potential targets and there is frequent human intelligence on the ground to guide them to those targets. Telecommunications are also problematic. Pakistani landline telephone networks can easily be monitored by Pakistan, and groups hitting Pakistani targets would be reluctant to use these phones for confidential exchanges. Some mobile phone companies based in Afghanistan provide coverage across Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) and are widely used by fighters operating there. But they have a similar problem as they too can be monitored by Afghan intelligence. The choice of using these communication networks depends on which group can expect sympathy from which country. Another problem concerns the tribal dynamics peculiar to TTP that make the choice of a leader a potentially explosive one. When TTP founder Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike in 2009, the transition to a new leader appeared smooth. Hakimullah Mehsud had established himself as an able deputy who had helped to organise the TTP in nearly all areas of the Fata north of Waziristan, thereby expanding the organisation's boundaries beyond the ethnic confines of the Mehsud tribe. It was his clout among the northern tribes that ultimately won him the top TTP seat - and later helped him garner superior numerical strength to survive in Miranshah. He took refuge in Miranshah from 2009, when the Pakistani army started an operation in his native Mehsud areas of South Waziristan. Hakimullah Mehsud got support from like-minded militants who had also been forced into the area from other northern areas under pressure from the military. That is not the case now. Over the years, Hakimullah Mehsud's policy of favouring the northerners created resentment within his own tribe, and many of the top Mehsud commanders shifted their loyalties to his top rival and fellow tribesman, Waliur Rehman. In recent months, the two groups have been fighting turf wars in areas away from Fata, especially in the country's largest city and financial hub, Karachi, with Waliur Rehman's followers widely thought to have gained the upper hand. But after Waliur Rehman's death in yet another drone strike in May, his deputy Khan Said Sajna was elevated to head the group. He is now one of the top contenders for the post, but he will face tough opposition from Hakimullah Mehsud's group. This conflict within the Mehsud tribe has led to speculation that a choice may be made from some of the more prominent but non-Mehsud commanders, such as Mullah Fazlullah of Swat, Commander Omar Khalid of Mohmand, or Commander Hafiz Saeed of Orakzai. But those who understand the tribal dynamics of Waziristan - and the area's significance as the ultimate sanctuary for Islamist forces - believe a non-local commander is unlikely to hold the respect of the Mehsud fighters, who make up the bulk of the TTP's manpower. For the Pakistani government, this would appear to be a win-win situation. If a non-Mehsud leader is chosen, the TTP is likely to see internal rifts, allowing Pakistani intelligence to infiltrate it more effectively. But if a Mehsud leader is brought forth, he is more likely to be from a group sympathetic to peace talks with Islamabad. Most TTP commanders of the north oppose any peace talks with Pakistan. Hakimullah Mehsud himself was known for his hawkish attitude towards the political system of his home country, calling it "secular" and therefore something to be destroyed. By contrast, Waliur Rehman was considered a dove on the issue, and his successor is believed also to support that policy. Analysts say that if Khan Said Sajna is chosen to lead the TTP, he may in due course come around to holding talks with Islamabad. But in the meantime, one thing is clear. Pakistan has chosen to distance itself from the strike that killed Hakimullah Mehsud. This is perhaps to obfuscate the impression among conservative circles that Pakistanis trapped him by inviting him to talks and thereby causing him to lower his guard. Many remember that his predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, was only targeted after repeated complaints by Pakistani officials that the Americans had avoided hitting him despite being provided with real-time intelligence on his whereabouts. </body>

      <title>Why fate of Jordan Valley is key to MidEast peace deal</title>
      <description>Why Israel and Palestinians both want control of Jordan Valley</description>

      <body>Rows of date palms stand sentinel across the vast, flat stretch of land along the border between the West Bank and Jordan. The view is dotted by dozens of Israeli settlements and Palestinian villages. This is the Jordan Valley, captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War, most of it now still under Israel's military and administrative control. However the fertile, largely undeveloped strip - which makes up a quarter of the West Bank - would form an integral part of a future Palestinian state if the Palestinians have their way. Israel, on the other hand, says it cannot give up the valley for reasons of security. Peace talks which resumed in August are being held in secrecy, but the fate of the valley is said to be one of the points on which Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are struggling to find a compromise. At a Palestinian family farm in Jiftlik the date harvest is just finishing. Teenagers reach up from a platform to shake the ripe fruits from each tree while their elders sort them into crates. The farm's owner, Hazaa Daragma, tells me his date production suffers because of the Israeli occupation. "The Israeli farmer has more benefits than the Palestinian farmer," he says. "He has water and resources. He gets government services and marketing. He sells his dates to Europe. We can't export so we just get a low price in the West Bank." Israel controls all crossing points between it and West Bank, making it by-and-large not economically viable for Palestinians to directly export their produce. Many sell their produce to Israeli companies, or rely on just trading within the West Bank itself. Hazaa's father, Majid, who is in his 80s, remembers better times when he cultivated crops by the River Jordan before the land there was confiscated and turned into an Israeli military zone. "We used to have a lot of land. Now we have a small amount and they are surrounding us more and more," he says. The settlements are widely seen as a breach of international law, although Israel rejects this. The first ones in this border area were set up with national security in mind. The valley is now home to about 9,000 settlers and 56,000 Palestinians. "We are the people that the government sent to settle the Jordan Valley," says David Elhayani, who chairs a regional council, representing more than 20 settlements. "As a Jew, I tell you we can't take any risks. The Jordan Valley has to remain under Israeli sovereignty. I'm not talking about our claims from the Bible. I'm talking about safety. By staying here we protect the people in Tel Aviv and all of Israel." "Something will happen between the Arab countries and Israel, this will be the defence line." Israeli soldiers can be seen on patrol near the border, and there are signposts warning of the presence of landmines. Israeli border authorities also control Allenby Bridge, the only crossing to Jordan that can be used by Palestinians with West Bank ID. The absence of information from inside the talks has not stopped the leaders on both sides from restating their long-held positions concerning the Jordan Valley. In October, on the anniversary of the assassination of one of his predecessors, Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a Knesset meeting, "Our strength is the guarantee for our existence and peace… This requires a security border in the Jordan Valley, as Rabin said in his last speech." Previously the Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had addressed graduates from a new police academy in Jericho. "The eastern borders of the Palestinian state, stretching from the Dead Sea, through the Jordan Valley and the central highlands, to the borders of Bisan [Beit Shean in northern Israel] are Palestinian-Jordanian borders and will remain so," he said. The chief Palestinian negotiator, Saeb Erekat, who comes from Jericho, took foreign diplomats and reporters on a tour of the valley, stressing its economic importance. A recent report by the World Bank calculated that the Palestinian economy would be boosted by $918m (£576m) a year if it could exploit Dead Sea minerals in the southern Jordan Valley. A further $704m a year could be added if it had more access to farmland and water in parts of the West Bank fully controlled by Israel, the report said. The Jordan Valley makes up the largest single segment of what is known as Area C - Israel's zone pending a final peace agreement, as defined under the 1993 Israel-Palestinian peace accords. "In Area C, which is 60% of the West Bank, Palestinians have got to be able step-by-step to develop it," says Tony Blair, who represents the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers and has been working on a Palestinian economic initiative. "Along the Jordan Valley you have immensely rich agricultural land. It's hard to see frankly how in the future you're going to have a Palestinian state that doesn't include that." Mr Blair has been pressing for an easing of restrictions, such as extending the opening hours of Allenby Bridge. "What we've got to try to do I think, even in advance of final agreement, is to give people on the Palestinian side a sense that the world is changing and that they can see the prospect of a genuine state opening up before them," he told me. "Likewise for the Israelis of course [we must show] that the security concerns… are going to be taken account of." In previous inconclusive peace talks, it is said a tentative deal was reached on setting up a few Israeli-manned early warning stations in the Jordan Valley. However Mr Netanyahu is now said to favour a much stronger presence even within the framework of a Palestinian state. Israeli media report that he plans to build a new security barrier in the Jordan Valley and rejects an idea favoured by his chief negotiator, Tzipi Livni, to introduce international forces to guard the border. "Our experience has been that international forces just don't do the job," says Dore Gold, president of the Jerusalem Centre for Public Affairs. He points to the limitations of Unifil, which was given responsibility for the southern Lebanon border after the 2006 war. "Israel has absolutely nothing against Palestinian economic success and there are agreements we can reach so we can share in the economic potential of this area," Mr Gold says. "But giving up the security of the Jordan Valley in a Middle East that's full of chaos? Who knows what's going to happen to Syria - maybe we'll have a new jihad stand to our east - that's a major worry for the Israeli army today." In the Jordan Valley, many residents - Israeli and Palestinian - admit to feelings of uncertainty as peace talks continue. There are regular incidents that highlight the broader struggle over the area. In September, the Israeli army demolished the Palestinian village of Khirbet al-Makhlul. Defence ministry officials say construction there was unlicensed and Israel's Supreme Court had rejected a petition against the demolition orders. However the action was internationally condemned. Human rights groups say it is almost impossible for Palestinians in the Jordan Valley to get building permits because of what they say are discriminatory practices - a charge Israel strongly denies. "When applications are rejected, this is not due to discrimination," a government official told the BBC. "Building permits are in fact granted to Palestinians in the Jordan Valley when proper requests are made... [but] The Jordan Valley is in part a security-sensitive area, since it is a border zone (with Jordan), and this makes certain areas unsuitable for private development." In the village of Abu al-Ajaj, which is still threatened with demolition, an elderly woman, Jamilla Adeis worries for the future. "The Israelis don't want us to live here. They want to kick us out and give the land to the settlers so that they can plant dates," she says gesticulating to the Massua settlement nearby. Although Palestinian labourers work in the settlements, there is an uneasy relationship between the communities. And with the murder of an Israeli settler in the Jordan Valley community of Brosh Habika last month, and the arrest of Palestinian suspects, tensions have only increased. </body>

      <description>Who is to blame for Iraq fiasco - US civilians or generals?</description>

      <body>In September President Barack Obama said, "I was elected to end wars, not start them." Yet ending wars, as he has discovered, can be as hard as waging them. The former US ambassador to Iraq, James Jeffrey, left Baghdad on a hot day in June 2012. He flew away in a special forces helicopter, as he recalls, and looked down at villas and swimming pools. "It was quiet and peaceful," he says. He describes his departure as an "emotional" moment - and says that at the time he felt pleased with the outcome of the war. "We had rescued victory from the jaws of defeat," he says. Sixteen months later, he is less optimistic. One of the main goals of officials in the White House of George W Bush - the ones who started the war - was to build close ties with forward-looking leaders in the Middle East. Today, however, Iraq is besieged by violent factions. And Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki is known for his authoritarian streak. "Iraq is not a natural friend of America," says Mr Jeffrey. These issues were highlighted last week during Mr Maliki's visit to Washington. He apparently asked US officials for military equipment to fight al-Qaeda groups. Iraq has only become more dangerous - and volatile - since the war ended. The question of why things turned out the way they did, with ongoing violence in Iraq, a rise in militant groups, and a controversial prime minister, is complex. Part of the problem, as authors of a new report from think tank Rand Corporation explain, is how the war was brought to a finish. The war apparently ended in the way it was prosecuted - badly. The eight-year war, which started in March 2003, cost more than $1 trillion (£623bn). Nearly 4,500 Americans, more than 178 British troops, and tens of thousands of Iraqis died. The authors of the Rand report say they hope their findings will help officials plan for the next military withdrawal - the Nato mission in Afghanistan ends next year. For the Rand report, the authors examined the final 15 months of Operation New Dawn, as the post-combat phase of US efforts in Iraq was known, as well as the year following the departure of US troops. The authors of the report take a close look at the role of Washington officials during this time. A debate over an "enduring presence", as then-US Defence Secretary Leon Panetta described the troops that could remain in Iraq, overshadowed other questions regarding the war. Many Baghdad officials wanted the troops there - though they found it hard to say so publicly. US officials said the troops would remain only if granted legal immunity. Iraqi officials could not promise that. In the end the US military personnel - and their equipment - were sent home. The logistics went smoothly, but questions regarding the political handover remained unresolved. "Washington let the field drive it, and didn't ask the big questions," says one of the report's authors, Charles Ries, who served as the chief economic official in the US embassy during the war. Washington officials may have shown poor leadership. But so did some generals. "There's plenty of blame to go around," says Boston University's Andrew Bacevich, the author of Breach of Trust and a critic of the Iraq war. Responsibility for the debacle should be shared equally by civilian and military leaders, he says: "I'd probably say it's 50-50." He believes the Iraq war ended badly not because of the reasons that are commonly cited - or not only. The problems ranged from weak civilian leadership to a flawed military strategy. In his contribution to the Rand report, for example, Mr Jeffrey is critical of counterinsurgency doctrine and describes nation-building as a "chimera". These factors contributed to the disastrous end - and violent aftermath. Yet the real problem was not the missteps along the way, says Mr Bacevich, but the way the war was conceived. "We invaded Iraq to change the way the greater Middle East works - and thereby eliminate the source of anti-American violence in the region," he says. "From that point of view the war is a catastrophic disaster." In most wars, he says, the conclusion has been disappointing. World War I was known as "the war to end all wars". The Korean War raged for three years, ending in 1953. Today the two belligerents, North and South Korea, are hardly close. In the Vietnam War 58,000 Americans died. Mr Bacevich says that the benefits of war rarely outweigh the costs. "War is ultimately a political act," he says. "We achieved our aims when the enemy surrendered all but unconditionally." "Conclusive outcomes require unrelenting violence on a very large scale," he says, explaining that the Civil War and World War II illustrate this point. For this reason, he says, political leaders should consider what they are getting themselves into - before they start a war. "Conclusions tend to be messy, and for that reason statesmen should be wary when people tell them that going to war will solve our problems," he says. "It may, but it may not." As Mr Jeffrey says, large-scale change is difficult, and so is winning over a local population. "Those hearts-and-minds things," he says, "they don't work." </body>

      <body>The US state of Kentucky is in the bottom of most national health rankings, and an estimated 14.4% of the state's residents lack healthcare insurance.

      <title>The battle over the legacy of India's 'Iron Man'</title>
      <description>A scramble for the legacy of India's 'Iron Man'</description>

      <body>Is a scramble to appropriate the legacy of one of India's greatest icons a clever political gambit or a sorry commentary on its lack of great leaders? For the past fortnight, Indians have been treated to what many say is an unseemly tussle between the two main political parties - the ruling Congress and the main opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) under the energetic leadership of prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi - to seize the legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, one of the republic's greatest leaders. Mr Modi, who is also the chief minister of Gujarat, recently caused a stir when he said Mr Patel would have been a much better choice than Jawaharlal Nehru as India's first prime minister. Mr Modi also ordered work to begin on a massive statue - and billed to be the 'world's tallest' - of Patel in Gujarat which, at 182m (597ft), would be twice as high as the New York's Statue of Liberty and cost tax payers 20.63bn- rupee ($336m; £210m). A statue which, in the words of journalist Tunku Varadarajan, is vast, tall and giant, in a land of political pygmies". Most Indians know of Patel as a staunch nationalist, who also came to be known as the Iron Man. The son of a farmer, Patel was a prominent Independence hero, a tough-talking administrator and a canny strategist who coaxed and arm-twisted the rulers of more than 550 princely states to merge with India after Independence. He went on to become India's interior minister and deputy prime minister under Jawaharlal Nehru. But his very own Congress party, critics say, has not exactly covered itself with glory while trying to "reclaim" Patel's legacy. Senior minister Jairam Ramesh said Mr Modi's moves were an "insult" to Patel, as BJP's controversial prime ministerial nominee had been "brought up in ideologies that inspired the assassination of Gandhi". (Gandhi was assassinated by a fellow Hindu, Nathuram Godse, who felt that he had betrayed the Hindu cause) Taking a dig at Mr Modi, PM Manmohan Singh said at a function -sharing the dais with Mr Modi at a function - that Patel was a secular leader and that there was a "severe dearth of the values he stood for". Mr Modi is a divisive politician, credited with bringing development to Gujarat state, but also accused of complicity in some of the worst religious riots in recent Indian history. He had his differences with Nehru - Patel was perceived to be more pro-West and pro-capitalist and the two differed on the candidates for the first president of India and the Congress party, and the treatment of minorities. But, as historian Ramachandra Guha says, both were politicians of "conspicuous integrity and were fierce patriots". And despite their differences, he adds, "to Nehru, Patel was more comrade than rival". What prevented a potential fallout between the two, in the words of Nehru's biographer S Gopal, was their "mutual regard and Patel's stoic decency". The partisan bickering over Patel's legacy is felt by many to be a disingenuous attempt by India's main parties to prove that they are the true inheritors of a glorious political legacy. Critics like historian DN Jha blame Mr Modi for trying to hijack a legacy to burnish his own credentials as a muscular nationalist, who has still not apologised for the riots in Gujarat under his watch. Dr Jha told me that it "suits Mr Modi to appropriate Patel as both are from the state of Gujarat and Mr Modi wants to be projected as strong, nationalistic leader like Patel". Many also blame Congress for trying to lean on Patel after relegating him - and other Congress leaders like Independence war hero Subhas Chandra Bose - to the footnotes of history while propping up the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty as its raison d'etre. "The misuse of Patel is the result of the disuse of Patel, the counterfeiting of Patel is the result of the forfeiting of Patel, writes former diplomat Gopalkrishna Gandhi. "The BJP would never have thought of gilding the Sardar's legacy if it had not got dust-laden and cob-webbed in its own home." In this season of "competitive absurdity", one wonders whether all this impress the voters at all - "Both have locked horns on the legacies of the past instead of a promise of the future, even as the 2014 campaign is just beginning," writes commentator Shekhar Gupta. It is not clear whether harking back to the past will endear any party the millions of India's young and restless voters with rising aspirations. "Not a single vote will be cast in 2014 about who would be a better Prime Minister in 1947, " writes journalist and writer MJ Akbar. There should be little doubt about that. And what would have Patel thought about this kerfuffle if he was alive? Ramachandra Guha has the last word. "He might have been first amused, then dismayed, by the Congress's and BJP's pathetic fight for a legacy neither understand," he says. </body>

      <title>Workers await news on shipyard jobs</title>
      <description>Hundreds of workers on the Clyde and south coast wait to hear about their jobs after the BBC learned defence company BAE Systems is to announce cuts at three UK shipyards.</description>

      <body>Workers at BAE Systems shipyards on the Clyde and the south coast of England are awaiting news of major job losses. The BBC has learned the company may cut more than 1,000 jobs at Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow and at Portsmouth. An announcement is due on Thursday on the cuts. It is understood Govan will not close. The job losses are expected to result from a reduction in work for the Royal Navy following the completion of two giant aircraft carriers. Union leaders have said they will hold talks with BAE Systems early next week. Some of the jobs being lost may be offset by a contract to build the new Type 26 Global Combat Ship. But BAE Systems has yet to announce which of its UK shipyards will be chosen to carry out the work. A well-placed source has told the BBC the government was "acutely conscious of the politics of the Clyde" ahead of next year's referendum on Scottish independence. But the Scottish secretary of the GMB union, Harry Donaldson, said any decision should be based on economic rather than political grounds. He told BBC Breakfast: "To be perfectly frank I think it is disgraceful that politicians are getting into looking at these yards as a political football. "It needs to be about communities, it needs to be about people and it needs to be about what is best for Scotland and the rest of the UK as a maritime nation. "I just hope that the politicians can get their act together, think of the future, think of safeguarding jobs and investing in getting these Type 26 orders forward for order fulfilment so we can make a smooth transition. "We may well lose some jobs in the interim, but keeping these yards open, that is the major issue, so people can get the opportunity to come back into employment". He called on the government to bring forward the Type 26 orders in order to create a transitional phase, because: "If you lose the jobs then you lose the skills and the problem is you will lose the ability to then compete in a very competitive marketplace" BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the announcement by BAE Systems would be followed by a Commons statement from the defence secretary later on Thursday. The job losses would result from the completion of work on the building of the two aircraft carriers and from a huge increase in the costs of that project, he added. It emerged on Monday that the UK government was planning to announce that it will need to spend an extra £800m on the carriers, taking the total costs to more than £6bn - double the original estimate. Beyond the carriers there are currently no new orders on the books of BAE's Glasgow yards at Govan and Scotstoun. Any job losses, however, may not take effect immediately because some work on the aircraft carriers is planned until 2015. The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said it would hold talks with senior BAE Systems executives early next week to "examine the business case" of the forthcoming announcement on jobs. General secretary Hugh Scullion said: "Now is not the time for idle speculation or indeed party political point scoring; this is the future of an industry and we need to know from the company and the government directly what their plans for the future of UK shipbuilding are." There are currently 3,200 people employed by BAE across Govan and Scotstoun, and 1,200 employed in shipbuilding at Portsmouth. BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago. A BAE spokeswoman said: "We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Defence to explore all possible options to determine how best to sustain the capability to deliver complex warships in the UK in the future. "This work is ongoing and we are committed to keeping our employees and trade unions informed as it progresses." Shadow defence minister Vernon Coaker called on the government to give "urgent clarification" on the future of the UK's shipyards and dismissed accusations that Labour was responsible for the overspend incurred in building the two aircraft carriers. The Scottish government has said it has been in dialogue for some time with BAE Systems over the future of the Clyde shipyards. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a "very worrying time" and the workforce at both the Govan and the Scotstoun yards deserved to know what the future held. "Scotland is a maritime nation. If you look at countries similar to Scotland, like Norway, they have got much bigger shipbuilding industries than we do so there's no reason why both of these yards shouldn't have a secure, long-term future," she said. </body>

      <title>Taskforce hunts for burka suspect</title>
      <description>A taskforce has been assembled to locate and catch a terror suspect who escaped from his government minders by disguising himself in a burka.</description>

      <body>A taskforce has been assembled to try to locate and catch a terror suspect who escaped from his government minders by disguising himself in a burka. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, who was subject to an order restricting his movements, left a London mosque on Friday with his face and body covered. The Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command, MI5 and the UK Border Agency are now joining forces to find him. He is the second terror suspect under a so-called TPim order to go missing. The terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPim) have come under intense scrutiny since the Briton, who is of Somali origin, absconded from the mosque in Acton, west London. His disappearance has caused acute embarrassment to the home secretary, who introduced the measures. TPims are placed on terror suspects - who officials decide can neither be charged nor deported - by the home secretary. The measures, which need to be approved by a court and expire after a maximum of two years, include electronic tagging, reporting regularly to the police and travel exclusions. They were introduced in 2012 to replace the more restrictive control orders. Mr Mohamed is believed to have close links to al-Shabab, the Somali insurgent group that raided Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in September, resulting in 67 deaths, but officials say there was not enough evidence to bring a criminal case against him in court. Within hours of Mr Mohamed's disappearance, an alert to ports notice was issued. Along with his photograph, it placed him on a Warnings Index Database. While UK Border Agency officers at Britain's ports and airports look out for the suspect, intelligence officers are working closely with the police to try to second-guess where he would be likely to go. One possibility is that he could lie low and stay in Britain. Investigators are considering the probability that he will make contact with elements of the criminal underworld, although he may be wary of exploiting existing links. To stay out of custody he will need a new, forged identity, but he still risks being recognised and having his whereabouts phoned in to the police by the public. If he can make it to Kenya there is a well-established secret pipeline used by al-Shabab associates to pass through the country on their way from Europe and the US to Somalia. The Kenyan authorities may be able to apprehend him, but plenty of jihadist volunteers have used the porous Kenya-Somali border to slip through the net and join al-Shabab. The UK government estimates there are still around 50 British jihadists training and fighting with al-Shabab in Somalia. That number is dwarfed by those heading to Syria to join al-Qaeda-linked groups there. A third potential option under consideration is that Mr Mohamed could flee to Europe. If he can assume a new identity then he may be able to assimilate himself into the Somali diaspora in a European country with a sizeable community, such as Norway. But most Somalis do not want to be associated with al-Shabab and, with his picture so widely circulated, he could again be easily recognised. The open judgement handed down by the High Court on his case last year said the security service assessed him as being linked to a group of six British nationals who received terrorist training from al-Qaeda operatives in Somalia in 2006. The judgement says he also fought on the front line in Somalia in support of al-Shabab, and between 2008 and 2010 was "engaged in procuring weapons for use in furthering his terrorism-related activity". A Home Office spokesman confirmed that if the police do succeed in catching him, Mr Mohammed will be arrested, as breaching a TPim order is classed as a criminal offence. The other TPim absconder, named as Ibrahim Magag, escaped in a taxi on Boxing Day in 2012. He has never been caught. </body>

      <body>A four-year-old who died after being attacked by a pet dog has been described by neighbours as a happy, sweet little girl. Lexi Hudson was mauled at a flat in Rowena Court in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, at about 12:15 GMT on Tuesday. She later died at the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham. The dog, believed to be a French mastiff, died shortly afterwards. The animal came from a rescue home, according to neighbours. Glennis Goddard, who has lived in the cul-de-sac for 27 years, said: "It's a terrible shock. She was a sweet little thing and used to run round here on a bike and knock on my windows. "She used to play with our cats, outside. She wasn't very big, only a little thin thing." Ms Goddard said the dog had been no trouble at all previously and could not understand why it had apparently turned. She said she had been stroking the dog just two days ago after seeing it out with Ms Hudson. "Something must have snapped him," she said. Police officers remain at the scene and the flat has been cordoned off. </body>

      <title>UK visa help for foreign executives</title>
      <description>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get extra help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme.</description>

      <body>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme. About 100 "high value" executives will be invited to join the new Great Club, to ensure their immigration checks are completed "swiftly and smoothly". They will be offered personal support in navigating the immigration system, including their own "account manager". But they will still have to undergo the same checks as ordinary travellers. The 12-month pilot follows criticism that curbs on immigration are deterring wealth creators from coming to the UK. The government has made it harder for migrants from outside the EU to come to the UK unless they have specific skills as well as attempting to crack down on students and family members overstaying their visas. Home Secretary Theresa May said it would enable the UK to maintain a "competitive visa system that can innovate in order to serve the ever-changing needs of business and ensure Britain succeeds in the global race". "We will continue to listen and respond to the needs of high-value and high-priority businesses so that we can provide them with a service that supports economic growth while at the same time maintains the security of our borders." Last month, Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would be simplifying its visa procedures to make it easier for Chinese visitors to enter the country. A same-day business-oriented visa service, currently in force in India, will be introduced in China and other countries. The number of countries benefiting from a priority visa service - which enables eligible applicants to have their applications fast-tracked on paying a fee - will rise from 67 to 90 by next April. Business Secretary Vince Cable and Mayor of London Boris Johnson are among those to have warned against deterring the "brightest and the best" from coming to the UK, amid claims that tougher requirements for foreign students to stay in the UK after graduation are putting many off from coming in the first place. And plans to impose visa restrictions on Brazilians were put on hold earlier this year amid concerns that it would damage commercial links with Brazil's fast-growing economy. </body>

      <title>Investors warned over carbon scam</title>
      <description>Small investors, particularly the elderly, are warned by ministers to avoid a scam involving carbon credits, after more than 1,000 are duped out of a total of £24m.</description>

      <body>Small investors, particularly the elderly, have been warned to avoid a scam involving carbon credits, after more than 1,000 people were duped out of a total of £24m. Financial firms operating the ploy sold investment in the credits, a UN-issued permit that allows a company to emit carbon dioxide, but can also be traded. The market in trading carbon credits is not accessible to small investors. The government's Insolvency Service has closed down 19 companies involved. The Consumer Minister, Jo Swinson, said: "This is a particularly disgraceful scam as it not only preyed on older people trying to maximise their savings, but also targeted their sincere desire to make ethical investments. Instead, investors have been left out of pocket with shares that are either worthless or do not exist." One 90-year-old-man told the BBC how he had been pressurised two years ago to spend £60,000 of his retirement savings on carbon credits - which can be virtually worthless and are a mystery to most people, according to the BBC's personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz. The sales agents travelled from London to Cheshire to make the sale, but he never received paperwork and feels he was targeted because he was elderly. He said: "They came to see me at Macclesfield station, and had a drink... I was very impressed, why should they come all the way from London? "I should have been suspicious, if they're going to those lengths they must have something unique." The man told the BBC he had "invested" £20,000 on European carbon credits and £40,000 on Californian carbon credits. Some of the 1,500 victims were told their carbon credits would be then bought by British Airways and Marks and Spencer. However, the two companies were not involved at all and the investors were left high and dry. Most investors found there was no market for the relatively small amounts they held - as companies that trade in carbon credits only deal in high volumes. The companies included Eco Global Markets Limited, which alone took at least £8.5m from more than 230 investors. It was wound up by the Insolvency Service in July 2013. Two other companies, Anglo-Capital Partners Ltd and Cavendish Jacobs Ltd, which between them took over £1.2m, were wound up in October 2013. Caroline Abrahams, charity director for Age UK, said: "It is despicable that these companies seem to home in on older people as an easy target . "Scams can take place on the doorstep, by phone, on the internet or through the post and the sad fact is that if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is." She advised people who were suspicious of investment offers to take their time to think, and to talk to others, including the police if they thought they had fallen victim to a scam. Age UK has two free information guides: "Avoiding Scams" and "Staying Safe", which provide practical steps to ensure older people are able to protect themselves against this type of crime in their home and on their doorstep. </body>

      <body>Lawyers for the partner of a journalist are due back in court in a legal challenge to his airport detention under anti-terrorism laws. David Miranda was carrying sensitive computer files for the Guardian's Glenn Greenwald when he was held at Heathrow for almost nine hours in August. Mr Greenwald has written about use of electronic surveillance by intelligence agencies in the UK and the US. The judicial review will take place at the High Court in London. The case revolves around the police's use of anti-terrorism measures to detain Mr Miranda, who claims he was simply helping an investigative reporter. Mr Miranda was held under so-called Schedule 7 powers which allow police to question people to establish whether they are involved in terrorism. An earlier court hearing was told that Mr Miranda was carrying tens of thousands of highly classified documents, including information that identified intelligence staff and could put them at risk. But lawyers for the 28-year-old Brazilian say the use of the powers is unlawful and disproportionate. They are expected to argue that Mr Miranda - who was released without charge - was carrying journalistic material and that his detention breached his human rights. Mr Greenwald, who lives in Brazil, was linked to stories based on information leaked by US whistle-blower Edward Snowden. He has now left the Guardian. </body>

      <description>The Army's programme to recruit more than 10,000 additional reservists by 2018 may have to be revised if it fails to deliver the numbers required, the defence secretary says.</description>

      <body>The Army's programme to recruit more than 10,000 additional reservists by 2018 may have to be revised if it fails to deliver the numbers required, the defence secretary has said. Philip Hammond told the Commons Defence Committee the target was "challenging" but he was confident it would be met. The Army Reserve is being expanded to 30,000 to offset cuts of 20,000 troops in the regular Army. A leaked Ministry of Defence memo last month warned recruitment was lagging. The Daily Telegraph reported that fewer than half the required numbers of reservists had so far been recruited in what was described as a "hostile recruiting environment". Under government plans the regular Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, while the Army Reserve - formerly known as the Territorial Army - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000. Mr Hammond said there was "a huge focus on the issue". "We will be publishing quarterly data but I can assure you we are scrutinising weekly reports of recruiting numbers," he told MPs. Asked what would happen if there was a failure to produce the necessary recruits, Mr Hammond said: "If there is a persistent and significant discrepancy, clearly the plan will have to be revised. The plan will not be delivering." Mr Hammond said changes to the programme could be introduced, including improved incentives for reservists and their employers. "I am very confident that we will be able to deliver this agenda," he said. "It will be challenging but nobody ever suggested that the things we are trying to do would not be challenging. We know what we have to do. We will deliver." The Chief of the General Staff, Gen Sir Peter Wall, said that the IT system on which the programme was based had not "got off to the best start" but said the problems were being remedied. He said they were only "three months into a five-year campaign" and so the pessimism from the committee's questioners was "a little bit difficult to relate to". </body>

      <title>IVF success affected by ethnicity</title>
      <description>Asian and black women who have IVF are less likely to become pregnant than white women using the same fertility treatment, UK research reveals.</description>

      <body>Asian and black women who have IVF are less likely to become pregnant than white women using similar fertility treatment, UK research suggests. The Nottingham University team say they are unsure why this is, but say it could be down to genetics as well as social and environmental factors. They looked at IVF success rates for 1,517 women treated in their clinic. Live birth rates for ethnic minority women were significantly lower, the study published in BJOG found. Overall, 35% of ethnic minority women successfully conceived and gave birth after IVF compared with 44% of white women treated at the clinic between 2006 and 2011. This was despite all the women appearing to have favourable chances of having a baby, based on factors such as the quality of their egg reserves. The birth rate also differed between three ethnic sub-groups - 21.4% for Middle East Asian women, 23.3% for African-Caribbean women and 38% for South East Asian women - although this finding was not statistically significant. Lead researcher Dr Walid Maalouf said the reasons behind the findings were unclear. "Further research into genetic background as a potential determinant of IVF outcome, as well as the influencing effects of lifestyle and cultural factors on reproductive outcomes is needed," he said. The researchers say their findings could be used to help counsel couples about their realistic probabilities of success with IVF. Women from ethnic backgrounds might be encouraged to seek treatment earlier to improve their odds of having a baby, for example, said John Thorp, BJOG deputy editor in chief. The outgoing head of the UK's fertility watchdog has also called for greater clarity over the relative pros and cons of IVF. Prof Lisa Jardine said success rates were "discouragingly low" and that those providing the treatment "traded in hope". Two thirds of couples will not conceive after a cycle of IVF. </body>

      <body>A four-year-old girl has died in hospital after being bitten by a dog. Officers were called to a flat in Rowena Court in Mountsorrel, Leicestershire, at about 12:15 GMT to reports of a dog attack on a child. Lexi Hudson was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham where she later died. The dog, believed to be a family pet, died shortly afterwards, but details of how it died have not been released by police. In a statement, Leicestershire Police said they did not believe the dog "was of a breed listed under Section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act". Inquiries are at an early stage and the force declined to give further details. Arthur Nash, a neighbour of the family on Rowena Court, said: "Everybody is in shock at the moment with her dying. "When I saw an ambulance pull up I thought it was an old lady on the court who had had a heart attack and then the neighbour came up and said [the girl] had been killed by the dog." Gloria Longmire , a secretary at Mountsorrel Methodist Church, who walks her dogs in nearby Cross Lane, added: "I would say we do have a strong community here and people will be absolutely horrified and it's dreadful that it's a family pet."

      <body>A British soldier has been killed in a suicide blast in Afghanistan, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has said. The serviceman from the 3rd Battalion The Mercian Regiment was killed "as a result of an explosion during a vehicle-borne suicide attack". The "hugely experienced soldier" had been on patrol in the Kamparack area, 25 miles (40km) north-east of Lashkar Gah in Helmand province. His next of kin have been informed, the MoD said. The soldier's death brings the number of UK service personnel who have died in Afghanistan since 2001 to 446. Spokesman for Task Force Helmand, Lt Col Hywel Lewis, said; "A hugely experienced soldier has tragically died while serving with his comrades in Afghanistan. "He commanded great respect throughout his regiment. Those who served alongside him were privileged to operate with a highly professional soldier who led by example. "Our prayers and thoughts are with his family at this extremely difficult time." The soldier is the eighth British serviceman killed in Afghanistan this year. The last was L/Cpl James Brynin, who was killed on patrol in Helmand last month. British troops are due to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, when all Nato combat operations are scheduled to finish, although a small number will remain in support roles. The number of British troops in Afghanistan was reduced to 9,000 before the end of 2012 and is set to fall to 5,200 by the end of 2013. British troops are now placed at five bases - down from a peak of more than 130 - and rarely go on patrol. Last month, the 7th Armoured Brigade, the Desert Rats, became the last major British force deployed to Helmand. </body>

      <title>Police probe cancer unit 'failures'</title>
      <description>Police are to investigate failures in an Essex hospital's cancer treatment service after reports of bullying by managers and delayed treatment.</description>

      <body>A hospital cancer unit is being investigated by police after staff said they were being "pressured or bullied" to falsify data relating to patients. "Inaccuracies" were found with waiting time data relating to cancer treatment at Colchester hospital, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found. Patients' lives may have been put at risk, the hospitals inspector said. Essex Police said it was looking into whether a "criminal investigation" was needed. Staff told inspectors they were "pressured or bullied" to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines, the CQC said. The findings were reported to police "due to the serious failings identified", it added. Dr Gordon Coutts, chief executive at the Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, said: "We are truly sorry that in some cases cancer patients, their carers and families have not always received the high quality of care that they should have expected from our trust." Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, recommended the trust be put into special measures, which could lead to a new management team being installed or another trust put in charge. He said: "It is shocking to think that people's lives may have been put at risk for the sake of the waiting-time figures." NHS England said it would lead an incident management team of cancer specialists to ensure the safety of cancer patients at the hospital. There will also be a review looking back as far as 2010 to check whether any other patients had their records changed or "inappropriately recorded". The CQC said its inspectors visited the trust in August and September after receiving complaints about waiting times for cancer treatment. It said some patients did not get their treatment within the required 62 days and in three cases delays exceeded 100 days. "Six people described problems experienced in their treatment, including delays in receiving care," the report said. "The provider did not have adequate systems to maintain the safety and welfare of cancer patients." The CQC identified 22 cases where patients experienced delays in their care. Essex Police said it had been contacted by the CQC and was "reviewing information" to "establish whether a criminal investigation is necessary". In a statement, the CQC said: "We found that the concerns raised by staff in relation to changes made to people's cancer pathways were not appropriately managed, investigated or responded to by senior staff of the trust. "Staff we spoke to provided examples of bullying and harassment by the management team in respect of changes of the cancer pathways. "We found that managers did not show clear leadership in a way that ensured the safety and welfare of patients by providing a high quality of care." Royal College of Nursing regional director Karen Webb said: "The CQC report concerning Colchester Hospital does chime with concerns we have voiced on behalf of nurses. "It is right that the hospital is placed in special measures." About 6,000 people a year receive cancer treatment at the trust. </body>

      <body>A Conservative MP has referred himself to Parliament's standards watchdog, while rejecting claims that he offered to set up business deals in return for hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Daily Telegraph reported that Mark Pritchard said he would be able to broker investments overseas using his political contacts in Albania. It said he asked for £3,000 a month for consultancy and 3% of any deal. Mr Pritchard said the allegations were false and he wanted to clear his name. Mr Pritchard, MP for the Wrekin in Shropshire, sits on the all-party group for Albania but there is no suggestion he was willing to support deals in Parliament. In fact he told an undercover reporter that he did not lobby. No money changed hands. Had Mr Pritchard agreed and properly declared a contract of this sort it is not clear whether he would have broken any rules, BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins says. Mr Pritchard said the Telegraph's allegations were false and denied the newspaper's claims, and he was consulting his lawyers. He also said: "I have asked the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate the matter so I can clear my name." </body>

      <title>Heathrow airlines ranked by noise</title>
      <description>British Airways' short-haul services have the quietest planes at Heathrow according to the first list of airline noise performance at the airport.</description>

      <body>British Airways' short-haul services are the quietest planes at Heathrow according to the first rating of noise by airline at the airport. BA short-haul topped a 50-strong table compiled by Heathrow bosses, with Virgin Atlantic's Little Red domestic service the second least-noisy carrier, and Irish airline Aer Lingus third. The carriers were judged on six noise-related criteria. A noise campaign group chairman said he welcomed the initiative. John Stewart of Hacan added: "It is a constructive move to improve the noise climate." Last month a study of 3.6 million residents near Heathrow Airport suggested the risks of stroke, heart and circulatory disease were 10-20% higher in areas with the greatest levels of aircraft noise. The research from Imperial College and King's College London was published in the British Medical Journal. The noise performance scores were based on levels during the period from July to September. Of the listed airlines, 80% met Heathrow's minimum requirements on noise, with 94% meeting at least five of the six categories. Fourth quietest was American Airlines, followed by Qantas, Emirates, American carriers United Delta, Dutch carrier KLM and Deutsche Lufthansa. In last place was Polish airline LOT, with Israeli carrier El Al 49th and Thai Airways 48th. Heathrow discourages noisy aircraft by reducing charges for the quietest. A noise action plan for Heathrow Airport was approved by the government in 2011 following a new European law. The Fly Quiet programme ranking airlines forms part of the plan. Heathrow sustainability director Matt Gorman said: "We are at the forefront of international efforts to tackle aircraft noise and are committed to continuing to reduce the number of people affected by it." Jonathon Counsell of BA said he was pleased that the short-haul fleet had proved itself the quietest. He added: "Overall, we have a noise reduction target to reduce the average noise per flight by 15% by 2018." </body>

      <body>Scuffles have broken out and 11 people have been arrested after protests by the Anonymous movement at Buckingham Palace and Parliament. Hundreds of protesters started a fire near the palace and blocked Parliament Square in the Bonfire Night protests. The demonstrators, many wearing Guy Fawkes masks, were confronted by police, some of them in riot gear. Anonymous was due to hold protests around the world, with similar events in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Linked protests took place in more than a dozen Brazilian cities including in the country's business capital Rio de Janeiro where traffic was brought to a standstill. Activists also took to the streets in cities including Washington, Philadelphia, Berlin, Madrid, Dublin, Warsaw and Beirut. Comedian Russell Brand was pictured attending the protest in London, while Green Party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted that she had taken part. The demonstrations against austerity cuts, corruption and state surveillance were promoted on Twitter with the hashtag #MillionMaskMarch. Protesters said they planned to burn energy bills as part of the events in London. The Metropolitan Police said 11 people had been arrested during the protests. </body>

      <title>Stubbs kangaroo painting stays in UK</title>
      <description>18th century paintings of a kangaroo and a dingo by George Stubbs are saved for the nation by a final £1.5m donation, following an export bar in January.</description>

      <body>Two 18th century George Stubbs paintings, featuring a kangaroo and a dingo, are to stay in Britain after an appeal backed by David Attenborough. A £1.5m donation from shipping magnate Eyal Ofer has enabled the National Maritime Museum to buy the paintings. Commissioned after Captain James Cook's first Endeavour voyage, they were put under an export bar in January after being sold to a buyer outside the UK. They are the first known depictions of the Australian animals in Western art. Kongouro from New Holland and Portrait of a Large Dog were first exhibited together in London in 1773 and have remained in the UK ever since. Stubbs used sketches and specimens to create the paintings in the UK. Both paintings were privately owned until they were sold in late 2012, when they were put under an export bar because of their place in British history and artistic culture. Attenborough, who backed the nationwide Save Our Stubbs appeal, said it was "Exciting news that these two pictures, so important in the history of zoological discovery, are to remain where they were commissioned and painted." A statement from the National Maritime Museum said it was "delighted" with the donation from the Eyal Ofer Family Foundation. Contributions from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Monument Trust, the Art Fund and the public also helped the museum to purchase the paintings, which it says will "greatly enhance" its permanent collection. It already holds collections relating to Cook's three great voyages and these paintings will be central to a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Cook's Endeavour voyage in 2018. The works will initially go on display in the historic Queen's House, which is part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, in summer 2014. The gallery space will be named The Eyal Ofer Gallery. The shipping magnate has supported numerous projects including the new building programme at Tate Modern and the Royal Row Barge Gloriana for Her Majesty's the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. "My family has a long connection with this great maritime institution and these paintings are a landmark in Britain's history of maritime exploration and Captain Cook's voyages," he said. The export licence deferral was placed on the pictures in January by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, who said it was "great news" that the "strange and wonderful paintings will be available to be enjoyed by everyone for generations to come." </body>

      <title>Glasgow tower 'to reopen next year'</title>
      <description>The Glasgow Science Centre tower will reopen next summer, almost four years after visitors were last allowed up it.</description>

      <body>The Glasgow Science Centre tower will reopen next summer, almost four years after visitors were last allowed up it. The 416ft tower opened in 2001 but has been riddled with problems and has been shut for more than 80% of its life. Science centre bosses said a £1.8m renovation would include repairs to the thrust bearing and replacement of the existing lifts. Some of the money will come from a settlement reached with the original contractors earlier this year. The rest of the cost will be met by Scottish Enterprise and Glasgow City Council. When it was built, the 416ft (127m) steel and glass tower, the highest freestanding building in Scotland, was the only structure in the world able to rotate fully through 360 degrees from base to top. However, the £10m tower was plagued by problems from the start. It missed its opening day in June 2001, as well as the visit of the Queen to the science centre a few weeks later. When it did finally open, it was found the glass elevators were too heavy, causing the mechanism to overheat. It then closed for two-and-a-half years because one of the ball bearings which took the weight off the whole structure had sunk. To fix the problem the whole tower had to be lifted on to temporary supports. The ball-bearing problem continued to dog the tower throughout the decade, with numerous lengthy closures. But one of the most dramatic incidents came during a rare period of operation in January 2005, when 10 people, including four children, were trapped in the glass lift for five hours after a cable carrying their lift snapped and the emergency brakes were triggered. The tower has now been closed since August 2010 but earlier this year the science centre announced it had settled a lengthy court action with the contractors and had received "substantial" compensation. The science centre's chief executive Stephen Breslin said he had been working with experts since the settlement to find solutions to the problems. He told BBC Scotland: "It has been a long and complex case but we are delighted that now we have come to the end of that we can focus on the solution. "The good news is we are going to have a tower that is fully operational, as designed, which will be opened by next summer." Mr Breslin added: "The views from the top are spectacular and give a unique outlook over the city for Glaswegians and visitors to our city alike. "As a 'world first', Glasgow Tower pushes the boundaries of engineering and is an iconic machine that Glasgow should be proud of." </body>

      <body>Sinn Féin has described comments about Gerry Adams by Health Minister Edwin Poots as "highly unprofessional". Mr Poots accused Sinn Féin of being more interested in covering up for their "paedophile-protecting president" than serving their community's needs. The comments came during a debate over the ban on blood donations from gay men. The Sinn Féin leader has not responded to the accusations, but his party has said they should be withdrawn. Mr Adams has been accused of withholding information about his niece's sexual abuse by his brother, Liam Adams, who was found guilty of rape last month. During the debate, assembly speaker William Hay shouted "order" and warned Mr Poots to be careful with the language he used, reminding him there was a standard of debate. Mr Poots said he accepted that but added there was a "standard in life that people expect". "When people are aware of paedophile activities taking place they should report it," he said. "And the leader of Sinn Féin, the president, was aware and he believed it and he didn't report it. "So don't come with me seeking withdrawals. You'll not be getting any withdrawal from me on this issue," Mr Poots added. In response, Sinn Féin's Maeve McLaughlin, told Stormont Today that Mr Poots' approach in the chamber was "highly unprofessional". "Sinn Féin will be looking very closely at the transcript in relation to coming to a decision around the next steps, but certainly his behaviour today was not ministerial and was not professional," Ms McLaughlin added. Mr Adams, who resigned as a Stormont MLA in 2010 to stand for election in the Republic of Ireland, was in the Irish parliament in Dublin when Mr Poots made his remarks. </body>

      <body>Police warn residents living within a two-mile radius of a "significant" blaze at a recycling plant to keep doors and windows shut amid fears asbestos could be burning. Officers say the fire at Siteserv on the Llandow Industrial Estate, Vale of Glamorgan, could burn for two days. The fire broke out at 19:20 GMT on Tuesday and 45 firefighters attended. Investigators are expected at the plant on Wednesday. A South Wales Police spokesman said: "The premises ablaze has asbestos in the roof and, as a precautionary measure, residents within a two-mile radius, particularly in the direction of Llantwit Major and Southerndown, are requested to keep their doors and windows closed. "The following premises in the nearby vicinity are likely to be affected and visitors and employees may experience some inconvenience as a result - Powercafe, BPLG UK, Llandow Circuit, Keyline Products, QU paving, and JWB Recycling." South Wales Fire and Rescue said it sent 12 engines and six water ladders. Scenes of crime and fire investigators are expected at the plant on Wednesday. Siteserv was set up more than 16 years ago by brothers Nigel and Philip England. Earlier this year they went on trial at Cardiff Crown Court accused of illegally dumping waste on the site. Nigel, 50, and Phillip, 61, argued they were allowed to fill in a 100m-wide (328 ft) hole to make it more manageable for crops. They were found not guilty of 11 charges at the end of their trial in August. </body>

      <title>£1bn 'vital' role of housing bodies</title>
      <description>More than £1bn a year is being spent by Welsh housing associations with 80% of the money staying in Wales, according to independent research.</description>

      <body>More than £1bn a year is being spent by Welsh housing associations with 80% of the money staying in Wales, according to independent research. It is evidence that these not-for-profit bodies are playing a vital role, said Community Housing Cymru. Housing associations are responsible for growing numbers of homes after taking on council housing stock. But critics argue central or local government can borrow money far cheaper to do the same work. And residents in areas such as Wrexham have voted against moving from council ownership believing housing associations offer less security of tenure. Nick Bennett, group chief executive of Community Housing Cymru which commissioned the study, said: "This report further demonstrates the true impact of housing associations on the Welsh economy and shows that our sector is about much more than bricks and mortar - it also acts as an economic stimulus. "There is no doubt that continued investment from our sector is helping to create solid foundations for a healthier Welsh economy. "In the past year we have pumped hundreds of millions of pounds into the Welsh economy and are constantly innovative in our thinking to continue to invest for the future in order to play an integral part in the Welsh economy and ultimately the local communities we serve." The research, by Cardiff Business School, showed that housing associations in Wales spent £1.034m in 2012/13, an increase of 8.7% from the previous year. With most of that staying in Wales, that amounts to an £840m injection into the Welsh economy through house building, repairs and community projects. Almost a quarter of that was spent building new affordable homes. Pembrokeshire Housing Association has used a new finance model to begin building 12 new houses in Roch near Haverfordwest. It borrows from banks to fund the project while the Welsh government contributes the repayment of the "mortgage". This is the first scheme of its kind in Wales though similar ones are being rolled out. The Welsh government cannot borrow money at the moment but this is expected to change soon following the announcement last week by the prime minister that further financial powers will be devolved to Wales. Graham Holmes, from Pembrokeshire Housing Association, said: "For every £10 we spend on housing, the public purse puts in £3 and we put in, through a private mortgage, £7 - so we can basically build more homes for less public money. "Every housing association has to put in a 30-year business plan to the Welsh government every year and that shows that we are, if you like, a business that can keep going in the long term." Building began at the Roch project in September with the construction contract being awarded to a local family firm, WB Griffiths. Mark Griffiths from the firm said it was important for local companies to fulfil these types of contracts. "As a company we belong to a lot of framework agreements within south Wales and unless you're on the framework you won't get a look at the job," he said. "Pembrokeshire Housing Association [have] been very good to us and we've done a lot of work with them in the locality building a lot of houses." Community Housing Cymru, which represents more than 70 not-for-profit housing associations and community mutuals in Wales, said this showed the impact spending in the sector had on small businesses. The umbrella group for the housing associations also pointed to the additional community work many do. One in north Wales is now providing a meals-on-wheels service on Anglesey after the council withdrew its provision due to cutbacks. But it remains unclear what impact changes to benefit payments will have on housing associations, their borrowing and their business plans. The UK government's decision to cut the spare room subsidy from housing benefit - what critics call a "bedroom tax" - has been linked by some to an increase in rent arrears. </body>

      <body>The cost of a bike hire scheme in Dumfries works out at more than £60 per rental, new figures show. The £155,000 Bike2Go project was the first of its kind in Scotland and it was hoped it could go into other areas. However, Dumfries and Galloway Council is not including the scheme in a planned regional rollout of initiatives to reduce car journeys. Since its launch in September 2010 the bikes have been hired 2,270 times - a daily average of about two rentals. The scheme was set up to encourage people to get "out of their cars and onto their bicycles". It provides bikes free of charge to subscribers at 11 locations across the town. It is based on similar schemes in Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm and one in London which clocked up one million journeys in its first 10 weeks. The Dumfries project has struggled to increase rental levels since it started. After 10 weeks they averaged about 20-a-week, with winter weather being blamed for the low uptake. The council promised a marketing campaign to encourage increased use of the bikes. A poor summer was again blamed for low uptake in 2012. Plans were then proposed to make the bikes available to all council staff when on business in Dumfries. However, some councillors questioned the value of the scheme which has 171 members on latest figures. One suggested it would have been cheaper to buy them all a bicycle and said the project was "in danger of becoming an embarrassment". </body>

      <body>A collection of memorabilia relating to Bolton Wanderers and England footballer Nat Lofthouse is due to be auctioned. The 69 individual lots, with a combined guide price of up to £80,000, are currently owned by the late player's son and daughter. An auction will be held at Bonhams in Chester later. The most valuable item is his 1958 FA Cup winner's medal. Lofthouse, who died two years ago at the age of 85, played more than 500 games for Bolton and won 33 England. He scored a total of 255 league goals as well as 30 goals for England. It is understood the collection, which includes awards, shirts, medals and other items, is being sold by his family as they have no children to pass it on to. Chris Hayes, sports specialist at Bonhams, said the sale had "generated lots of interest already", with the footballer's 1958 FA Cup winner's medal "expected to exceed £12,000". In August, a 9ft (2.7m) bronze statue of Lofthouse was unveiled outside the Reebok Stadium in Bolton. </body>

      <title>Real Sociedad 0-0 Manchester United</title>
      <description>Robin van Persie misses a penalty and Marouane Fellaini is dismissed as Manchester United draw with Real Sociedad.</description>

      <body>Manchester United remain top of their Champions League group, although Robin van Persie's missed penalty denied them an away victory against Real Sociedad. After a poor first half, Javier Hernandez smashed over from six yards. United improved after Van Persie came on and the Dutchman hit the post from Ashley Young's cross before striking the same upright from the spot. Marouane Fellaini was then sent off late on as Real earned their first point in this season's competition. United's Belgium midfielder received his second yellow card for a foul on David Zurutuza, having also been perhaps harshly booked in the first half for a challenge on Markel Bergara. And it ended a frustrating night for United, who still have games against Bayer Leverkusen and Shakhtar Donetsk to come. Having beaten their opponents by an Inigo Martinez own-goal in the previous fixture between the two teams a fortnight ago and Shakhtar Donetsk and Bayer Leverkusen also sharing a stalemate, David Moyes's side may yet rue this missed opportunity in their bid to reach the last 16. They still remain top of the group, a point ahead of Leverkusen, and if they beat the German side in their next game on 27 November, United will progress. Questions will be raised about the penalty as Young appeared to go to ground easily after a tug by Bergara right in front of referee Nicola Rizzoli, but the visitors had only themselves to blame after only clicking into gear in the final 30 minutes of the match. That coincided with the introduction of Van Persie and Young after the hour mark, allowing Shinji Kagawa to move more centrally. The Japanese international came closest to scoring in the first half as he fired wide from the edge of the box and had another effort saved by Real goalkeeper Claudio Bravo. But although most of United's attacks came down their left, they were let down by carelessness in possession and as the half continued the hosts came back into the game. Alberto de la Bella caused David De Gea a worry with a shot from 25 yards but that profligacy was nothing in comparison to Hernandez's miss after 50 minutes. He somehow managed to scoop over from six yards following Kagawa's cross from the left, although it looked like the ball might have bobbled. Van Persie and Young then came on to replace Hernandez and a quiet Wayne Rooney, and the duo transformed the game. Within a minute of the changes, Kagawa found Young, whose cross was smacked against the post by the Dutchman. Van Persie, who is United's top scorer this season, then struck the same part of the goal from his penalty. United almost paid for that as former Arsenal forward Carlos Vela nearly chested in Xabi Prieto's shot following a corner and when Fellaini was sent off in the 90th minute it soured a night where, at least, United took a point back to Manchester.

      <body>Alvaro Negredo's hat-trick ensured Manchester City moved into the Champions League knockout phase for the first time with a comfortable win over CSKA Moscow. Sergio Aguero was the initial inspiration, scoring two and setting up another for Negredo as City scored three times inside the first half-hour to make it a straightforward night for Manuel Pellegrini's side. Having already secured a victory in Moscow, City knew they would be able to progress into the last 16 at the third time of asking if they won again and Viktoria Plzen failed to beat holders Bayern Munich. Aguero's early penalty was followed by a cool finish before a cross for strike partner Negredo effectively ended the contest. Seydou Doumbia did pull a goal back for CSKA before the interval but the outstanding Samir Nasri set up Negredo's second just after half-time to restore City's three-goal advantage. Doumbia beat City keeper Costel Pantilimon, once again chosen ahead of England keeper Joe Hart, from the spot for his second but City were never seriously under threat at any time as they cruised to victory. It was fitting that Negredo, swiftly becoming a cult figure among City's fans and now dubbed "The Beast", had the final word when he completed his treble in the dying seconds with a header from substitute James Milner's cross. City had the taste for goals again following Saturday's 7-0 win against Norwich City and they wasted no time in signalling their intentions against an uninspiring CSKA team. The goals were flowing as early as the third minute when former Manchester United midfielder Zoran Tosic fouled David Silva, Aguero becoming City's highest scorer in European competition with 11 goals as he scored the penalty emphatically. And the striker showed his quality again after 20 minutes, receiving Nasri's pass before turning and scoring with a precise finish. Any notion of a CSKA comeback was banished as the Argentine then turned creator to set up the third for Negredo with a perfect low cross that left the Spaniard with a simple finish. The Russians showed some signs of life on half-time when they opened up City through the middle and Doumbia rounded Pantilimon to score. City, who replaced Fernandinho with Milner at half-time, responded six minutes after the restart when Yaya Toure's lofted pass into the area found Nasri, who unselfishly knocked the ball across the face of an open goal for Negredo to score with ease once again. The only blot on City's display had been some defensive carelessness that might have received greater punishment against better opponents. But as the result of the Plzen-Bayern game went their way, with the German side winning 1-0, Negredo rounded off a highly-satisfactory night for City when he headed in from Milner's delivery.

      <body>England have named Michael Carberry, Gary Ballance and Chris Tremlett in their side to face Australia A in their penultimate Ashes warm-up in Hobart. With one batting position still up for grabs, Carberry opens with captain Alastair Cook, with Joe Root at five, Ballance at six and Ian Bell rested. Meanwhile, Tremlett lines up as third seamer in what could be a possible Test attack with James Anderson, Stuart Broad and spinner Graeme Swann. Cook won the toss and elected to bat. The England skipper had missed the opening warm-up game in Perth because of a back injury, but returns alongside Kevin Pietersen, Broad and Swann who were also rested for that game. It means England are fielding at least eight players who, along with Bell, are certain - barring injury - to play in the first Test in Brisbane on 21 November. Omitted from the team from Perth are all-rounder Ben Stokes and pacemen Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin, while wicketkeeper/batsman Jonny Bairstow and spinner Monty Panesar are the two men yet to feature on the tour. Australia A, captained by Moises Henriques, field a number of players on the fringes of Test selection in a batting-heavy XI. England: Alastair Cook (capt), Michael Carberry, Jonathan Trott, Kevin Pietersen, Joe Root, Gary Ballance, Matt Prior (wk), Stuart Broad, Graeme Swann, Chris Tremlett, James Anderson. Australia A: Michael Klinger, Alex Doolan, Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Callum Ferguson, Glenn Maxwell, Moises Henriques (capt), Tim Paine (wk), Ben Cutting, Trent Copeland, Jon Holland. </body>

      <description>BBC Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth charts his slow recovery from Bell's palsy.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24802323</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70897000/jpg/_70897986_small.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>One year on, the BBC's Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth reports on his slow recovery from Bell's palsy, and frowns, almost symmetrically, at the lack of medical awareness about the condition. It may have taken a whole year, but the muscles on the left hand side of my face have been slowly drifting away from the picket line and getting themselves back to work. The strike, it seems, is over. My left eyebrow, the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do - smile and blink. Shortly after the onset of my Bell's palsy, in October last year, I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter. The response was overwhelming, with many, many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition. So, exactly 12 months on, by way of returning some of that generosity, this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets. Bell's palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight - and unwitting - members of a very strange club. There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they can't move half of their face. Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company, including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan, it is not a club that anyone would choose to join. The paralysis can be shocking and, socially at least, very difficult to deal with. The hardest part for me, as well as the loss of my smile, was the inability to close my left eye. Bell's Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open, unable even to blink, sometimes for months on end. Of course, the other, unaffected eye carries on as normal, merrily blinking away. So, for the record, my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought I'd been winking at them for the past year or so. Except the barmaid in the Nag's Head. That was a wink. The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting. With my left eye stuck open, the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same - in manic two-eyed stare - or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers. Move over Anne Robinson. Thankfully, as the above video shows, at some time between the six- and nine-month mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again. Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus, often at times of stress and lowered immunity, much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed. The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear. Signals then cease to be transmitted along it, paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless. The only treatment that has been shown to have significant, measurable benefit is a course of steroids, but it must be started early, within 72 hours of the onset. These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve. Remarkably, despite this clear evidence, a recent study has shown that many people (more than 40% in the UK) are still not getting the appropriate treatment. And the same study shows that Bell's palsy is more common than previously thought. The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than 7,000 new cases every day. One year ago, as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis, Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity, Facial Palsy UK, which campaigns for better UK services for Bell's palsy and a range of related conditions. "The information available online about Bell's palsy at the moment is pretty appalling," he tells me. "And there is very poor data because there is not enough research." The illness, he believes, is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis. But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take. One patient, a professional musician, is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone. Another, a receptionist, is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public. In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph. As one of the UK's leading experts in the treatment of the condition, Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases: Of course the two questions any new Bell's palsy sufferer wants answered are, "Will I get better?" and "How long will it take?" The good news is that most people make a full recovery - many within a matter of weeks. Something like 70% of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year. Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category. Even without steroids, as my own case shows, most people get back to normal. The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and, by the time I realised how important they were, it was too late. I'm left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them. I'll never know, because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they don't guarantee it. Estimates suggest that up to 30% of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset. Five per cent of sufferers will experience after-effects that are severe and long lasting and, as a result, face the possibility of serious psychological distress. "It may be even harder nowadays," Mr Nduka says. "Face is everything - Facebook, Facetime, Skype. We live in a very image-conscious age." As for me, well I'm almost back to normal, as you can see from the video. I've been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye. But recovery can continue for up to 18 months and the blink, being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve, is often one of the last things to return. Anyway, I'm not complaining. So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement, advice and good humour. You made a difficult 12 months so much more bearable. And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than they'd like, a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more.

      <title>Where have all the Bonfire Night guys gone?</title>
      <description>Fireworks/Bonfire night is still celebrated all over the UK, but whatever happened to all the effigies?</description>

      <body>Fireworks night is still marked in the UK, but Ben Milne asks, where have all the guys gone? "Penny for the guy?" If you're feeling indulgent, it conjures up black-and-white images of cheeky urchins wheeling around a figure made out of tights stuffed with newspapers (and a turnip for a head), cheerfully cadging pre-decimal coins from indulgent adults on a chilly night. For the less charitable, it's a nasty outdated sectarian tradition, where youngsters beg with menaces, before a big bonfire is lit. But making guys seems to have been routed not by champions of understanding and tolerance, but because kids have generally used all their creative energies a week earlier on their Halloween costumes. Guy Fawkes night is still celebrated by a significant number of people in the UK, and firework sales have remained buoyant in recent years. But leaving aside notable exceptions like the town of Lewes, how many of these well-organised and health-and-safety aware displays still burn guys? The decline of the guy is not necessarily down to changing religious attitudes. The occasion is undoubtedly anti-Catholic in origin (a 1677 celebration is said to have burned an effigy of the pope with live cats inside "who squalled most hideously as soon as they felt the fire"). But Roman Catholic opposition to the event has never been very vocal - it's not unusual to find fireworks displays run by RC schools or churches. In fact, fireworks night is for most people just another excuse for a party, and most of the event's political connotations have been sloughed off. In this context, burning an effigy on a fire seems a bit, well, surplus to requirements. In any case, it's Guy Fawkes who has had the last laugh. Having survived centuries on the bonfire, the parliamentary plotter now has another identity. Courtesy of the famous goatee'd mask from the film V For Vendetta, Fawkes lives on as an international symbol of political mischief-making and subversion, recognised by millions who have never heard the refrain, "Remember, remember, the fifth of November..."

      <title>China's three-year-old boarders</title>
      <description>Thousands of young Chinese children are sent to boarding kindergartens during the week, only returning to their parents at the weekend.</description>

      <body>Family ties are hugely important in China, but thousands of Chinese parents are still sending children as young as three away to boarding school. Why do they do it? Kelly Jiang bounces into her kindergarten classroom, her parents a few steps behind. "Bye Mum and Dad," the four-year-old trills, with barely a backwards glance. As her parents wave farewell, she's already happily chatting to her teacher and her classmates. There are no tears, no cuddles and no long goodbyes, which is all the more remarkable, because Kelly won't see or talk to her mother and father for another four days. Kelly is one of dozens of three and four-year-olds sent to this boarding kindergarten in Shanghai. From Monday morning to Friday afternoon she and her classmates play, learn, eat and sleep in their brightly coloured classroom and its attached dormitory, only going home at weekends. They are not alone. There are other boarding kindergartens in Shanghai, Beijing and other major Chinese cities. While no official figures are available, it's estimated that the number of boarding toddlers runs into thousands nationwide. In traditional Chinese culture, family is prized above all else - so how can the phenomenon of the boarding toddler be explained? There are a few reasons, says Xu Jing, executive principal of the Kangqiao kindergarten affiliated to the China Welfare Institute (CWI) in Shanghai. "Some think it's good for the children because it helps promote independence. Other parents don't have time or energy to look after their kids," says Xu. "Also, in traditional Chinese culture many grandparents live with the family, and [because of China's one child policy] sometimes there are four grandparents, two parents and just one child in a home. "Some parents worry that the grandparents will spoil the child, so they send them here." Kelly Jiang's father, Jamie, is an investment consultant, and her mother doesn't work. As part of China's wealthy business elite, they are able to afford the monthly fees of $1,000 (£622). "We did a lot of research, and discovered that boarding kindergarten benefits outgoing children. It helps them become more independent, and have better life skills," explains Jiang. "Our Kelly was a very cheerful baby who liked her own space, so we sent her for a trial. Then we asked her if she wanted to stay in the boarding class, and she said yes." Jiang's eyes fill with tears when asked if he misses his bubbly little girl. "At first we missed her so much. But we think that as the world is more global, sooner or later she will leave us. "We let go of her earlier to help her become more independent and be able to survive in society. But we cherish the time we spend with her." Boarding kindergartens were established in China in 1949 to look after war orphans of the civil war, as well as the children of new Communist Party leaders who suddenly found themselves too busy for childcare. These days, as the queues of Audi and Mercedes cars at drop-off time attest, it is a very different crowd who send their children to boarding kindergartens. Numbers peaked in the 1990s, when sending a young child to such schools was a fashionable status symbol. But recently the system has become less popular. Some boarding kindergartens, both private and state-run, are closing. Others are switching from boarding classes to day care. The CWI kindergarten in Shanghai used to be exclusively boarding, but now only three out of 22 classes for young children are residential. "Chinese parents are now starting to realise that it's important to spend more time with their kids when they are very young, because they are learning and it's a very important stage of growth," says Xu Jing. "We also advise parents that if they have the time and ability to be with their children, day care is a better option." Psychologist Han Mei Ling is a vocal critic of boarding kindergartens, having treated a number of adults and teenagers scarred by the experience. "They feel abandoned and irrelevant. They struggle to find their place in life, and they don't know how to behave in their own family," she says. "It achieves independence only in parents' minds - it is brutal." Han believes a culture where family pride depends overwhelmingly on a child's success or failure is the reason some parents still send their children to kindergartens. "Most Chinese families understand that it's important for children to be with their parents, but they also have very high expectations of their kids," she says. The experience of boarding is seen by some parents as a way for a toddler to get ahead. From boarding kindergarten, they are likely to go on to a boarding school and then, the hope is, they will win a place at a good university. But a number of former boarding kindergarten pupils told me it had been a bad experience. Fashion model Wang Danwei was sent to board aged three after her parents divorced. "In the end I accepted it in a passive way, but I never liked it," she says. "When I later went on to boarding school I felt a deep sense of exclusion, and spent most of my time alone, keeping quiet and resisting getting to know new people." Adjusting to life away from their parents is difficult for nearly all toddlers. During the day, the children are busy with fun activities, but when I made a bedtime visit to the three-year-old boarders at the CWI's Kangqaio campus, about half the class was in tears. Children cried out for their parents in heartbreaking scenes of distress, as teachers tried to comfort them. "We are seeing a lot of tears tonight because it is the start of the academic year, and these children are new to boarding," kindergarten administrator Huang Ying assured us. "In about two months no child will cry at bedtime. The kids also have family photos, so when they need their parents they can talk to the photos and it's just like they are there with them." Mo Li, a 17-year-old student, said she, too, found it difficult at first as a three-year-old boarder, but then had a positive experience. "At the beginning I missed home, but the food was very good, and the environment lovely, with lots of trees," she says. "I think that now, compared to other people my age, I am more independent and more responsible. And you may see this as a positive or a negative, but I also cherish my relationship with my parents more than my peers do."

      <title>Apology over 'plebgate' row evidence</title>
      <description>A police officer apologises to MPs for "inadvertently" misleading them and expresses regret for "distress" caused to Andrew Mitchell and his family during the "plebgate" affair.</description>

      <body>A police officer has apologised to MPs for an "inadvertent error" in evidence to them about the "plebgate" affair. Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police, said he had made an "honest" mistake in a previous hearing held by the Home Affairs Committee last month. He also said he regretted the "distress" felt by Andrew Mitchell and his family during the whole saga. But Sgt Chris Jones, of West Midlands Police, said he had not misled MPs over his disciplinary record. On Tuesday, he told MPs 13 complaints had been made about him but none had been upheld. The two men met MP Andrew Mitchell in his Sutton Coldfield constituency in October last year, a month after the then chief whip had been accused of calling Downing Street officers "plebs" when they refused to let him ride his bicycle through the main gates. He apologised for using bad language but denied using the word "pleb". He later resigned as chief whip as the row continued. After the meeting the officers, who as part of the Police Federation represent rank and file officers in Warwickshire and the West Midlands, told the media Mr Mitchell had failed to give an account of what had happened in Downing Street. But a transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made of the meeting suggested he had provided an explanation - a view endorsed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The two men, who were questioned for a first time by MPs last month, were asked back to correct their earlier evidence. This happened after the committee found Det Sgt Hinton had been "mendacious" over comments recorded in the transcript of the meeting with Mr Mitchell, in which he referred to this "woman that the Conservative Party have". Det Sgt Hinton refused to acknowledge he had meant Home Secretary Theresa May, but he later said he had. Both men said it had not been their intention to mislead the committee and apologised if they had done so. Det Sgt Hinton said he had had listened again to the recording of the meeting with Mr Mitchell and acknowledged that he had referred disparagingly to the home secretary as "this woman". This was clearly inappropriate, he said, and confirmed he had written to Mrs May to apologise. Asked why he had not admitted this in his previous evidence, the officer said he had not remembered the remarks at the time and did not believe they "made sense". "It follows that I inadvertently gave an inaccurate answer to the committee," he said. "There was no intention to mislead the committee. I repeat my unqualified apology to the committee for this inaccuracy." Sgt Jones has been accused of not providing a "full account" of his disciplinary record after telling MPs at the previous hearing that he had never had any official warnings about his conduct. It emerged after the hearing that more than 10 complaints had been made about his behaviour. He said he apologised if he had misunderstood the question but said none of the complaints had resulted in disciplinary proceedings although two - including one that followed an off-duty incident during which he had pushed a fellow officer in the back causing him to sustain a mouth injury - resulted in "management advice" being given. The two men said they were "not indifferent" to the pain that the whole episode had caused Mr Mitchell, saying "each of us fully recognises and regrets the fact that such distress has been caused". But Sgt Jones said he stood by the men's version of what was said during the October 2012 encounter. "I cannot apologise for something I have not done," Sgt Jones - who has been accused by some Conservative MPs of not giving a full account of the details of the meeting - insisted. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the committee, said he accepted the officers' comments but was "disappointed" that they had not given an "unequivocal apology" to Mr Mitchell and his family. He said he understood Andrew Mitchell's wife was in the audience and it had been a "really important opportunity for them to say to her and her family that distress was caused". It was, he added, now up to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to decide if disciplinary proceedings were warranted against the officers concerned after a previous inquiry by the three forces resulted in no action. The chair of the police watchdog Dame Ann Owers said she hoped to conclude its inquiry by the end of the year. The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the hearing had not drawn a line under the affair and that the stakes for the officers were very high. </body>

      <title>Miliband pledging 'recovery for all'</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband pledges to restore the "broken link" between economic growth and living standards and renew his attack on the leading energy firms.</description>

      <body>Ed Miliband has pledged to tackle the "Wonga economy" of payday lenders and move to restore the "broken link" between living standards and growth. Labour's leader renewed his attack on energy firms, and urged water firms to offer special tariffs for the low-paid. The election would offer people a choice whether to "tackle the cost of living crisis or shrug our shoulders". At the same time, ministers have written to water firms urging them to keep bills at "affordable" levels. Labour has made the cost of living its central economic argument since Mr Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015 should Labour win the next election. Four of the so-called "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10%, taking the cost of an annual dual fuel energy bill above £1,400 in many cases. In a speech in London, Mr Miliband said he would force a parliamentary vote on the price freeze plan on Wednesday and challenge Conservative and Lib Dem MPs to back it or set out an alternative. "It is workable," he said. "It will happen if Labour wins the next election. And Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs could vote for it. "If they line up against it, the British people will know the truth. This government is on the side of the big energy companies not hard-pressed families." Research by Labour, he argued, suggests that more than half of the annual increase in fuel bills since 2011 has gone directly to support the profits and costs of the leading energy firms. The "big six" say they have been forced to raise prices because of the increase in the wholesale price of energy, rising transmission and distribution costs and environmental and social obligations imposed by successive governments. They say profits account for about 5% of the average bill and insist they would reduce bills if the cost of green levies - which ministers have pledged to review - were paid out of general taxation instead of being passed onto consumers. Mr Miliband said Labour was determined to reform markets "not working in the public interest" - citing a proposed levy on payday lenders, a cap on regulated rail ticket increases, and a crackdown on private rental charges as well as tax breaks for employers to offer a "living wage". Mr Miliband criticised what he called Britain's "Wonga economy", saying that the rise of payday lenders such as Wonga symbolised the squeeze on living standards facing millions of families. He accused the firms of preying on the vulnerable, creating a "quiet crisis" for thousands of households left with debts they were unable to pay off. His comments came as executives from payday lenders faced questions from MPs, and prompted a strong response from Wonga, who accused Mr Miliband of "rehashing myths about our business". The firm said their levels of bad debt were comparable with credit cards at 7.5% and said that as a "responsible lender we reject 80% of first-loan applications, while the successful 20% borrow an average of £178". "While we recognise there have been unacceptable practices in the sector... we have used technology to bring competition into traditional financial services for the benefit of people across the country." Mr Miliband also called for extra help for people struggling to pay their water bills. New social tariffs for the low-paid, which were introduced on a voluntary basis last year, should be made compulsory, he said. The issue of household bills has become a hot political topic in recent weeks and ahead of Mr Miliband's speech the government wrote to water firms to urge them to "look closely" at the need for future price increases amid concerns about the size of bills and specific plans for a 8% rise from Thames Water, the UK's largest supplier. "We know that household budgets are under pressure, and keeping water bills affordable is a crucial way we can help hardworking people," Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said. "That is why we are pressing hard to make sure customers get a fair deal, by encouraging water companies to look closely at any price increases, introduce social tariffs for vulnerable customers and crack down on bad debt." But Mr Miliband accused ministers of a "make do and mend" attitude to the squeeze on family finances - saying prices were continuing to rise faster than wages and the benefits of the recovery were being "scooped by a few at the top". "We have a prime minister who thinks we can detach our national economic success from the success of Britain's families and businesses," he said. "We have to permanently restore the link between the growth and living standards for all Britain's working people. This government cannot do it. And the reason is because they are wedded to Britain competing in a race to the bottom." The government has said the energy price freeze is a con which will force up prices while the CBI business group has warned Mr Miliband and others against "simplistic soundbites" over prices. David Cameron and Nick Clegg say stronger-than-expected growth, falling unemployment and low interest rates show they have won the argument and Labour's policies would risk higher borrowing and financial instability. Ministers point to recent action they have taken on the cost of living, such as limiting rail ticket rises, freezing MoT costs and pledging to freeze fuel duty until 2015. </body>

      <description>Three single mothers and their children lose a challenge to the government's benefits cap, with the High Court ruling it does not breach their human rights.</description>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <title>Will it be a bleak winter for the NHS?</title>
      <description>Is the NHS fully braced for the months ahead?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24817487</url>
      <date>1383653246</date>

      <body>The NHS knows it's coming, but the big question is whether it can do anything about it. Winter is traditionally the toughest time for the health service, particularly for AandE departments. Waiting times are often at their highest as hospitals struggle to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors with injury and illness. And it looks like this year will be the worst one for a long time. Last winter the NHS in England missed it's waiting time target from January to March as waits hit their longest for nearly a decade. Any hopes that this was a one-off blip have already been dismissed. The summer was the worst on record for many years. The major AandEs - known as type one - missed their four-hour waiting time target during the spring and summer. It prompted Labour to accused the government of overseeing the "first summer AandE crisis in living memory". Doctors are worried too. Bernadette Garrihy, of the College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that staff were preparing for "what may be our worst winter yet". "We have got severe weather problems on the way, increased incidence of respiratory tract infections - things like winter vomiting bugs - we know that this puts our departments under huge pressure." But NHS England's medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh says plans are in place to help relieve the pressure. The government made an extra £250m available in the summer to help this winter. Another £250m will follow in a year's time. This is going direct to the worst-hit AandEs as well as surrounding community services, such as getting pharmacies to open longer. The idea is to give patients with less serious conditions more options other than AandE. Sir Bruce believes the early planning this year will help "decongest" some of the pressure points. But it is clear the problems are much more deep-routed than that. A quarter of visits to AandE lead to an emergency admission, suggesting many patients do in fact have a serious health issue that needs treating and, therefore, cannot be diverted to other parts of the health service. These have been rising since the late 1990s. A National Audit Office report published last week showed rates had risen by 47% in the past 15 years. Of these, a fifth are estimated to be avoidable - that is to say if the patient received better care in the first place the emergency would not have materialised. The frail elderly are the major cause of these admissions, presenting with problems such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. This shows if better support was available in the community there could be a significant reduction in demands on AandE. However, tackling this requires long-term solutions - something NHS England has already recognised as it has set up a review of the whole system. The plans for the future are to be unveiled later this month, but it will be several years before they have an impact. For the time being, those on the front-line in the NHS are bracing themselves for the a long, hard slog in the coming months. </body>

      <title>Could we hatch a British Twitter?</title>
      <description>Why was Twitter possible in California but not the UK?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24816837</url>

      <body>For Jack Dorsey, Ev Williams, and Biz Stone these are heady days. A plan hatched just seven years ago now looks certain to culminate in a triumphant stock market debut for Twitter this week. But I've been gnawing over two nagging questions. How did Twitter's co-founders, who never seemed that sure what kind of business they wanted to build, end up with the right recipe? And why don't we in the UK seem able to produce similar companies? The first question was provoked by reading an excellent new book about the company, Nick Bilton's Hatching Twitter. It paints a picture of three men not quite out of the top drawer of Silicon Valley software types, each with something of an inferiority complex, at least when mixing with all the Stanford and MIT graduates at firms such as Google. Perhaps because of that, they seem even more determined to follow their own path. While they are working together at a failed start-up called Odeo, founded by Williams, the idea of Twitter emerges as a side venture - although whose original idea it is, will become a matter of enduring acrimony. Indeed the feuding between the founders - and in particular Williams and Dorsey - over who should run the business and what direction it should take is on an epic scale. First Dorsey is forced out as CEO, then after months of plotting, he exacts his revenge and Williams suffers a similar fate. The two disagree fundamentally on what Twitter is for - Dorsey believes it's all about sharing your status with friends, so the status update box says, "What are you doing?". But Ev changes that to "What's happening?' to reflect his belief that Twitter has a broader mission as a place to share news. But neither seems to worry too much about finding a business model, and it is only when Dick Costolo is elevated to CEO in the coup led by Dorsey that the commercialisation of the service begins in earnest. That at least is the picture painted by Nick Bilton, and it certainly rings true. The three co-founders have come together again to appear in the video shown to potential investors in the run-up to this week's IPO. Sitting perched on stools they don't look at ease in each other's company, and the video does nothing to explain just why they believe Twitter can make the huge amounts of money it needs to justify an ever higher valuation. But, by accident or design, they have built a global audience and are now starting to convince advertisers that Twitter can offer them a smart way to connect with customers. So many things have gone wrong along the way, from the internal feuding to the constant technology problems that took the site offline for hours or even days at a time, that it seems a miracle that it has come so far. Which brings me to my second question: Why was Twitter possible in California but not in the UK? From ARM to Mind Candy, we do produce successful tech firms, but nothing that grows so far and so fast as a Twitter or a Facebook. We have people just as talented as Dorsey or Stone, but somehow they never get quite as far. Apart from the important fact that it provides a huge market for any start-up, the other answer for me is that the US, and Silicon Valley in particular, is still a place where optimism rules and anything feels possible. Despite all the setbacks and disagreements, the Twitter trio and their venture capital backers remained profoundly positive about their belief that their technology could change the world. Here in the UK, our first reaction to anything new is too often a furrowed brow or a dismissive sneer rather than a "Wow, that's cool!" Even for the most optimistic entrepreneur it is difficult to keep going when everyone is telling you that you're doomed to fail. The sad truth is that most tech start-ups will fail to meet their founders' expectations - but unless we believe that there is a chance that just a few will make it big, then we're unlikely to hatch a British Twitter. </body>

      <title>'Warne trying to provoke Cook - but it won't work'</title>
      <description>Alastair Cook should be judged on results, says Alec Stewart</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/24806559</url>
      <date>1383633392</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70905000/jpg/_70905188_70904823.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Shane Warne has started the traditional pre-Ashes war of words by claiming that England will lose the series down under unless Alastair Cook captains the team in a more imaginative manner. While I have the utmost respect for one of Australia's finest cricketers, I prefer to judge people on outcomes rather than methods and England's results since Cook took command suggest he is doing a very good job. Cook has won four of his five series in charge, including a historic triumph away in India and a 3-0 win in last summer's Ashes series. In 16 Tests, he has lost just once. The England opener is fortunate enough to have a very strong group of players at his disposal, allowing him to continue with a method that is tried and trusted. It may not always produce the most thrilling cricket, but who cares about that if it results in a victory? Warne contrasts Cook's approach with the styles of Australia skipper Michael Clarke and New Zealand captains past and present Stephen Fleming and Brendon McCullum. And although it is possibly true that those three are generally more inventive than Cook in their field placings and bowling changes, I would argue they have to be because of the lesser calibre of player at their disposal. If you are always chasing the game and searching for something to happen, as Clarke usually was during the summer Ashes series, you have to gamble and think outside of the box. Cook, on the other hand, knows more often than not, if his side remains patient then one or more of his many proven match-winners will put their hand up and turn the match in England's favour. This was the case in the Durham Test when Stuart Broad turned the game with that devastating spell of bowling. I fully expect that approach to pay dividends again down under because England remain a considerably stronger unit than their Aussie counterparts, but that is not to say there won't be periods when the hosts are on top. If and when that happens, I have no doubt that Cook will have what it takes to try something different. He is a quick learner who has an excellent cricket brain. From the moment he walked into the England team and scored a hundred on debut against India in Nagpur at the age of 21 he has impressed me with everything he has done. Like all captains, he will constantly be asking himself: 'How can we win this match?' 'What gives my team the best opportunity of winning this day, this session, this hour, this over, this ball?' And if that means diverting from his current methods, then I'm sure he will not hesitate to do it. Cook's duties in Australia will not just be confined to the field of play. On a long tour, the captain has a vital man-management role, making sure each individual is fully aware of what their responsibilities are and that they are in the best frame of mind possible for the matches. One of the hardest tasks is telling a player they are being left out. Not only do you have to convey the bad news, but you have to keep an eye on that player for the next couple of days, to keep their spirits up and make sure they still feel part of the group. I remember having to inform Angus Fraser he was being dropped for the Perth Test in the 1998-99 Ashes. It was tough telling a mate and an experienced player that he wasn't playing but it was something I had to do, and I hope he respected me for being honest with him about the reasons for the decision. Judging by the glowing terms in which Cook is spoken in by his team-mates and the England coaching staff, he is doing as good a job off the field as he is on it. Warne's latest barb may well have been designed to try to provoke a reaction from Cook, to get him to change the way England play their cricket to the benefit of Australia. But while the leg-spinner was too often England's tormenter on the field of play, there is very little damage he can do from the confines of the commentary box and his newspaper columns. And if Cook continues to captain in the way that has already brought so much success, while always staying ahead of the game, then I fully expect him to be lifting the Ashes urn again in January, if not before. I'm very confident that Cook's actions will speak louder than Warne's words. Alec Stewart was speaking to BBC Sport's Sam Sheringham </body>

      <body>The police investigation into claims that staff at Colchester Hospital were bullied into falsifying records of cancer patients makes the lead for the Guardian and the Daily Mail. The Guardian says the matter is threatening to emerge as another major scandal for the NHS. The Mail tells the story of a four-year-old boy who died of a brain tumour after what it calls a series of appalling delays to his treatment. It has a picture of the Duchess of Cambridge visiting Mackenzie Cackett two months before he died. There is more uncomfortable reading for NHS staff and patients alike amid warnings of a "winter crisis". The Times, in its main story, reports that hospitals are at bursting point. It says a huge rise in the number of frail elderly patients going into hospital means admissions are a third higher than a decade ago. Leader columns demand swift action. The Daily Mirror urges Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to listen to doctors and nurses and divert resources to where it is most needed. For the Sun, the root of the overcrowding at casualty departments is Labour's decision to allow GPs to opt out of working in the evenings and at weekends. It says Mr Hunt must insist on seven-day working at GPs' surgeries - and provide the money to do it. In the words of the Daily Star, ministers need to hire more staff, pump emergency funds into cash-strapped AandE departments and ensure proper plans are drawn up to tackle the crisis. The Daily Mirror leads on the fatal attack on a four-year-old girl in Leicestershire by her pet dog. According to the paper, the normally placid French mastiff suddenly leapt at Lexi Hudson who had been taking a mid-day nap after being off sick from school. Her mother frantically wrestled with the dog to try to get it off her then grabbed a knife and stabbed it to death. The paper adds that the family had picked up the dog from a rescue centre two months ago. According to the Sun's main story, two students entered a Halloween fancy dress contest - as the blazing Twin Towers. It says the 19-year-old girls shockingly won the competition, which was held at a nightclub in Chester. The paper says each of their outfit, based on the 9/11 terror attacks, featured explosions, flames, and even people jumping from windows. The paper has the headline "Towering stupidity". Finally, a property in Plymouth has been declared Britain's biggest student house. The Daily Express says the house, made up of four large Victorian terraced properties knocked into one, is home to 32 undergraduates at Plymouth University. They share 22 toilets, seven shower cubicles and three kitchens. According to the Times, they get through 100 cans of baked beans, 50 Pot Noodles, 150 takeaways and 500 cans of lager every week. Thankfully, the Daily Telegraph says, the property's private landlord employs a team of three cleaners six days a week to clear up. </body>

      <description>Microsoft warns that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has warned that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers. It said attackers could exploit this by requesting users to preview or open a specially crafted email or web content. Microsoft said it was "aware of targeted attacks" and was investigating. The issue affects Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Office 2003 - 2010, and Microsoft Lync. The current versions of Microsoft Windows and Office are not affected by the issue - which centres on a graphics component. Microsoft said it would take appropriate action to address the issue, which "may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs". In the meantime, it has advised customers to apply workarounds - a setting or configuration change that "does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available". According to Microsoft, the flaw lies in the handling of the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image files by a graphics processing component in the affected software versions. In a blog post on the Microsoft Security Response Centre, Dustin Childs a communications manager, said any move by hackers "requires user interaction". He said that the attacks are disguised as an email requesting potential targets to open a specially crafted Word attachment. If the attachment is opened or previewed, it attempts to exploit the issue using a malformed graphics image embedded in the document. "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user," Mr Childs said. Microsoft added that hackers could also exploit the issue via a web-based attack. "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website," it said. However, it added that an attacker would have "no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content". "Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website." </body>

      <title>BAE Systems to cut UK shipyards jobs</title>
      <description>BAE Systems is to cut potentially more than 1,000 jobs from three of its UK shipyards at Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow and at Portsmouth.</description>

      <body>BAE Systems is to cut potentially more than 1,000 jobs from three of its UK shipyards at Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow and at Portsmouth. The BBC has learned that major job losses at the yards will be announced by the company later this week. Some of the jobs being lost may be offset by a contract to build the new Type 26 Global Combat Ship. BAE Systems, however, has yet to announce which of its UK shipyards will be chosen to carry out the work. BBC Political Editor Nick Robinson said the announcement by BAE Systems is expected on Thursday morning and will be followed later that day by a Commons statement from the defence secretary. He understands that BAE's Govan shipyard will not close despite the fact that the possibility has been discussed behind the scenes in recent weeks. He said a well-placed source had told him that the UK government was "acutely conscious of the politics of the Clyde" ahead of next year's referendum on Scottish independence. The job losses, he said, would result from the completion of work on the building of two new aircraft carriers and from a huge increase in the costs of that project. It emerged on Monday that the UK government is planning to announce that it will need to spend an extra £800m on the carriers, taking the total costs to more than £6bn - double the original estimate. Beyond the carriers there are currently no new orders on the books of the BAE's Glasgow yards at Govan and Scotstoun. Any job losses, however, may not take effect immediately because some work on the aircraft carriers is planned until 2015. There are currently 3,200 people employed by BAE across Govan and Scotstoun, and 1,200 employed in shipbuilding at Portsmouth. BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago. A BAE spokeswoman said: "We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Defence to explore all possible options to determine how best to sustain the capability to deliver complex warships in the UK in the future. "This work is ongoing and we are committed to keeping our employees and trade unions informed as it progresses." The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said it would hold talks with senior BAE systems executives early next week to "examine the business case" of the forthcoming announcement on jobs. General Secretary Hugh Scullion said: "Now is not the time for idle speculation or indeed party political point scoring, this is the future of an industry and we need to know from the company and the government directly what their plans for the future of UK shipbuilding are. "The shipbuilding workforce throughout the UK are working flat out to deliver the aircraft carriers for the defence of the UK and they need to know what lies in store for them, their families and their communities." Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the workforce at both the Govan and the Scotstoun yards in Glasgow deserved to know what the future holds. "Scotland is a maritime nation. If you look at countries similar to Scotland, like Norway, they have got much bigger shipbuilding industries than we do so there's no reason why both of these yards shouldn't have a secure, long-term future," she said. "This is a very worrying time. Any talk of perhaps hundreds of job losses is of real concern to the people employed in these yards and right now the most important thing is for them to be given clarity." The shadow defence minister called on the government for "urgent clarification" on the future of the UK's shipyards. Vernon Coaker said: "What many people will want across the shipyards mentioned is some clarity and certainty about what actually is being proposed. "It is important the government and BAE Systems come forward with what are the facts as soon as possible. "There are thousands of workers and families wondering what their future holds." He said it was important that the UK maintained the "skills and capacity" to continue shipbuilding, which is "important for (the) defence of our country". Mr Coaker said BAE and the unions involved "work very closely" and "have a good relationship", and will be working together to ensure the UK maintains a ship building industry. He also dismissed accusations that Labour was responsible for the overspend incurred in building the two aircraft carriers. Gerald Vernon-Jackson, leader of Portsmouth City Council, said the council would "work as hard as we can" to save jobs at the Portsmouth shipyard. He said there were "question marks" over the yard and its future was a "strategic decision" for the defence of the UK. "If all the British warship manufacturing is in Scotland, what happens in less than a year if Scotland is independent?" he said. Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said the Scottish government had "been in dialogue for some time" with BAE Systems on the issues surrounding the future of the Clyde shipyards. Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael said it was "no secret" that BAE was carrying out a review of its defence work but he warned against speculation. "It is absolutely no secret that there is a review ongoing," he said. "And it is quite possible that there will be an early conclusion to that but unless, and until, we are dealing in facts rather than speculation then for the people whose jobs are concerned then there is no usefulness in this at all." Scottish Labour leader Johann Lamont, whose Glasgow Pollok constituency includes the Govan yard, said: "Everything must be done to ensure shipbuilding on the Clyde continues. "The UK government is the Clyde's biggest customer and I will be seeking urgent talks to make sure that continues. "This will be a particularly worrying time for the workforce and their families but I will work with anyone to make sure we can keep these jobs. "It's times like these that we all need to come together, put differences aside and fight to secure these vital jobs." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, who is a Glasgow MSP, said: "The current speculation over shipyard jobs is unhelpful and destabilising to both the workforce and their families. "BAE's shipbuilders on the Clyde are a highly professional, motivated and loyal workforce and they deserve clear answers from the company about their future." </body>

      <title>Toyota raises yearly profit forecast</title>
      <description>The world's biggest carmaker, Toyota, raises its profit forecast as the yen's weakness and cost cutting measures help lift its earnings.</description>

      <body>The world's biggest carmaker, Toyota, has raised its profit forecast as the yen's weakness and cost-cutting measures helped lift its earnings. It now expects to make a net profit of 1.67tn yen ($16.9bn; £10.5bn) in the financial year to 31 March 2014, up from an earlier forecast of 1.48tn yen. Toyota upped the forecast as it reported a net profit of 1tn yen for the six months to the end of September. The results are in contrast with Nissan which cut its profit outlook last week. Toyota said it expects to sell 9.1 million vehicles in the current financial year and generate a revenue of 25tn yen during the period. Japanese carmakers, including Toyota, rely heavily on sales in foreign markets. As a result, any fluctuation in the currency markets has an impact on their profitability. Over the past year Japanese carmakers have benefited from the decline in the yen's value - which makes their cars more affordable for foreign buyers and also boosts their profits when they repatriate their foreign earnings back home. The Japanese currency had fallen nearly 25% against the US dollar since November last year after the new government unveiled a series of aggressive policies aimed at spurring Japan's economy. Toyota said the fluctuation on the currency resulted in an increase of 540bn yen in its operating profit during the April-to-September period. It made an operating profit of 1.25tn yen during the period compared with 694bn yen last year. "In addition to the impact of the weaker yen, operating income increased due to our efforts with our suppliers and distributors for profit improvement through cost reduction and marketing activities, such as enhancement of the model mix," said Nobuyori Kodaira, an executive vice president with Toyota. Toyota has staged a remarkable recovery over the past two years after its business was impacted by the earthquake and tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011. It has since reclaimed the top spot as the world's biggest carmaker from US rival General Motors. Its sales in the US - its biggest market - have also been on the rise, helped in part by an overall recovery in the US car market. But a spate of recalls have hampered its recovery. Toyota has called back more than 20 million vehicles over the past two years for a variety of problems. The recalls have been mostly voluntary, and there have been no major crashes involved, but analysts have warned of their negative impact on Toyota's reputation. </body>

      <description>Apple reveals details of requests it has received from governments across the globe to share customer data.</description>

      <body>Apple has revealed details of requests it has received from governments across the globe to share customer data. The US government, which made between 1,000 and 2,000 requests in the six months to 30 June, topped the list. The firm said the US requests affected 2,000 to 3,000 accounts, adding it gave out data on zero to 1,000 accounts. Apple said the most common "requests involve robberies and other crimes or requests from law enforcement officers searching for missing persons". It said the response usually involves disclosing information about an account holder's iTunes or iCloud account "such as a name and an address". "In very rare cases, we are asked to provide stored photos or email. We consider these requests very carefully and only provide account content in extremely limited circumstances," the firm said. The UK was second on the list, with 127 requests. Spain, Germany and Australia also featured in the top five. The tech giant added that since its main business was "not about collecting information", the vast majority of requests it received from law enforcement agencies were about information on "lost or stolen devices". The company logs these requests under a separate category as "device requests" which, it said, "never include national security-related requests". Apple received more than 3,500 such requests in the US between January and June this year. Apple also used the report to call for more freedom to disclose the details of such requests to customers. It said that currently the US government did not allow it to disclose "except in broad ranges, the number of national security orders, the number of accounts affected by the orders, or whether content, such as emails, was disclosed". "We strongly oppose this gag order," it added. It said it had asked the government to ease these restrictions but so far had not seen any major changes. "Despite our extensive efforts in this area, we do not yet have an agreement that we feel adequately addresses our customers' right to know how often and under what circumstances we provide data to law enforcement agencies". Earlier this year, Google, Facebook and Microsoft asked the US government to allow them to disclose the security requests they receive to hand over user data. The move by these companies came after leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed mass surveillance programmes by the National Security Agency (NSA) and associated agencies. Apple said it had filed a letter with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court supporting a group of cases requesting greater transparency. "We will continue to aggressively pursue our ability to be more transparent." </body>

      <body>Indonesia's economy expanded at its weakest rate in four years in the third quarter as a result of slowing exports and subdued domestic demand. Its economy grew 5.6% in the July-to-September period from a year earlier, down from 5.8% in the previous quarter. Indonesia's exports have been hurt by slowing demand from key markets and a drop in commodity prices. Meanwhile, domestic demand has been impacted by rising fuel prices and rising interest rates. Fuel prices in the country surged earlier this year after the government removed its subsidy programme. Petrol prices went up by 44% while diesel prices rose by 22%, leading to higher transportation costs and electricity bills. Indonesia, like many other emerging economies, was also hurt after investors withdrew money from emerging markets earlier this year. The pullout was triggered by growing speculation that the US central bank will start to taper off its key stimulus programme and start raising interest rates sooner than previously thought. In Indonesia's case, concerns of slowing economic growth and a widening current account deficit further contributed to that pull out. All of this has hurt the Indonesian currency which has dipped nearly 17% against the US dollar since May this year. A weak currency coupled with rising consumer prices has resulted in the central bank raising the cost of borrowing in the country. The latest raise in September saw the key rate rise to 7.25%, the highest level in more than four years. Analysts said that the combination of all these factors had hurt domestic consumption and impacted growth. In September, the country's central bank also lowered its growth forecast. It now expects the economy to grow by 5.5-5.9% compared with its earlier projection of growth of 5.8-6.2%. </body>

      <description>Fears about disruption to next year's World Cup are raised as the key global football conference Soccerex is cancelled by the Rio authorities.</description>

      <body>Fears about disruption to next year's World Cup have been raised after the key global football conference Soccerex was cancelled because of continuing civil unrest. It was due to start in just three weeks time at the Maracana stadium. The England manager, Roy Hodgson, was among a number of high-profile figures who were planning to attend the event. The organisers and Rio's state government disagreed over why the event is being called off. In a statement, the organisers said the government took the decision because of "ongoing civil unrest" in Brazil. This was later "strongly denied" by the state government of Rio, citing instead funding problems. "The governor says he encouraged the organisers to seek cultural and sports incentive funding to finance the event, but the organisers failed to do so," it said in a statement read out by Fifa's head of media at a news conference in London. The event would have been the last of four scheduled Soccerex conventions to be held in Rio. The organisers said they would be taking legal action against the Rio authorities responsible. "Preparations for the event at the Maracana Stadium were well advanced with content planned, speakers confirmed and partnerships in place," a statement said. "To be summarily cancelled in such a cavalier fashion, having hosted 33 events over five continents is extremely frustrating but nevertheless it has happened and is in contravention of all of the contractual obligations of the Rio State Government, who have been notified of our intention to instigate legal proceedings for substantial compensation." Soccerex chief executive Duncan Revie called the cancellation "cruel" and said he wanted to apologise to "every business, football club, league, federation and media organisation affected by this news". Despite the sudden cancellation, world football governing body Fifa said it did not suggest heightened security fears for the World Cup. Fifa's marketing director, Thierry Weil, said: "We do not believe this will have any influence in any way or form on the organisation of the Fifa World Cup." Brazil, one of the fast-growing Brics nations, has seen its growth rate fall far from the 7.5% recorded in 2010 and is now growing at just short of 3% a year. That, and a sharp fall in the value of its currency, the real, has sparked a number of often violent anti-government protests this year. Among the protesters' concerns are corruption in public life as well as spending on hosting the World Cup and Olympics. People are also asking for more investment in public services, better public schools, hospitals and transportation. These demonstrations affected the Confederations Cup in June, prompting fears about safety and security for next summer's World Cup finals. Soccerex has been running for the last 18 years. It brings together football federations and associations, major clubs, rights holders, leading brands, businessmen and others in the industry. Next year it moves to Manchester in the UK, which has been the host of Soccerex Europe since 2010. </body>

      <title>Investors warned over carbon scam</title>
      <description>Small investors, particularly the elderly, are warned by ministers to avoid a scam involving carbon credits, after more than 1,000 are duped out of a total of £24m.</description>

      <body>Small investors, particularly the elderly, have been warned to avoid a scam involving carbon credits, after more than 1,000 people were duped out of a total of £24m. Financial firms operating the ploy sold investment in the credits, a UN-issued permit that allows a company to emit carbon dioxide, but can also be traded. The market in trading carbon credits is not accessible to small investors. The government's Insolvency Service has closed down 19 companies involved. The Consumer Minister, Jo Swinson, said: "This is a particularly disgraceful scam as it not only preyed on older people trying to maximise their savings, but also targeted their sincere desire to make ethical investments. Instead, investors have been left out of pocket with shares that are either worthless or do not exist." One 90-year-old-man told the BBC how he had been pressurised two years ago to spend £60,000 of his retirement savings on carbon credits - which can be virtually worthless and are a mystery to most people, according to the BBC's personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz. The sales agents travelled from London to Cheshire to make the sale, but he never received paperwork and feels he was targeted because he was elderly. He said: "They came to see me at Macclesfield station, and had a drink... I was very impressed, why should they come all the way from London? "I should have been suspicious, if they're going to those lengths they must have something unique." The man told the BBC he had "invested" £20,000 on European carbon credits and £40,000 on Californian carbon credits. Some of the 1,500 victims were told their carbon credits would be then bought by British Airways and Marks and Spencer. However, the two companies were not involved at all and the investors were left high and dry. Most investors found there was no market for the relatively small amounts they held - as companies that trade in carbon credits only deal in high volumes. The companies included Eco Global Markets Limited, which alone took at least £8.5m from more than 230 investors. It was wound up by the Insolvency Service in July 2013. Two other companies, Anglo-Capital Partners Ltd and Cavendish Jacobs Ltd, which between them took over £1.2m, were wound up in October 2013. Caroline Abrahams, charity director for Age UK, said: "It is despicable that these companies seem to home in on older people as an easy target . "Scams can take place on the doorstep, by phone, on the internet or through the post and the sad fact is that if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is." She advised people who were suspicious of investment offers to take their time to think, and to talk to others, including the police if they thought they had fallen victim to a scam. Age UK has two free information guides: "Avoiding Scams" and "Staying Safe", which provide practical steps to ensure older people are able to protect themselves against this type of crime in their home and on their doorstep. </body>

      <title>UK visa help for foreign executives</title>
      <description>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get extra help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme.</description>

      <body>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme. About 100 "high value" executives will be invited to join the new Great Club, to ensure their immigration checks are completed "swiftly and smoothly". They will be offered personal support in navigating the immigration system, including their own "account manager". But they will still have to undergo the same checks as ordinary travellers. The 12-month pilot follows criticism that curbs on immigration are deterring wealth creators from coming to the UK. The government has made it harder for migrants from outside the EU to come to the UK unless they have specific skills as well as attempting to crack down on students and family members overstaying their visas. Home Secretary Theresa May said it would enable the UK to maintain a "competitive visa system that can innovate in order to serve the ever-changing needs of business and ensure Britain succeeds in the global race". "We will continue to listen and respond to the needs of high-value and high-priority businesses so that we can provide them with a service that supports economic growth while at the same time maintains the security of our borders." Last month, Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would be simplifying its visa procedures to make it easier for Chinese visitors to enter the country. A same-day business-oriented visa service, currently in force in India, will be introduced in China and other countries. The number of countries benefiting from a priority visa service - which enables eligible applicants to have their applications fast-tracked on paying a fee - will rise from 67 to 90 by next April. Business Secretary Vince Cable and Mayor of London Boris Johnson are among those to have warned against deterring the "brightest and the best" from coming to the UK, amid claims that tougher requirements for foreign students to stay in the UK after graduation are putting many off from coming in the first place. And plans to impose visa restrictions on Brazilians were put on hold earlier this year amid concerns that it would damage commercial links with Brazil's fast-growing economy. </body>

      <body>Payday lenders are divided over a plan to limit the number of rollovers of short-term, high-interest loans, MPs have heard. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has proposed a limit of two extensions of payday loans if borrowers chose not to repay. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has suggested that one rollover was a sign that a borrower was in difficulty. But lenders told MPs that rollovers were suitable in some cases. Payday lending is being put under the microscope by MPs amid a defence from some of the industry's biggest players. Members of the Business Select Committee quizzed lenders, consumer groups, regulators and a minister about the industry. Elsewhere, Labour leader Ed Miliband criticised what he called Britain's "Wonga economy", saying that the rise of payday lenders symbolised the squeeze on living standards facing millions of families. He accused the firms of preying on the vulnerable, creating a "quiet crisis" for thousands of households left with debts they were unable to pay off. The one-off committee session heard that consumer groups say complaints are up since the introduction of an industry charter to ensure loans are made correctly. Consumer Minister Jo Swinson said that lenders had "failed to get their own house in order". Greg Stevens, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, a trade body, challenged the idea that complaints were rising and said there had only been 36 complaints so far this year. Providers Wonga and Mr Lender said that 2-3% of loans were made to people who then hit financial difficulties. Henry Raine, head of regulatory and legal affairs at Wonga, said that figure, as well as affordability checks, "compared favourably" with credit card companies and banks. "We aim to lend to people who can pay us back," he said. "We do everything we can to lessen the load of bad debt." He added that Wonga's average loan was £176 for 17 days, and that customers received a variety of reminders in the final days to avoid having to extend their loans. Adam Freeman, of provider Mr Lender, said that it conducted strict affordability checks. It offered a loan to one in 100 applications, but forwarded some others on to credit brokers. Industry trade bodies said that they had not expelled any payday lenders for failing to adhere to their codes of practice. The lenders had differing views on the FCA plan to limit extension of loans to two rollovers. Lender QuickQuid told MPs that it already limited borrowers to two rollovers. However, the Consumer Credit Trade Association described the FCA plan for two rollovers as "arbitrary" and said affordability was more important. Mr Freeman agreed that there were cases in which it was better for a customer to rollover a loan and pay the extra interest. "Just because someone rolls over a loan does not mean that they are in financial difficulty," he said. Russell Hamblin-Boone, ‎chief executive of the Consumer Finance Association, said it had a code of practice that ensured lenders were only able to roll over a loan three times. He said the average time to repay was 41 days. But later in the session Richard Lloyd, of the consumer association Which?, said: "It is just not credible to say that lenders are acting responsibly to allow people to roll over their loans." MPs also heard that lenders had no system in place to check what other loans consumers had taken out with other lenders. Mr Lloyd said that rules should ensure that these cross-checks were made. He said that the fees and charges linked to rollovers was what put people in financial difficulty, and that a two rollover limit was a "good place to start". Peter Tutton, from the StepChange debt charity said that many borrowers were "in a hole and a payday loan helps them to dig the hole deeper". Gillian Guy, of Citizens Advice, said that it was not appropriate for some people to be "force fed" a payday loan, rather than given debt advice. Martin Lewis, of Moneysavingexpert.com, said it was important that the FCA prevented the rollover limit being bypassed. The danger was that borrowers would be encouraged to take another loan to pay off the original one. The hearing comes after an Office of Fair Trading (OFT) report said that there were "deep-rooted" problems in the way payday loans attracted and treated customers. It presented a dossier to the 50 leading payday lenders, which represented 90% of the UK market, about their failings and told them to improve. It also meant the industry was facing a Competition Commission inquiry. As a result, 19 firms have exited the market. Three have had their credit licences revoked. There are more than 200 payday firms operating in the UK. However, the Commons Public Accounts Committee has been scathing of the OFT's record in regulating the industry, accusing it of being "timid and ineffective" in a report published in May 2013. Providers of these short-term, high-interest loans have faced criticism from many, including Church leaders. The FCA has proposed a risk warning be added to payday lending advertisements. But loan provider Wonga has told the BBC its business practices are being misrepresented. Meanwhile, mortgage commentator Ray Boulger from the advisers John Charcol told Newsnight that taking out a payday loan could adversely affect any future mortgage offer. "Our experience is that mortgage lenders will often turn down requests for people who have had a payday loan - the regulator should require payday lenders to display this," he said. </body>

      <body>Activity in the UK services sector last month increased at its fastest rate since May 1997, a closely watched survey suggests. The Markit/CIPS PMI services index rose to 62.5 in October from 60.3 in September, beating forecasts of 59.8. Readings higher than 50 indicate growth. Markit said the services sector, which accounts for around three quarters of the economy, was the "major driving force" behind the UK's economic upturn. Employers were hiring people at the fastest rate since 1997, the survey found. The reading could lead to the Bank of England revising up its quarterly growth forecasts next week, Markit said. Alongside strong activity in manufacturing and construction, the results indicated quarterly economic growth of 1.3%, up from 0.8% between July and September this year. But total economic output for the UK is still less than its 2008 peak. </body>

      <body>Countries worst hit by the global financial crisis saw their happiness levels fall as a result, a survey has suggested. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), levels of "life satisfaction" fell sharply between 2007 and 2012 in countries like Greece and Spain. Trust in governments also deteriorated over that time. The OECD said the findings showed the far-reaching impact of the crisis. However, the UK saw its happiness levels rise 1% between 2007 and 2012, putting it in the 20% of happiest countries in the OECD, alongside the likes of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and New Zealand. The UK also bucked the trend by showing a rise in trust in the government, up from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011. "The global economic crisis has had a profound impact on people's well-being, reaching far beyond the loss of jobs and income, and affecting citizens' satisfaction with their lives and their trust in governments," the 34-member organisation said. Greece saw average life satisfaction levels fall by 20%, while Spain saw a decline of 12%, and Italy 10%. Countries less affected by the economic downturn saw less of an impact on happiness levels. In Germany, life satisfaction rose by 4% over same five-year period. But trust in governments has been eroded across the OECD as a whole, with just 40% of those surveyed saying they now trusted their governments - the lowest level since 2006. The figures were derived from a survey which gauged quality of life under 11 categories, including personal security and work-life balance. "This report is a wake-up call to us all," said OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria. "It is a reminder that the central purpose of economic policies is to improve people's lives. We need to rethink how to place people's needs at the heart of policy-making." </body>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates as soon as 2015, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) has said. The UK's central bank has stated it will not raise interest rates until unemployment falls to 7%, suggesting it could not be until 2016, said NIESR. But NIESR said unemployment rates were dropping more quickly than predicted. It said the central bank could increase interest rates in 2015 to stop the economy overheating. Unemployment in the UK currently stands at 7.7%. In a quarterly report, Jonathan Portes, director at NIESR, said some mortgage payers might find an earlier interest rate rise difficult. He said: "There may be a sense that consumer spending and possibly house prices are rising in a way that makes an ultra-loose monetary policy unnecessary." The think tank said Britain's recovery was still reliant on consumer spending, while falling incomes were causing a dent in household savings. </body>

      <title>EU sees 'hope' but also lower growth</title>
      <description>The European Commission says the EU's economy is at a "turning point", but cuts next year's eurozone growth prediction and says unemployment will stay high.</description>

      <body>The European Commission has said the European economy has reached a "turning point", but the eurozone will grow less quickly than previously expected. The Commission said there were "signs of hope" that had started to turn into "tangible positive outcomes". But in the eurozone - the 18 nations that use the euro - it predicted growth of 1.1% next year. This is the second downward revision of 2014 eurozone growth this year, after it was cut from 1.4% to 1.2% in May. The Commission forecast that the eurozone would grow 1.7% in 2015. In the EU as a whole, it expects 1.4% growth next year and 1.9% in 2015. It said overall EU growth would be flat this year, up from its May forecast, but unemployment would stay at 11.1%. Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics, said the subdued forecasts reflected the "general sluggishness" of the eurozone economy. "The norm for the eurozone is still pretty dreadful, really. Even these forecasts are still likely to be too optimistic," he said. On an individual country basis, the Commission significantly upgraded its forecasts for the UK from 0.6% to 1.3% for this year and from 1.7% to 2.2% for next year. "[The year] 2013 has thus far exceeded expectations and the outlook is quite bright," the report said on the UK. "There are increasing signs that the European economy has reached a turning point," said Olli Rehn, commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. But Mr Rehn warned unemployment would stay high. "It is too early to declare victory: unemployment remains at unacceptably high levels," he added. The Commission now expects unemployment for the eurozone next year to stay at its current level of 12.2%, up from its previous forecast of 12.1%. It also expects unemployment to improve only gradually, staying around the current level for the next two years and only dropping to 11.8% in 2015. The Commission also warned that it expected the recovery to be gradual. "While the financial market situation has improved significantly and interest rates have declined for vulnerable countries, this has not yet fed through to the real economy," Mr Rehn said. In the eurozone - the 18 member states which use the euro - the Commission predicted growth of 1.1% next year, down from its May forecast of 1.2%, and 1.7% in 2015. The Commission blamed weaker investment and the fact it expected inflation to stay below the central bank target over the next two years. The Commission also expects Greece's recession this year to be slightly less severe than its earlier forecast, predicting a fall in growth of 4% this year, compared with its earlier prediction of a 4.2% fall. </body>

      <body>Luxury German carmaker BMW has seen profit drop in its key car division, because of weak European markets and costly investment in new technologies. Pre-tax profit at the unit fell 4.1% to 1.6bn euros (£1.3bn) in the three months to September, although overall group net profit rose 3.2% to 1.3bn euros. However, the firm, which also makes the Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, said car sales in the period rose 10.7% to a new record of 481,657 units. It said Europe remained "challenging". "Reported figures for both the third quarter and the nine-month period have developed positively, despite the higher level of expenditure on new technologies and a challenging market environment in Europe," said Norbert Reithofer, chairman of the BMW management board. Mr Reithofer said BMW still expected sales volume to grow by a single-digit percentage point and pre-tax profit to be similar to last year's. "We expect further sales volume growth for the fourth quarter, even though it is clear that we - and indeed the sector as a whole - are likely to be confronted with adverse business conditions," added Mr Reithofer. The carmaker said its BMW3 Series was one of the biggest drivers of its growth, with nine-month sales of the car up by 27.6%. For the three months to the end of September, worldwide sales of Minis rose by 5.8% to 75,482 units and sales of Rolls-Royce motor cars were up by 13.6% to 825 units. Geographically, Asia was the biggest driver of growth, with sales up 24.5% in the third quarter. In the Americas region, sales rose by 15.9%, but in Europe, they increased by just 1%. Shares in BMW fell 3.2% in trading. </body>

      <body>Insurers expect to pay out £130m to policyholders whose homes, businesses and vehicles were damaged in the St Jude storm. The Association of British Insurers (ABI) said its members estimated receiving 105,000 claims following the storm on 27 and 28 October. Four people died when the storm battered southern Britain. The ABI said that advanced warning of the weather reduced the potential damage and cost. "The storm was a significant event with some tragic consequences, but advance warning meant that people were well prepared and could take steps to minimise damage and disruption," said Aidan Kerr, the ABI's head of property. "Violent weather like this is exactly what insurers expect to deal with during the year, and they will have mobilised claims teams to help customers recover as quickly as possible." The figures represent an initial estimate of the cost of the storm. The storm contributed to a drop in the share price of RSA Insurance on Tuesday. It was down more than 6% after earlier warnings that bad weather events across the world had led to losses this year. </body>

      <body>High Street retailer Marks and Spencer has reported a fall in sales of non-food items in the first half of the year. Like-for-like sales in non-food items were down 1.5% compared with the same period last year. The retailer launched its autumn/winter ranges in September. Food sales were up 2.5%, while pre-tax profits came in at £280.6m - virtually unchanged from a year ago. MandS said it remained cautious for the rest of 2013. Chief executive at MandS Marc Bolland said the company continued to invest in the "long-term transformation" of the business. He said: "We are pleased with the progress made, given the high level of activity and a number of key projects launching this year. "This has led to a higher level of additional costs, which while planned for, have impacted short-term results." The 129-year-old company said although consumer confidence was "improving", it had yet to translate to the High Street. MandS's new autumn/winter range was led by an advertising campaign featuring some of Britain's most high-profile female celebrities, including Tracey Emin and Dame Helen Mirren. Reacting to the results, deputy editor at Drapers Magazine, Anna Santi, told the BBC: "Christmas will be absolutely crucial, and if they don't have a good Christmas I think investors will be concerned." She also said MandS clothes may have become "too expensive", and that Primark does better in balancing quality and price. </body>

      <body>Shares of Japanese carmaker Nissan have fallen 10% to 861 yen in Tokyo after the firm cut its full-year profit forecast. On Friday, the firm said it expected to make a profit of 355bn yen ($3.6bn; £2.2bn) for the year to 31 March 2014, down from an earlier forecast of 420bn. Nissan said tough conditions Europe and recent recalls had hurt its earnings. It added that demand in emerging markets had been "volatile". Japan's share market was closed Monday. Analysts said that investors were worried about the short term prospects of the firm, "There are a few segmental trends which don't favour Nissan," Vivek Vaidya, a motor sector analyst at the consulting firm Frost and Sullivan told the BBC. "Large pick-up segment in US is on the rise where Nissan is not a leading player, emerging markets like India are slowing down, currency fluctuations are eating into their profit and electric vehicles segment hasn't yet taken off," he added. The cut in the forecast came despite the company posting a 6.5% jump in profit for the July-to-September quarter, from a year earlier. It reported a net profit of 189.8bn yen for the period. Nissan also announced changes to its senior management which it said were "designed to enhance Nissan's performance and ensure the company will deliver the 8% operating profit margin target set out in the Power 88 mid-term plan". Under the changes, Nissan's chief operating officer (COO), Toshiyuki Shiga, will become a vice chairman with responsibility for external affairs, asset management and corporate governance. The office and functions of the COO will be reorganised among three senior executives, the company said. </body>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all of its 450 forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, from Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <title>Check price rises, water firms urged</title>
      <description>Water firms are urged to "look closely" at what level of price rises need to be made and introduce special tariffs for hard-pressed households.</description>

      <body>Water firms have been urged to "look closely" at what level of price rises need to be made and introduce special tariffs for struggling households. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has written to companies calling on them to recognise people's financial strain. "Keeping water bills affordable is a crucial way we can help hardworking people," he said. The water industry said it was already tightly regulated and there was "no free for all" on prices. Unlike gas and electricity, households cannot switch their water supplier. Thames Water is the only one of the 18 regulated water companies to have applied to the regulator, Ofwat, to increase prices in advance of the next pricing review. Ofwat is expected to turn down Thames Water's request to increase bills by an average of £29 a year in 2014-15. The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has said average increases in water and sewerage bills had been in line with inflation since the 2009 price review but had substantially outstripped increases in household income. Mr Paterson said: "We are pressing hard to make sure customers get a fair deal by encouraging water companies to look closely at any price increases, introduce social tariffs for vulnerable customers and crack down on bad debt." A government spokesman said: "The government is working across the board to reduce the cost of living and help hardworking households who are feeling the pinch. "We want to ensure customers get a good deal from the water sector and will be setting out our approach next week." Labour's shadow environment secretary, Maria Eagle, has called on the prime minister to "require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling". She said Labour would seek to amend the forthcoming Water Bill legislation to "require all water companies to participate in a national affordability scheme and review whether there is a need for a tougher regulatory regime". She told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme water companies were "ripping people off", with bills having risen by 50% in real terms since privatisation and the industry having made £1.9bn in profits. Severn Trent Water said it would not increase bills by above inflation next year. "We know that many of our customers' incomes have been squeezed and it's right we should do what we can to keep water bills low," said chief executive Tony Wray. Conservative MP Mark Field said Labour had "struck a chord" by highlighting the squeeze on family finances and urged the government to focus on a "much more purist economic case" to avoid being seen to play catch-up. "The real danger is that we are getting away from what should be our strong point - which is the fact that growth is firmly back in the economy," he told the BBC. Fellow Conservative Robert Buckland, who is leading a backbench Commons debate on the issue of water bills later on Tuesday, said it would be "very helpful" if more firms offered special tariffs for the low-paid. However, he said the government had already taken action on council tax and fuel tax and it had the "right economic policy that will deliver the answers people are asking for on the cost of living". </body>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <title>Living Wage rises to £7.65 an hour</title>

      <body>More than 30,000 low paid workers will receive a pay rise worth up to £400 a year after a rise in the voluntary "living wage" rate. The UK Living Wage rate, which is not binding on employers, has been increased by 20p to £7.65 an hour. It is much higher than the legal UK minimum wage of £6.31 an hour. In London, the Living Wage rate has been increased by 25p to £8.80 an hour. A total of 432 employers have signed up to pay the rate, up from 78 last year. Firms signed up to the voluntary scheme include Barclays, Oxfam, Legal and General and the National Portrait Gallery. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said the living wage had become "a must-have badge of honour for employers". "By looking out for the Living Wage badge, you can now choose to support businesses that are doing right thing. It works just like Fairtrade and will grow even faster with consumer support," he added. Dominic Johnson, employee relations director at Barclays, said paying the rate had improved retention rates for its cleaners. "Early research on the impact of the Living Wage for cleaners on Barclays' contracts shows our suppliers have a 92% retention rate versus an industry average of 35%," he said. The Living Wage is set independently each year, based on the basic cost of living in the UK. The new rates were announced at the start of Living Wage Week. Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband said if his party won the next election, it would offer firms a 12-month tax break in 2016 if they agree to pay the living wage. </body>

      <title>Immigrants 'make net contribution'</title>
      <description>Immigrants to the UK since 2000 have made a "substantial" contribution to public finances, a new University College London study says.</description>

      <body>Immigrants to the UK since 2000 have made a "substantial" contribution to public finances, a report says. The study by University College London said recent immigrants were less likely to claim benefits and live in social housing than people born in Britain. The authors said rather than being a "drain", their contribution had been "remarkably strong". The government said it was right to have strict rules in place to help protect the benefits system. Immigrants who arrived after 1999 were 45% less likely to receive state benefits or tax credits than UK natives in the period 2000-2011, according to the report by Prof Christian Dustmann and Dr Tommaso Frattini from UCL's Centre for Research and Analysis of Migration. They were also 3% less likely to live in social housing. "These differences are partly explainable by immigrants' more favourable age-gender composition. However, even when compared to natives with the same age, gender composition, and education, recent immigrants are still 21% less likely than natives to receive benefits," the authors say. Those from the European Economic Area (EEA - the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) had made a particularly positive contribution in the decade up to 2011, contributing 34% more in taxes than they received in benefits. Immigrants from outside the EEA contributed 2% more in taxes than they received in the same period, the report showed. Over the same period, British people paid 11% less in tax than they received. Despite the positive figures in the decade since the millennium, the study found that between 1995 and 2011, immigrants from non-EEA countries claimed more in benefits than they paid in taxes, mainly because they tended to have more children than native Britons. The report also showed that in 2011, 32% of recent EEA immigrants and 43% of non-EEA immigrants had university degrees, compared with 21% of the British adult population. The research used data from the British Labour Force Survey and government reports. Prof Dustmann said it had shown that "in contrast with most other European countries, the UK attracts highly-educated and skilled immigrants from within the EEA as well as from outside". He added: "Our study also suggests that over the last decade or so, the UK has benefited fiscally from immigrants from EEA countries, who have put in considerably more in taxes and contributions than they received in benefits and transfers. "Given this evidence, claims about 'benefit tourism' by EEA immigrants seem to be disconnected from reality." Sir Andrew Green of the pressure group Migration Watch said the report had "been spun". "We've had roughly four million immigrants under the previous government - two-thirds of those were from outside the European Union," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the report found that, "since 1995, they have made a negative contribution overall". He added: "So the verdict for non-EU is that the benefit to the exchequer is minimal or negative." He accepted that "if you take the whole of the EU", the benefit was "clearly positive". But Sir Andrew said this would be expected "because you are including German engineers, French fashion designers and - as it's the European Economic Area - even Swiss bankers [sic]". "The real issue for the future is the very large numbers of low-paid immigrants from eastern Europe," he said. He added: "The report looks backwards but doesn't look forwards. "The professor's report does not take into account - no doubt for good reason - future health costs as migrants get older nor the pension bill, which is huge." Prof Dustmann told Today: "It is true that recent immigrants are younger but they are also much better educated. "So they will take more out of the benefit system but they will also contribute more in the future because they have not yet reached their career peak and their full income potential. "Of course, the more you earn, the more you pay in taxes." A spokesman for the government said: "We welcome those that want to come here to contribute to the economy, but it's absolutely right that we have strict rules in place to protect the integrity of the British benefits system to ensure it's not abused." He added that this was why the government was strengthening measures to ensure that benefits are only paid to people who are "legally allowed to live in Britain". Meanwhile, a separate UCL study released on Tuesday warns that the government's target to cut net migration to the UK to the tens of thousands is "neither a useful tool nor a measure of policy effectiveness". That report argues that actions to cut work-related, student and family migration have damaged the UK's reputation as a good place to work and study. The 2011 census showed that 13% of the population of England and Wales was born outside the UK. </body>

      <title>Somali remittances granted reprieve</title>
      <description>Somali money transfer service Dahabshiil has won an injunction preventing Barclays from cutting its banking services.</description>

      <body>Somali money transfer service Dahabshiil has won an injunction preventing Barclays from cutting its banking services. The injunction means customers will be able to transfer money through Dahabshiil for the foreseeable future. Barclays had planned to cut off services to the company amid concerns over money laundering. Dahabshiil is the largest provider of remittance services to the 100,000 Somalis living in the UK. They are believed to send back millions of pounds every year to friends and relatives in Somalia - a vital source of income for the impoverished country. "The Court handed down its judgment, granting an interim injunction which has the effect of preserving Dahabshiil's banking arrangements with Barclays until the conclusion of a full trial," a Dahabshiil statement read. "This is not just a victory for Dahabshiil. It is a victory for the millions of Somalis and other Africans, many of whose livelihoods depend on our services." Barclays asked to appeal against the injunction, but that request was rejected. It must now maintain services to Dahabshiil until a new hearing - expected some time next year. The charity Oxfam welcomed the injunction, but warned that it was only temporary. "The ruling provides a small window of opportunity for Somalis living in the UK to send money home to loved ones in one of the poorest countries in the world," it said. "However, this does not solve the problem - a long-term fix is needed to safeguard hundreds of thousands of people relying on the money for food, medicines and education." The charity's call for a permanent solution was echoed by Somalia's Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon, who urged: "Governments, the money remittance sector and all key stakeholders must now work together to find a permanent legitimate and transparent solution that keeps open this vital lifeline." Barclays had provided Dahabshiil with bank account services. But it expressed concern that money transfer services like Dahabshiil could be used for money laundering or even the funding of terrorism. Barclays announced plans to close the accounts of several money transfer companies, including Dahabshiil, in May, but Dahabshiil sought an injunction preventing Barclays from closing its account, on the grounds that it was abusing its dominant position. Barclays is the last major UK bank that still provides money transfer services to Somalia. Barclays argued that some money service businesses "don't have the necessary checks in place to spot criminal activity with the degree of confidence required by the regulatory environment under which Barclays operates". The withdrawal of Barclays services from Dahabshiil and similar money transfer services would have had a dramatic effect on the flow of remittances from the UK to Somalia. Remittances from the UK to Somalia total more than £100m a year, according to Oxfam, and campaigners say they provide a lifeline to Somali families with no other source of income and no access to conventional banking services. Leyla Jama, a 52-year-old Somali who came to the UK more than 20 years ago, works for the Somali Community and Cultural Association in Haringey. Like many of her fellow Somalis, she sends back hundreds of pounds a year to her elderly parents in Somaliland - a semi-autonomous region of northern Somalia. Between her and her brothers and sisters in the US and Canada, they send back more than $700 (£437) a month. "[My parents] are old so they can't get jobs," she told the BBC. "There is no other source of income. The remittances are everything to Somalia - school, food, clothes, everything." She said fears that Dahabshiil could be cut off had been a major worry among Haringey's Somali community in recent weeks. "This is a lifeline for the Somali people. Everyone sends money back, so everyone here is really worried. It is the number one thing people are talking about at the moment." International development experts say remittances are vital to countries such as Somalia, which has been ravaged by civil war and continuing political instability, where there are few conventional banking services. A recent report by the UN suggests that more than 40% of Somalia's population receives remittances from overseas - more than four million people. Oxfam suggests remittances on average account for 60% of recipients' income, with about £1bn a year coming in from Somalis in countries around the world. Only Somalis in the US send back more each year than the UK's Somali community. The importance of remittances to Somali has been underlined by the intervention of Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, who said last month that his government was watching events in London "with great concern". Somalia-born Briton Mo Farah also joined the campaign to keep remittance services going. But Barclays is facing its own pressures. Rival bank HSBC was hit with a huge $1.9bn fine for failing to prevent money laundering that had taken place through accounts it managed. The UK Serious Organised Crime Agency has identified money service businesses generally as a potential money laundering risk, prompting banks such as Barclays to move out of this area of business. Meanwhile, the presence in Somalia of militant groups such as al-Shabab, responsible for the attack on a Kenyan shopping centre last month, has raised concerns that money transfer services could also be used to fund terrorism. Somali pirates also remain a problem. But experts warn that ending transfer services, including Dahabshiil, could force the money transfer business underground, helping supporters of terrorism while increasing the risk for Somalis who simply want to support their families. "It will be the perfect opportunity for those who want to send money to Somalia to fund terrorism or enable money laundering," said Laura Hammond, a development expert at London's School of Oriental and African Studies. "It creates a black hole for accountability." </body>

      <body>Eurozone factory orders rose for a fourth consecutive month in October, leaving factories unable to keep up with demand, according to a survey. Manufacturers in the 17-country eurozone saw their backlogs rise higher as stocks of finished goods continued to fall. The Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.3 in October, up from 51.1 in September. Any reading of above 50 suggests expansion. Markit said that only France and Greece, out of the 17 countries that use the euro, failed to enjoy improved conditions. The organisation's chief economist, Chris Williamson, however, said that the pace of growth was "modest overall". "While the recovery goes on, it is by all accounts frustratingly slow. In particular, the modest gains in output and new orders remain insufficient to encourage firms to take on more staff," he added. Demand for manufactured goods increased last month, but at a slower pace than in September, while factories made little change to prices, the survey showed. "Output charges rose for the second successive month, but the rate of inflation remained marginal as competition remained strong and market demand lacklustre," Markit said. </body>

      <title>Si Shen: Rebuilding Papaya Mobile</title>
      <description>Games entrepreneur Si Shen of Papaya Mobile explains why all start-ups need to have more than one platform for their products</description>

      <body>Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families? One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of Papaya Mobile, which produces games for mobile phones. Si Shen was born and grew up in China. Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot. Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise. When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist. But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas. Her mother's example influenced her heavily. Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. "He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.' And because of this dream, he changed the world." She remembers thinking: "That's so cool! I want to do something like that!" Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California. By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company. At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur. He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first. Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal. At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time. She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying "I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company." She got the job. After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008. They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market. After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise. At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular. Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone. The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point. "All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users." Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store. As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on. The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion. "Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.' That was a very serious situation," she remembers. "I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees. Everybody was looking at me every day. They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer." She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area. Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games. "Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone," she recalls. She was devastated. Her investors pulled out and she knew she had to do something fast. She quickly decided to take the risk of moving Papaya's games to a different mobile phone system, Google's Android platform. She took the chance because although Android was just getting established at the time, she knew "it was going to be big". Her bet paid off. Papaya's games proved popular on phones running the Android system. Later, after making some technical changes, the company's games were allowed back on sale through Apple's App Store. Ms Shen says she learnt a lot from the episode, gaining a better understanding of how the business world works and the dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket. "As a start-up, you cannot just rely on one platform, because one day if that platform tells you 'no', then you lose everything. You have to have back-up." She has also learned a lot about herself. Until then her whole business experience had been very smooth, and she had not known "the taste of failure". "That taught me that no matter what happens, if you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome." </body>

      <title>Australia's small farmers struggling with low prices</title>
      <description>Despite a bumper crop of spring produce, Australia's farmers are struggling against low prices, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>

      <body>A near-perfect growing season for small farmers in two of Australia's biggest food belt regions - south-east Queensland and Victoria - has produced a bumper crop. But despite a bountiful yield, there is a nasty sting for numerous family-run farms as oversupply has driven down prices. It should be a time for celebration for growers, who have become hardened to a relentless cycle of droughts and floods in recent years. Instead many are complaining that they are being paid less at wholesale markets than the cost of harvesting their crops. At Peak Crossing, south-west of Brisbane, Wayne Allum saw part of his 10-acre (four-hectare) property disappear under murky brown floodwaters last year, but has now enjoyed textbook weather conditions following a mild Antipodean winter. Yet still he frets about his financial future. "It's a hard game sending your stuff to the markets and then not knowing what you're going to get for it. It is stressful and disheartening," says the former truck driver, who grows tomatoes, lettuces, cabbages, courgettes, and spring onions. "Prices were terrible compared to what it costs you to grow them, get them picked, grade them, box them and send them to the markets," he adds. "I won't send my stuff to the markets any more." Instead, he sells his produce from the back of a truck parked under the shade of a jacaranda tree on the main road to take advantage of passing trade. "It's not a huge living," says Mr Allum. "I'm better off just growing what I can, do everything myself and just sell it at the farm for a profit and make a living that way." The number of farmers in Australia is shrinking, and it's not just the current domestic oversupply that is hurting the bottom line. The amount of imported fresh produce has reached record levels, and Mark Vogler, owner of the Aratula Markets in Queensland, says growers are facing unfair competition from overseas imports, which he says are of lesser standard. Mr Vogler sells fruit and vegetables from local farms and wants prices to be set by the federal government to guarantee those on the land a decent return. If not, he believes the sector will continue to contract. "To see how fast the farms are going backwards has been alarming," he adds. "The Australian public doesn't know about it yet. The problem is once we do lose the ability to feed our people locally, we'll have to rely on produce that has come in from overseas unregulated." Ausveg, the industry body representing 9,000 of Australia's vegetable and potato growers, which generates about 4bn Australian dollars ($3.8bn; £2.4bn) per year, believes that financial security for its members lies far beyond the horizon. Australian carrots are an unlikely hit in Singapore and the Middle East, along with asparagus, humble fresh potatoes and leafy greens. Last year, just 7% of Australia's fresh fruit and vegetables were exported, but Hugh Gurney from Ausveg wants that to change. "There is a lot of product entering the market, and it makes it tough for growers to get a decent price for their product," he says. "As a result the Australian vegetable industry is looking more and more to overseas markets to supply fresh produce to Asia and hopefully relieve some of the oversupply in the domestic market." Yet Australia is so big that conditions for growers vary immensely, as do the triumphs and challenges, including October's bushfires in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, where some of the worst bushfires seen in New South Wales tore across vast swathes of forest and farmland. Perched off the southern coast is the "apple isle" of Tasmania, so nicknamed because it has long produced large crops of the fruit. The island of course grows many other crops, and artisan farming has blossomed on the island state in recent years, where small enterprises beaver away making high-value, niche specialities, including hand-ground spelt rye flour along with boutique jams and relishes. Crucially, the industry has established direct links to the public, according to Jan Davis, chief executive of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. "The thing that our small farmers do very, very well here in Tasmania is build on that relationship directly with consumers. So we've got a very strong farmers' market and farm gate sector down here," she says. Tasmanian farmers are also leading the way on exporting extensively. "We have product going right across the globe into Asia, Europe and the Americas. Just about anywhere you can think of there is Tasmanian product on a table somewhere," Jan Davis adds. But Tasmania's optimism gives way to a sense of gloom in other parts of Australia. In Queensland's sugar capital, Bundaberg, Mark Presser, a fourth generation cane farmer, enjoyed a record crop last year, and is on course to harvest another reasonable yield this time around. Yet he too feels besieged by falling prices and growing competition from overseas, most notably Brazil and India, where production costs are far less. He also complains about protectionism in Europe and the US. "Some days you wonder why you are doing it. We've got that much money tied up (in the business) we just can't walk away," says the 47-year old farmer, who owns 270 acres (110 hectares) of land. "The majority of the people who live in the big cities have got no idea at all how hard it is," he adds. He warns about the fate of other family-owned operators. "There aren't too many little ones left," he says. "They are just standing on the edge of the precipice and are on borrowed time." </body>

      <title>The self-critical boss</title>
      <description>A profile of Jeff Immelt, the boss of US giant General Electric, who says it is essential that chief executives are tough on themselves.</description>

      <body>Jeff Immelt, the boss of US giant General Electric (GE), has a simple explanation for how he has lasted so long in the top job - he is very tough on himself. "I think you can't do a job like this for a long time unless you're horribly self-critical," he says. "You have to be massively self-aware, because if you're not, it is so easy to be blind [to problems]." Mr Immelt, 57, has been chief executive and chairman of GE for 12 years, and it is a big and historic ship to steer. A huge, multi-national conglomerate, whose business interests include everything from manufacturing jet engines, to providing firms with finance, developing software, and making consumer goods such as dishwashers and coffee-makers, it has been in existence for 121 years. An American institution if there ever was one, GE was formed in 1892. Four years later it was one of the original 12 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average, the main US share index. Today GE is still on the Dow Jones. With offices and other operations in more than 160 countries around the world, GE has more than 300,000 employees, and last year it made a net profit of $13.6bn (£8.5bn) from revenues of $147bn. You might imagine that running such a successful and long-established business is a case of sticking to a safe, time-honoured course. But that couldn't be further from Mr Immelt's approach. Instead, over the past decade and a bit, Mr Immelt has worked hard to make GE leaner and more quick-footed, something he says is essential as the company continues to increase its presence in developing economies. "We were working on too many things that just weren't important, and so I launched an initiative inside the company called "simplification", which is really about lean structure, less bureaucracy, a complete passion for the market," he says. However, one man's leaner company is another person's redundancy, and Mr Immelt has cut thousands of jobs in recent years, particularly in GE's home market. This led to accusations of hypocrisy, because from February 2011 to January 2013, Mr Immelt was asked by President Barack Obama to look at how more jobs could be created in the US, in the role of chairman of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Yet Mr Immelt says GE needs to have "a lean, simple structure", especially in terms of removing excessive management in the US and other established markets, to better focus instead on emerging nations. "The sad thing is we have great people everywhere, but it is a zero sum game," he says. "So when you have structure in the developed world that's trying to make decisions in the developing world, it just doesn't work." Regarding the issue of securing more deals in the developing world, Mr Immelt says it is something that concerns him on a daily basis, because that is where the economic growth is. "I sit in my office every day, and say, I've got to have higher market share in China than I have in the US," he says. "I've got to win Brazil, I've got to win Africa. They're not choices, I've got to, I've got to win those countries." Mr Immelt adds that when he took over the top job at GE its operations were "70% inside the United States". He says they will never be that level again "unless we are failing horribly". More than half of GE's revenues now come from overseas. With specific regard to China, Mr Immelt says it has taken "years and decades" for GE to secure the trust of the Chinese, and that as chief executive he has led from the front. "Let's say I have gone to China two or three times a year for 25 years, so I have 75 trips' worth of contacts, and I have been in hundreds of meetings," he says. Mr Immelt adds that while some meetings may be frustrating and not seem to be worthwhile, "each one adds to the one before", and you slowly build up working relationships. "We've earned the right, I think, to be a good Chinese company, only because we put in decades' worth of work." Looking ahead, Mr Immelt, who first joined GE back in 1982, and went on to head its healthcare division, says he has no plans to give up the top jobs. "In many ways I'm the same as I was 12 years ago, but in many ways just my experience and my contacts, and my ability to look around corners, and things like that, is just so vast," he says. "You can stay too long in a job, that's for sure. But by the same token, in the 12 years I have been CEO of GE there have been four CEOs of Toshiba. So there's too short a time to do it, and there's too long a time to do it." To help keep his focus firmly on the job, Mr Immelt says he leads "a relatively simple life". "I'm like one-wife, one-company," he says. "You know I don't drink much anymore. You've got to clean up a lot of elements of your life, I think, to be able to maintain the focus and the attention." And that brings us back to the self-criticism. "I worry about the 300,000 employees, and am I being a good leader? Am I being good enough?" This feature is based on an original television interview by Steve Tappin for the BBC's CEO Guru series. </body>

      <body>Scottish football will be broadcast live in China for the first time after a contract was agreed with an online streaming provider. The deal, struck by the Scottish Professional Football League, covers the screening of 58 SPFL matches through PPLive TV. It is part of a wider £20m 10-year rights deal with sports media rights firm MP and Silva. First Minister Alex Salmond said it heralded "a bright future". The SPFL is made up of clubs in the Scottish Premiership, Championship, League One and League Two. Salmond, in Beijing for the announcement, was joined by SPFL chief executive Neil Doncaster and clubs' representative Peter Lawwell, the Celtic chief executive. The agreement will result in SPFL fixtures being broadcast alongside Premier League games from England and Spanish top-flight matches to up to 60 million PPLive TV users in China. "There is clearly a growing appetite for European football coverage in China and now football fans across this country will be able to enjoy the action from iconic Scottish footballing venues such as Easter Road, Fir Park and Pittodrie," said Salmond. "There have been some tough times in Scottish football over recent years, but with news today that clubs can look forward to a £20m boost as part of this fantastic international broadcasting deal, I am confident the fans can look forward to a bright future." Doncaster described the deal as "a brilliant result for Scottish football". "We want to build on this opportunity, not only in China but across other significant global markets and discussions with several potential partners are ongoing," he added. Speaking on behalf of SPFL clubs, Lawwell said the deal demonstrated their ambition, adding: "The English Premier League experience shows that giving overseas audiences the chance to watch games week-in, week-out is the key to building an international fan base." The SPFL has yet to find a main commercial backer after Clydesdale Bank's sponsorship of the top flight ended in the summer. </body>

      <body>Winter sports federations have been urged to fight any plans to move the 2022 football World Cup to the winter. Football governing body Fifa has set up a taskforce to consider alternative dates after concerns over high summer temperatures in host country Qatar. But the International Ski Federation (FIS) fears its sport could suffer. "FIS will submit a proposal to the six winter sports federations to sign a resolution against organising the World Cup during the winter," it said. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is also monitoring Fifa's plans, as any switch of the 2022 World Cup could impact on that year's Winter Olympics. The 2022 Winter Games take place in January and February and the IOC has previously stated it expects Fifa to consult with it to avoid any clash. The IOC held a meeting over the weekend, chaired by new president Thomas Bach and attended by Fifa president Sepp Blatter. Afterwards, it released a statement which read: "With respect to the sports calendar, the participants agreed that any new initiative has to respect the uniqueness of the Olympic Games. "It means that neither the Olympic programme nor Games revenues should be adversely affected in any way. "In order to ensure the respect of these principles, the participants agreed to the creation of a consultative working group under the leadership of the IOC, composed of the main stakeholders of the Olympic and sporting movement, which will compile a comprehensive sporting calendar of current events. "This working group will also discuss the priority of current and future sports events within the global calendar." </body>

      <title>Ways to plan a hi-tech wedding</title>
      <description>How to plan a hi-tech wedding</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24759238</url>
      <date>1383696766</date>

      <body>Anyone taking a casual stroll around the average wedding fair could be forgiven for thinking that here is a ceremony whose technology has not been updated since the days of Jane Austen. When you consider that the industry is worth more than £10bn a year in the UK alone, you would think the tech giants would be eager to give it a makeover. Instead it is smaller-scale pioneers who are making the in-roads into a sector where tradition still reigns supreme. The BBC asked bride-to-be Ella Williamson to discover how hi-tech a wedding can become. Over the past year, fashion and technology have fused like never before. We've seen the model Dita von Teese step out in the world's first 3D-printed dress and singer Nicole Sherzinger perform in an outfit showing tweets via LED lights threaded into its fabric. So, is it possible to purchase a bridal gown that displays well wishes from loved ones? CuteCircuit, the company behind the Twitter Dress, confirms it would take on such a commission. But its chief creative director suggests a more subtle concoction. "We have made wedding outfits using conductive silver fabric that create a connection when the marrying couple kiss, triggering a private message on the linings of their garments," says Francesca Rosella. The time-honoured ritual of wearing a hat to a wedding has undergone a technological revamp too. Belgian 3D-printing firm i.materialise dabbled with headwear when it launched a millinery competition for designers last year. It now offers two services for creating bespoke headgear - collaborate with one of the company's recommended designers or alternatively design your own and then have it made in the lab. The company's community officer, Tatiana de Wee, adds that 3D-printed "wedding rings, engagement rings and wedding cake toppers" are available too. Merging the virtual world and the real world is an innovative way of getting guests to save the date. So, printing firms have started to offer augmented-reality-enhanced products, allowing invitations to come to life. The process is straightforward - record a one-minute video and send the MP4 file to the company to incorporate it. By holding a smartphone or tablet over the card, the guests can then view a personal message from the bride and groom. Advocates for the tech have claimed it has been about to take off for years - but one of the businesses involved insists the wedding industry is ripe for an AR revolution. "After a slow start 18 months ago, augmented reality printing is now proving popular thanks to increased smartphone ownership, 4G networks and advertising campaigns," Chris Hughes, managing director at Stuprint.com, tells the BBC. No tech wedding is complete without at least one robot. At least Japanese couple Tomohiro Shibata and Satoko Inoue thought so. Their ceremony in 2010 was conducted by i-Fairy, a £46,000 robot by Kokoro. But in 2014, getting married by an automaton should become more affordable thanks to the launch of Oscar the WeddingBot. Oscar is a 2ft (61cm) robot intended to be an officiant, pageboy, usher or speech giver. It uses an Arduino computer as its brain, features a text-to-speech module to talk and a high-definition video camera to see, while the hands were salvaged from a broken Kinderbot toy. "After I completed my first home-made robot in 2012, my friends Mark and Sarah joked about having him at their wedding," says Minneapolis-based inventor Jon Shmig. "I told them I'd make a custom robot and as the list of features expanded I realised that other people may be interested in his services." A prototype was used as a ring bearer at a ceremony in August, and Mr Shmig says he hopes to make the final version available for hire in the US early next year. He adds it will be able to move in time to music - so, be careful that he doesn't cut in to your first dance. With 50,000 downloads in eight weeks alone, Brazil's Boyfriend Tracker app has shown many people want to know their partner's movements. The software secretly sends GPS location and SMS updates about a handset's whereabouts. This begs the question - when will a GPS chip-enabled wedding ring come to market? US engineer Benjamin Kokes has created an engagement ring for his fiancee that features embedded LEDs that illuminate when in close proximity to a specially designed transmitter. But he has doubts about adding a Find My Spouse feature. "I would not rely specifically on GPS - with current technology you couldn't pack enough battery into the ring to have any useful operation," he says. Instead he suggests including a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, which could be detected by strategically placed reader units. For less suspicious but more forgetful nearly-weds, Alaska Jewelry is developing the Remember Ring. The piece of jewellery, which is still at the concept stage, promises to self-heat 24 hours before your anniversary as a reminder. A built-in micro-thermopile would convert the heat from the wearer's hand into electricity to keep its tiny battery charged and its clock running. "We've received quite a bit of interest," says Alaska's Cleve Oines. "But we probably would not launch a GPS ring as GPS trackers and wedding rings are on opposite sides of the sentiment spectrum." If gadget shopping has left you little time to plan the rest of the celebrations, the web can again come to the rescue. American wedding planner TheKnot.com held what's thought to be the first crowdsourced wedding in New York on Valentine's Day this year. Members of the public voted online to select each element of the day - from the outfits to the Modern Ice Castle wedding theme. And if that doesn't sound ideal, you can always Photoshop the pictures. </body>

      <title>Online retailers move into High Streets</title>
      <description>The online retailers coming to a High Street near you</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24728406</url>

      <body>With the inexorable rise of online shopping, there have been gloomy predictions about the future of the bricks and mortar, High Street store. Yet it seems that reports of its imminent demise may have been exaggerated. In a new twist, established e-commerce businesses are increasingly opening physical stores. This emerging trend, labelled "clicks to bricks" or "e-tail to retail", looks set to inject some much-needed vigour back into local High Streets. A recent survey in the United States of the shopping habits of 18- to 25-year-olds suggests that just over two thirds of them - some 68% - prefer to shop in stores for clothing and shoes. "Retail observers have been significantly overestimating our use of online and digital technology for shopping - we like shopping in stores," says Nicole Flasch-Mihalko of LIM College, which carried out the survey with the National Retail Federation in the US. Online brands are now acting on this. In the UK, menswear brand Orlebar Brown, whose swimming shorts Daniel Craig famously sported in the James Bond movie Skyfall, has recently opened three London stores. A physical store offers shoppers the chance to touch, feel and try on merchandise, and for luxury brands in particular, this is important. For instance, Rapha, which started as an online business in 2004 selling high-performance cyclewear, opened its first store or Cycle Club in San Francisco in 2011. Now it also has branches in London, Osaka, New York and Sydney. Rapha says its stores have been a big hit with customers, offering a showcase for its clothing but also acting as a place to absorb cycle culture - to drink coffee, join in organised cycle rides and watch major races on big screens. "The Cycle Clubs are conceived as meeting places for road racing fans and great places for like-minded people to hang out," says Rapha's chief executive Simon Mottram. "Rapha is the host of these places and it's great for us to engineer connections between customers, not just between the customer and brand." And he says its stores are also helping Rapha to better understand its customers. "It's hard for brands to engage with their customers in a purely digital way. "That may be fine if your business is only about conducting simple transactions, but if you want to truly connect with a customer and create a deep, ongoing relationship with them, then a physical experience is invaluable. "Many people like to shop in bricks and mortar locations. There is the possibility of theatre and human interaction there - these things shouldn't be underestimated." There is a new model of retailing emerging, "with brands having a core website that covers the majority of purchases", he says. "With a number of high-touch, physical 'brand experiences' on top of that platform - allowing the customer to really engage with the brand." For Bec Clarke, founder and chief executive of jewellers Astley Clarke, it is all about "allowing customers to shop how they want". Her firm has seen rapid online growth, and has now opened a showroom and store at its London headquarters - as well as supplying a number of UK department stores. Within the next few months it also plans to supply several major stores in the United States. "There's a long consideration process to buying jewellery," Clarke explains, as we sit on plush sofas in her firm's showroom, the decor complete with mirrored furniture and luxuriant cream padded walls. "It's a whole journey of trying on and thinking about it and trying on again, and we have to allow the customer to go on that journey," she says. "It's also important for our bespoke service - clients like to see and touch the gemstones. "The heart of our business is online, but we have a 'channel agnostic' approach, which is where the world is moving to." For High Street landlords with vacant space to rent as well as online start-ups this trend is good news, says Ross Bailey, founder and chief executive of Appear Here. His firm brings together shop landlords and mainly e-commerce entrepreneurs, with the aim of making renting a pop-up or permanent physical shop easier and more flexible. "Pop-ups helps fill in any awkward pauses that a landlord may have, and it's good for brand building, too," he says. "It can be hard and expensive to get noticed online now. "But if you spring up offline - even for a short time - shoppers will love the interaction and share their experience of going there by tweeting or sharing an image online. "You can create a storm." Some e-commerce brands are moving into so-called guide shops - allowing shoppers to try on items, and then order in-store for home delivery. Bonobos menswear is at the forefront of this phenomenon, and has opened guide shops across the United States. Increasingly it seems, the channels are blurring. Bonobos founder and chief executive Andy Dunn argues that this is the future of retailing, but that "it is also the past". "When you look at retailers who are thriving in this environment, it's the brands focused on delivering a strong service experience. "It is one of the ironies of our time that a digital medium, the internet, is making the in-person shopping experience a more humane one," he says. </body>

      <title>Phosphorus: Farming's dirty secret</title>
      <description>Agriculture's insatiable demand for phosphates</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24823266</url>

      <body>Is it the biggest looming crisis that you have never heard of? Since 1945, the world's population has tripled to seven billion, and feeding that population has relied increasingly on artificial fertilisers. One of the most important fertilisers - phosphates - comes from an ore that is in limited supply. It is mined, processed and spread on to our fields, whence it is ultimately washed away into the ocean. So what will happen if one day we run out of the stuff? "Crop yields will drop very, very spectacularly," chemist Andrea Sella, of University College, London, told Wednesday's Business Daily programme on the World Service. "We will be in very, very deep trouble. We have to remember that the world's population is growing steadily, and so demand for phosphorus is growing every year." As Andrea explains, phosphorus is essential for life. The element - which is so reactive that it spontaneously combusts in its pure form - is used by plant and animal cells to store energy. It also forms the backbone of DNA, and it is an essential ingredient of our bones and teeth. Farming without it is not a realistic option. While this may sound rather alarming, there are two important caveats. First, the supply of phosphates is forecast to last for many decades, if not centuries, to come. So humanity is at no immediate risk of running out of the means to feed itself, even at the current rate at which it is gobbling up phosphates. Second, one of the biggest problems with phosphates over the past 60 years is arguably that they have been far too cheap and abundant. There has been no incentive to use them sparingly. Only a small fraction is actually absorbed by plants, much is washed off by rain. And this glut of fertilisers being washed into river systems, both phosphates and also nitrates, has created a nasty environmental problem - eutrophication. This is where the abundant nutrients feed algae in rivers and ponds, creating blooms that turn the water green. The algae then dies providing a feast for microbes, which in turn multiply and suck the oxygen out of the water, killing off all the fish and other animal and plant life. It is a common problem in the lower reaches of major rivers such as the Thames and Rhine in Europe, and Yangtze in China. Similar algal blooms occur in our oceans, where large areas - notably the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico - have become "dead zones". Purely from an environmental perspective, the price of phosphates has clearly been too low. Yet this now appears to be changing. The price of phosphate ores has risen fivefold over the past decade as demand, particularly from the developing world, has grown steadily. Meanwhile, the cost of fertiliser production has also risen as the richest, cheapest phosphate seams have already been mined. "Commodities are priced on the cost of extracting the next tonne that you need," says Jeremy Grantham, of US fund managers Grantham Mayo van Otterloo. "It is a hopelessly bad system. "As long as we can mine a vital resource cheaply, we will price it cheaply, and run through the reserves until they become very expensive. And then we'll start to conserve." There are various options: And then there is the sewage option. Why not just capture the phosphorus from our own waste and recycle it? Sweden and Germany have been leading the way. There is also a cottage industry among the eco-friendly in Western countries of "compost toilets". Now the UK's Thames Water is getting in on the act, launching a new "reactor" that turns sewage sludge into nice clean fertiliser pellets. How much of future supply could ultimately be provided by recycling is open to debate - Thames Water says 20% using the current technology. But perhaps the more important point lies in the fact that, as a private-sector company, Thames Water is not acting from the goodness of its heart. It and Canadian partners Ostara, who developed the technology, expect to make a profit from selling the pellets, as well as from saving the cost of cleaning and replacing pipes that have become blocked by a phosphorus-based sediment called struvite. Any benefits, as far as the environment or the long-term sustainable usage of a limited resource are concerned, are but a happy by-product. The important point is that it is the rising price of phosphates that has made it worthwhile to start recycling the stuff. So should we welcome the higher price? Well, it depends who you are. In general, the lower your income, the more of it you spend on food and therefore the more sensitive you are to the higher food bills that might come with more expensive fertilisers. In other words, rising phosphate prices hurt the poor most, which is hardly a recipe for social cohesion. And that goes for whole countries too. As Jeremy Grantham points out, many North African countries depend on food imports, and rising food prices contributed to the discontent behind the 2011 Arab Spring. Ironically, one of those countries is Morocco. Ironically, because by a freak of geography Morocco controls about three-quarters of the world's remaining good quality phosphate reserves. "Morocco has the most impressive quasi-monopoly in the history of man," says Mr Grantham. "It makes oil look unimportant in comparison." That could make Morocco a very rich nation in future, one that the rest of the world will be keen to court. And it gives the country a great responsibility in pricing its product in a way that eventually weans the world off it in a manageable way - much like Saudi Arabia and oil. Ironically, the higher prices that monopolists like to set may actually be what the planet needs. But Morocco's unique position could also make it a centre of intrigue. For example, much of its phosphates are actually located in the territory of Western Sahara. It is occupied by the Moroccan military, which currently has an uneasy ceasefire in place with the local Algerian-backed Saharawi resistance. This poses moral questions for the multinational companies that mine the stuff there, as well as some obvious strategic issues for the rest of the world about securing future food supplies. Mr Grantham points out that half of nearby Mali - admittedly the sparsely populated Saharan half - was recently briefly overrun by militants affiliated with al-Qaeda, and he warns that Morocco itself may one day become the scene of rising social tensions, terrorism, or revolt. "I would almost guarantee to you that the major militaries of this world are well aware of this problem. "They would not allow Morocco to become a hopelessly failed state," he says reassuringly. "You don't want to look forward to the great fertiliser wars of 2042." You can listen to Business Daily on BBC World Service at 08:32 GMT and 15:06 GMT. </body>

      <title>German home school families refugees in US</title>
      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. The modern movement started in the 1970s when Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools, says Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <description>Beck, Arcade Fire and the music videos inviting fans in</description>

      <body>Picture the scene: you're at home watching the latest concert by your favourite musician. The crowd is raving, the singer approaches them holding the microphone out and a few people climb past security onto the stage. But alas, stuck in front of your computer screen, you can't join them. Except now you can - if you're a fan of American musician Beck, that is. He is one of a few artists making interactive music videos requiring fan participation. Throughout his 20-year career the industry has seen many changes, including more people now watching music videos on YouTube than on MTV. Beck has made many memorable music videos, though he started out with limited means. "[For] my first video we had no money," he says. "I had a friend who had film in the freezer left over from film school and we used that one roll of film. "Every frame was precious." The video in question was for his hit song Loser, which went on to sell half a million copies and became one of the defining singles of the 1990s. "I was surprised when some of these videos actually got played," he continues about his early releases. "Most of them were just friends who were making them and editing them." Since then the 43-year-old has collaborated with acclaimed directors such as Spike Jonze and Michael Gondry on his music videos. Earlier this year he took this one step further, developing a 360 degree experience with director Chris Milk. In Hello Again viewers can join Beck onstage or stroll around among the 170 musicians as they play David Bowie's Sound and Vision. Viewers move around by turning on their computer's webcam and moving their heads in the direction they want to move in. For Beck, music videos can create a strong connection between bands and fans in the digital age. "I grew up in an era where the packaging was such a big part of how you related to the music," he says. The cover of Psychocandy, the first Jesus and Mary Chain album, which has a bold design and stark red, white and black colour scheme, had an especially strong influence on how he related to the band and came to understand them. "It gave me enough information, it opened up a whole idea about where this music is coming from and what it was." He believes music videos can fulfil this role in today's digital era where there is less emphasis on physical records. "I felt that they were album artwork come to life," he says about these videos. The Google Creative Lab's Aaron Koblin has directed several interactive music videos. The 31-year-old heads the data arts team and grew up in the era of big budget videos which played a large role in teen culture, but says the fan was passive. "When I used to watch music videos it was very much 'I am receiving the content which is helping me understand and create a picture of the musician's identity'," he says. "But it didn't necessarily make me feel all that much closer." He thinks interactive web-based videos enable a new way of creating that bond. He has worked with Arcade Fire on videos that require fans to interact with the band. "I hope we can create a deeper emotional experience which will then help bring a better connection," he says. Together with director Vincent Morisset, he aimed to do just that with the Just A Reflektor project, which uses the title track from Arcade Fire's latest album. Fans connect their smartphone to their webcam via a unique code on the video's site. By moving their smartphone around viewers can change the visual effects on the video, creating sprinkles of light and colour. They also can guide the protagonist on her journey and eventually join her. "Your phone and computer are actually talking to each other," Mr Koblin says. "The computer is observing and talking about the phone's location and movement and in doing that is able to construct and change the story based around the way the phone is being moved around." While videos are increasingly being viewed on the internet, interactive web-based ones are still rare. Just A Reflektor uses new code and tools, that were specifically created for the Google Chrome browser. "These things aren't that easy to make yet," Mr Koblin explains. Creating these new tools is currently the most expensive part of making these videos. "That's part of why when we create them we're releasing a lot of the code that we used and a lot of the tools that we created so we can encourage other people to get involved." Arcade Fire have tried the interactive experience before in another experiment for Google Chrome. The song We Used To Wait was used by Mr Koblin and Mr Milk to become the interactive experience The Wilderness Downtown, which uses Google Earth to bring a new dimension to the song. Viewers type in their home address and will see images of where they grew up within the video. Jordan Gauthier is an Arcade Fire fan and says their interactive videos have strengthened his relationship with the band. He grew up in the French suburban town of Rennes and says The Wilderness Downtown made him relate to the song in a new way by helping him recall his childhood memories. "It's like putting your own memories into the video," he says. "I thought that was amazing." Ultimately Beck thinks the web opens up numerous possibilities to interact with fans. "I think that's an infinite idea," he says. "That kind of idea is going to spread because the technology exists." He points to the success of crowdfunding in other fields and thinks more videos will source their ideas and materials from fans in the future. Mr Koblin and Mr Milk crowdsourced for The Johnny Cash Project, which features the song Ain't No Grave. Released after Cash's death, the interactive site pays tribute to him through a video made up of stills drawn by fans. Viewers can then select and watch the frames in different orders. As material is continuously being added to the project, every viewing is unique. Crowdsourcing can also build closer bonds between fans themselves, according to British director Ninian Doff. He crowdsourced images of fans dancing to make the video for Graham Coxon's What It'll Take. One hundred fans sent in videos from 28 countries, and Mr Doff cut up all the videos for the final piece. "It's a big jumble," he explains. "Sometimes it's one person's legs and another person's top half, or it's one person's legs, one person's body, one person's head. "It's like making a Frankenstein out of fans' bodies." And people managed to find themselves and each other through leaving comments about the video online. "One person commented saying, 'Oh that's me at 2 minutes 5 seconds'," Mr Doff says. "Then another person replied, 'I'm your legs at 2 minutes 5 seconds'. "They'd managed to meet over the internet through being connected in the video." </body>

      <title>Travel trends: thanks to PANKs and peer-to-peer</title>
      <description>How the tourism industry is responding to hard times</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-24814168</url>

      <body>As the nights lengthen and the weather turns wintry, what better time to think about getting away from it all? In a vast exhibition centre in London this week, the World Travel Market isn't intended as a consumer event. For the trade, it gives an opportunity to look ahead to the tourism industry's next destinations. As ever, it's a business with a lot of change going on. And you can tell something's up when Ryanair is showing a bit of humility and shifting its business model to one which actually wants to be liked by its customers. With a profits warning on Monday at the Irish carrier, Michael O'Leary is on a charm offensive. I've met him, and believe me: he knows how to turn on the Irish charm. He's introducing allocated seats from February, replacing the boarding scrum and ensuring families can sit together. Penalties are being cut back for changing booking details or reissue of boarding passes. You can now get an early morning red-eye flight without infuriating interruption by a loud tannoy announcement trying to flog you scratch cards. And following pressure from his client airports who want to boost retail takings, the Ryanair boss is allowing for an extra small carry-on bag - the kind that could carry, let's say, a bottle of whisky or cosmetics. Ryanair's problem is partly that its European economy is performing so poorly. It's also seeing others getting smarter about offering a better customer experience at low-ish cost, with options that appeal more than Ryanair to the more lucrative but price-conscious business traveller. IAG, which owns British Airways and Iberia, has learned the lessons of the failed GO!, and now has Vueling in the low-fare airspace. Lufthansa is doing something similar with Germanwings, and Air France with HOP. Norwegian airline is moving into low-fare long-haul with a no-frills trans-Atlantic service. From next summer, Gatwick to New York could be yours for less than £150. The trends in low-fare travel are among the top trends identified each year for the World Travel Market by Euromonitor International, the marketing data company. In the Middle East, low-fare flying is being re-thought to offer at least a glimpse or two of low-cost luxury experiences. Indeed, the travel trends reports that flying in general is heading towards less of a cattle herding experience to something perhaps a bit more enjoyable and distinctive. The trend they've spotted for the UK in particular comes from a website called routehappy.com. It doesn't only sell on destination, price and convenience but on happiness factors. Similar to TripAdvisor, it harnesses data on how content travellers are with their flights. Launched last April, it may already have had an impact on Ryanair's changed attitude to customer service. The European trend of choice for Euromonitor is peer-to-peer travel. In tough economic times for much of the continent, this can be about house swaps, car sharing and short-term car hires, or having short-term sofa-surfing lodgers. On a website such as Vayable, you can meet a local who knows a city's best street food, another guides you through local graffiti art or a homeless man gives you his tour and view of his home city. Forbes magazine reckons this sector is growing by quarter this year, and it's forecast that the European peer-to-peer market could be worth nearly £10bn by 2017. The message to hotels: watch out. And while you're at it - get more flexible about what and when you rent out. Business travellers sometimes want to have day room hires for mobile offices. Smart chains are getting occupancy rates up by catering for them. In Africa, the success of the films Madagascar and Lion King are driving a move towards more family-friendly safaris. And there's a big growth in Chinese visitors to the continent. In China itself, the government has endorsed growth of the cruise industry throughout south-east Asia, much of it around the new $1bn terminal built in Hong Kong. Cruising is a new option for most Chinese people, and there could be opportunities for the Mediterranean, Caribbean and northern Europe cruise sector to look there too. The mobile phone is, of course, one of the growth trends within mobile. That's not only to book where and when you choose. It's also the mobile as concierge, with apps the on-demand, real-time source of information to get you round your holiday destination. It would help, of course, if roaming data charges were to fall. And then there are PANKs - "professional aunts, no kids". PANKs are women who have a close relationship with children of friends or relatives. The USA is, of course, first to embrace the PANK penny. In 2010, 43% of women between the ages of 15-44 were childless, and as more women choose not to have children, it's only going to grow further. A US-based website community for aunts and godmothers, Savvy Auntie, copyrighted the demographic term last December, estimating that there are 23m PANKs in the US, roughly one in five in the age group, spending US$9 billion (£5.6bn) annually on children. To quote the website: "Move over soccer moms. There's a new group of smart, powerful women spenders out there. PANKs have time, income and a passion for purchasing the best for the kids in their lives," says Leslie Gaines-Ross, chief reputation strategist for Weber Shandwick. Nearly half of them told Savvy Auntie they enjoy travelling with nieces and nephews. Further American research shows they like to go to Disney theme parks and Hawaii, and when they leave the US, the UK is towards the top of their to-do lists. As women tend to make most travel decisions, the cruise industry targets them with its marketing, but it's careful to assume they're not thinking as mothers, or as wives. Euromonitor doesn't explain why this doesn't apply to uncles the same way, with the marketing potential of Professional Uncles with No Kids. Perhaps the PUNK acronym isn't quite what the marketers had in mind. </body>

      <body>SeaTac, Washington, is an unremarkable town that's become remarkable. Made up of fast-food restaurants and hotels that cater to the town's eponymous airport, it's mostly a stopover for people in transit, a throughway on the 25-minute drive to Seattle. But even those passing through cannot miss the alternating blue and green signs that now dot almost every lawn, billboard, and shop window of this suburb. The signs urge residents to vote yes - or vote no - for Proposition 1, a measure that, if passed, would raise the minimum wage here to $15 (£9.40) an hour. That would mark a 63% increase over the current minimum wage of $9.19 (£5.76) in Washington state, already the highest state minimum wage in the nation, and would be double the federal minimum wage of $7.25 (£4.54). Saba Belachew, an immigrant from Ethiopia, says she is desperately in need of a raise. She works two jobs at the airport and still cannot make ends meet. That's why she has added a third job to the mix - canvassing the apartment complexes here in the shadows of signs advertising car rental companies such as Thrifty and Hertz, the companies where many of these residents work. "Some doors I'll knock like three times per day - am, pm, and in the midday," she says as she clutches a handful of fliers in the car park. On this grey day, 24 hours before the town's voters must submit their ballots, she is mostly unsuccessful - but still hopes that the measure will pass. "Finally, when you find somebody when the answer is yes it makes my day," she says. Supporters of Proposition 1 say $15 an hour is a "living wage". Detractors say that it would see businesses close and lay off some of the 6,300 workers who would be impacted by the raise. SeaTac covers just 10 sq miles (26 sq km) and has a population of just 30,000, with only 12,000 registered voters. But what everyone agrees on is that tiny SeaTac has suddenly become a battleground for one of the biggest issues confronting the US economy - income inequality, or the widening gap between the rich and poor, which has risen to its highest level since 1917. "Coming out of the recession, we've seen job growth come out of the low-wage service sector," says Prof Ken Jacobs, head of the University of California-Berkeley Labor Center. That's exacerbated income inequality, he explains, because "minimum wages have been stagnant and their real value has been declining for some time". So as those at the top earn even more, those at the bottom are earning even less. A full-time worker on the federal minimum wage in 2013 earns $14,500 a year. If that worker were supporting a family with two children, that wage would put the family significantly below the poverty limit of $23,550 a year. Some 10.5 million Americans fit this definition of the working poor. President Barack Obama has called this "wrong". In his State of the Union address in January, he proposed raising the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour. "Let's declare that in the wealthiest nation on Earth, no-one who works full-time should have to live in poverty," he said. However, President Obama has been taken up with other matters, so for now it has fallen to surprising SeaTac to vote on what Prof Jacobs has called "a bellwether fight" for low-wage work in the US. Prof Robert Plotnick, of the University of Washington, says the decision to force a vote in SeaTac is a good strategy for campaigners, who first began work on their living wage initiative last spring by spurring 24-hour walkouts by low-wage workers in cities such as New York and Seattle. The airport "insulates workers from some of the possible negative impacts of a higher wage", he says. "People aren't going to stop flying out of SeaTac because it costs a little more to buy a hamburger or a beer." But business owners in the airport say there might not be any place for flyers to actually buy that burger if Proposition 1 were to pass. "To go from $9.19 an hour to $15 overnight would kill us - it would literally force us to shut our doors," says Brett Habenicht, who co-owns a Quiznos sandwich franchise located in Terminal B. Mr Habenicht says that while he "100% agrees" people should earn a living wage, he doesn't think that Proposition 1 is the right approach. "We don't expect anyone at $9.19 an hour making sandwiches to spend 20 years working for us," he says. But while that might not be the expectation, it is becoming the reality. "People who should be coming into the quick service industry as their first job are staying in the industry for a lot longer," says Anthony Anton, head of the Washington Restaurant Association, which opposes Proposition 1. He says teenagers used to make up 30% of restaurant workers in the state; now, they make up just 5%. And increasingly those remaining have families to support, like Mahananda Ghimirey, a refugee from Bhutan who lives with his wife, six-month-old son, brother, sister, mother and father in a tiny apartment. A chef at one of SeaTac's restaurants, he puts the matter very simply. "It is very hard to work 40 hours a week and... the money is not enough to pay the rent," he says.   </body>

      <description>Big business joins battle for UK role in Europe</description>

      <body>It used to be said, perhaps first by Calvin Coolidge, that: "What's good for business is good for America." In the UK the main business lobbying organisation the CBI has joined the debate about Britain's future in Europe. Its argument can be summed up as: "What's good for business is good for Britain." A lengthy study, according to the CBI's director general John Cridland, came "to the unequivocal conclusion that British business, large and small, wants to remain within a reformed EU". The CBI has produced an array of statistics concluding that membership of the EU is worth an extra 4-5% of GDP which translates into £78bn a year for the economy. That is presented as the equivalent of £1,225 per individual or £3,000 per household. The CBI wants to define the choice for the British people as "in with reform" or "out with no influence". It is a position supported by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and by David Cameron who told the CBI's annual conference that he could secure a "yes" vote in a promised referendum. The kind of reforms the CBI would be looking for would include less red tape, removing barriers to e-commerce, and ring-fencing national employment law from EU directives. Despite the CBI's enthusiasm for staying in the EU it does register unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. The CBI's intervention in this debate follows a drum-beat of statements from the business community; the first salvos in a three-year campaign to get the British people to vote "yes" to Europe. So we have had Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of financial services industry body TheCityUK saying: "I do not believe the City's pre-eminent position will survive if we lose our role as Europe's financial capital." We have had a report entitled Manufacturing: Our future in Europe which concluded that 85% of UK manufacturing firms support EU membership. Other indicators have been more cautious. There was a YouGov survey, published by the campaign group Business for Britain, which reported that - by a majority of 46% to 37% - company bosses believed that the costs of complying with the single market outweighed the benefits of staying in the EU. In October, the think tank Open Europe estimated that the top 100 EU laws cost the UK economy £27.4bn a year. So the battleground is being marked out. It is much less about a fundamental re-negotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. It is more about reforming the EU. It is the road that the rest of Europe is trying to channel the British debate down. Numerous EU leaders have made it clear that Britain will not be able to cherry pick what it likes or dislikes. There will be no tolerance of further British exceptionalism. Senior German officials have been loud and clear; they are open to reforms if they are for all 28 EU members. So David Cameron's emphasis, in recent times, has been on making the EU work better. He tried to make the recent summit about cutting red tape. He came armed with a little booklet explaining how "sweeping away barriers to growth" would "benefit all of Europe". The Commission has eagerly supported some of this agenda. They have said that 74% of Europeans believe the EU generates too much red tape. President Barroso has said the EU should be "big on big things and smaller on small things". In Brussels it is said that there was "blood on the wall" when some regulations were withdrawn by the Commission. There is a message here. The Commission is saying there is flexibility over reviewing legislation on a case-by-case basis to gauge its impact on competitiveness but the door is closed to a fundamental re-negotiation about the competences of the EU. Speaking at the CBI conference, David Cameron said: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It is a long-term strategic choice for Britain: let us reform this organisation. Let us make changes to how it works, and then let's put those changes to the British people in a referendum." He was clear that EU membership is "overwhelmingly in Britain's economic interests". So as the argument about Britain's future in Europe develops it appears less about the repatriation of powers or challenging the commitment to "ever closer union" but more about making the EU work more efficiently, with the prime minister being urged to go out and build an alliance for reform. The question is whether this kind of "reformed" EU will be enough to convince the British public, whose support for EU membership was described again by the prime minister as "wafer thin". </body>

      <title>The Wall Street boss glad she was sacked</title>
      <description>The Wall Street high flyer who was pleased she lost her top jobs</description>

      <body>Sallie Krawcheck used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street - before two very public sackings at the height of the financial collapse. Now the head of women's networking organisation 85 Broads, she says she's grateful she was fired. From 2007-2011, Ms Krawcheck held prominent roles at banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Those positions made her, arguably, the highest ranking woman on Wall Street. But, at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, she had very public clashes with Vikram Pandit, the then chief executive of Citigroup, over her insistence that the bank should repay investors who had lost money using defective financial instruments that Citi had created. Eventually, she was forced out - a fate that would once again befall her, just a few years later, after taking on the role of chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America. Although those firings certainly stung, they gave Ms Krawcheck an epiphany - she felt that in times of distress, companies react by closing ranks, and diversity, particularly gender diversity, suffers. "What I saw a thousand times during the downturn was, 'We'd like to give her that opportunity, but we need to go with the sure thing - we can't afford diversity right now,'" she says. So now, as the boss of 85 Broads, Ms Krawcheck says her goal is to work in a more active way to correct the gender imbalance at the top. Ms Krawcheck bought 85 Broads for an undisclosed fee from its founder, Janet Hanson, in May. Created by a group of women who worked at Goldman Sachs' former headquarters at 85 Broad Street, it was initially created to mentor women in the bank. Now, it's exploded to a membership organisation with more than 30,000 paid subscribers from 130 countries. Ms Krawcheck is candid in acknowledging that her purchase surprised many people. "For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way," she wrote in a post announcing her purchase. "My standard response: 'Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I'm just focused on getting the job done.'" However, she says her first job - as a research analyst at Solomon Brothers in the 1980s - taught her to invest in what is supported by research. And she says research shows that "women are a phenomenal investment and that is true in almost any way you can define it". Ms Krawcheck cites data showing that companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity. However, despite those statistics, she thinks that gender diversity - particularly in the financial services industry - has stalled, mostly as a result of the fallout from the financial crisis. "During periods of stress, it's easier for all of us to be with people like ourselves," she says about Wall Street's behaviour during that time. "But eventually it becomes a shortcut." She thinks that as a result of this impulse to push out outsiders, bad decisions can often get made. "What I saw was a good deal of groupthink [during the financial collapse]," she says. "The same people, same types of backgrounds, looking at the same data coming to the same conclusion - which in this case was wrong." During that time, she adds, she was "talked at" a couple of times - but not necessarily listened to. She says that her goal at 85 Broads is to listen to the membership to figure out ways to convince Wall Street bosses and other large organisations that gender diversity is crucial to their success - that in times of stress, instead of closing ranks, companies should look for an outsider perspective. Furthermore, she wants to expand the mission of 85 Broads to invest in companies helmed by some of its members or by other powerful women. Ms Krawcheck is candid that while her two firings helped her crystallise what she wanted to do as an executive, it certainly wasn't easy to fall so swiftly, twice. "In my mind, I sat on my sofa in my sweatpants for nine months and waited for the phone to ring," says Ms Krawcheck, about the time after she was sacked by Citigroup. But she says she is grateful for both the highs - and the lows. "I've had a lot of ups and some downs and people have asked about how I've weathered them," she says. "I know for a lot of entrepreneurs there's a sense of optimism [in being boss of your own company]. I'd say the more overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude." </body>

      <title>Workers await news on shipyard jobs</title>
      <description>Hundreds of workers on the Clyde and south coast wait to hear about their jobs after the BBC learned defence company BAE Systems is to announce cuts at three UK shipyards.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24831779</url>

      <body>Workers at BAE Systems shipyards on the Clyde and the south coast of England are awaiting news of major job losses. The BBC has learned the company may cut more than 1,000 jobs at Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow and at Portsmouth. An announcement is due on Thursday on the cuts. It is understood Govan will not close. The job losses are expected to result from a reduction in work for the Royal Navy following the completion of two giant aircraft carriers. Union leaders have said they will hold talks with BAE Systems early next week. Some of the jobs being lost may be offset by a contract to build the new Type 26 Global Combat Ship. But BAE Systems has yet to announce which of its UK shipyards will be chosen to carry out the work. A well-placed source has told the BBC the government was "acutely conscious of the politics of the Clyde" ahead of next year's referendum on Scottish independence. But the Scottish secretary of the GMB union, Harry Donaldson, said any decision should be based on economic rather than political grounds. He told BBC Breakfast: "To be perfectly frank I think it is disgraceful that politicians are getting into looking at these yards as a political football. "It needs to be about communities, it needs to be about people and it needs to be about what is best for Scotland and the rest of the UK as a maritime nation. "I just hope that the politicians can get their act together, think of the future, think of safeguarding jobs and investing in getting these Type 26 orders forward for order fulfilment so we can make a smooth transition. "We may well lose some jobs in the interim, but keeping these yards open, that is the major issue, so people can get the opportunity to come back into employment". He called on the government to bring forward the Type 26 orders in order to create a transitional phase, because: "If you lose the jobs then you lose the skills and the problem is you will lose the ability to then compete in a very competitive marketplace" BBC political editor Nick Robinson said the announcement by BAE Systems would be followed by a Commons statement from the defence secretary later on Thursday. The job losses would result from the completion of work on the building of the two aircraft carriers and from a huge increase in the costs of that project, he added. It emerged on Monday that the UK government was planning to announce that it will need to spend an extra £800m on the carriers, taking the total costs to more than £6bn - double the original estimate. Beyond the carriers there are currently no new orders on the books of BAE's Glasgow yards at Govan and Scotstoun. Any job losses, however, may not take effect immediately because some work on the aircraft carriers is planned until 2015. The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions said it would hold talks with senior BAE Systems executives early next week to "examine the business case" of the forthcoming announcement on jobs. General secretary Hugh Scullion said: "Now is not the time for idle speculation or indeed party political point scoring; this is the future of an industry and we need to know from the company and the government directly what their plans for the future of UK shipbuilding are." There are currently 3,200 people employed by BAE across Govan and Scotstoun, and 1,200 employed in shipbuilding at Portsmouth. BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago. A BAE spokeswoman said: "We continue to work closely with the Ministry of Defence to explore all possible options to determine how best to sustain the capability to deliver complex warships in the UK in the future. "This work is ongoing and we are committed to keeping our employees and trade unions informed as it progresses." Shadow defence minister Vernon Coaker called on the government to give "urgent clarification" on the future of the UK's shipyards and dismissed accusations that Labour was responsible for the overspend incurred in building the two aircraft carriers. The Scottish government has said it has been in dialogue for some time with BAE Systems over the future of the Clyde shipyards. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was a "very worrying time" and the workforce at both the Govan and the Scotstoun yards deserved to know what the future held. "Scotland is a maritime nation. If you look at countries similar to Scotland, like Norway, they have got much bigger shipbuilding industries than we do so there's no reason why both of these yards shouldn't have a secure, long-term future," she said. </body>

      <title>UK visa help for foreign executives</title>
      <description>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get extra help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme.</description>

      <body>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme. About 100 "high value" executives will be invited to join the new Great Club, to ensure their immigration checks are completed "swiftly and smoothly". They will be offered personal support in navigating the immigration system, including their own "account manager". But they will still have to undergo the same checks as ordinary travellers. The 12-month pilot follows criticism that curbs on immigration are deterring wealth creators from coming to the UK. The government has made it harder for migrants from outside the EU to come to the UK unless they have specific skills as well as attempting to crack down on students and family members overstaying their visas. Home Secretary Theresa May said it would enable the UK to maintain a "competitive visa system that can innovate in order to serve the ever-changing needs of business and ensure Britain succeeds in the global race". "We will continue to listen and respond to the needs of high-value and high-priority businesses so that we can provide them with a service that supports economic growth while at the same time maintains the security of our borders." Last month, Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would be simplifying its visa procedures to make it easier for Chinese visitors to enter the country. A same-day business-oriented visa service, currently in force in India, will be introduced in China and other countries. The number of countries benefiting from a priority visa service - which enables eligible applicants to have their applications fast-tracked on paying a fee - will rise from 67 to 90 by next April. Business Secretary Vince Cable and Mayor of London Boris Johnson are among those to have warned against deterring the "brightest and the best" from coming to the UK, amid claims that tougher requirements for foreign students to stay in the UK after graduation are putting many off from coming in the first place. And plans to impose visa restrictions on Brazilians were put on hold earlier this year amid concerns that it would damage commercial links with Brazil's fast-growing economy. </body>

      <body>A Conservative MP has referred himself to Parliament's standards watchdog, while rejecting claims that he offered to set up business deals in return for hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Daily Telegraph reported that Mark Pritchard said he would be able to broker investments overseas using his political contacts in Albania. It said he asked for £3,000 a month for consultancy and 3% of any deal. Mr Pritchard said the allegations were false and he wanted to clear his name. Mr Pritchard, MP for the Wrekin in Shropshire, sits on the all-party group for Albania but there is no suggestion he was willing to support deals in Parliament. In fact he told an undercover reporter that he did not lobby. No money changed hands. Had Mr Pritchard agreed and properly declared a contract of this sort it is not clear whether he would have broken any rules, BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins says. Mr Pritchard said the Telegraph's allegations were false and denied the newspaper's claims, and he was consulting his lawyers. He also said: "I have asked the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate the matter so I can clear my name." </body>

      <body>Scuffles have broken out and 11 people have been arrested after protests by the Anonymous movement at Buckingham Palace and Parliament. Hundreds of protesters started a fire near the palace and blocked Parliament Square in the Bonfire Night protests. The demonstrators, many wearing Guy Fawkes masks, were confronted by police, some of them in riot gear. Anonymous was due to hold protests around the world, with similar events in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Linked protests took place in more than a dozen Brazilian cities including in the country's business capital Rio de Janeiro where traffic was brought to a standstill. Activists also took to the streets in cities including Washington, Philadelphia, Berlin, Madrid, Dublin, Warsaw and Beirut. Comedian Russell Brand was pictured attending the protest in London, while Green Party MP Caroline Lucas tweeted that she had taken part. The demonstrations against austerity cuts, corruption and state surveillance were promoted on Twitter with the hashtag #MillionMaskMarch. Protesters said they planned to burn energy bills as part of the events in London. The Metropolitan Police said 11 people had been arrested during the protests. </body>

      <title>Apology over 'plebgate' row evidence</title>
      <description>A police officer apologises to MPs for "inadvertently" misleading them and expresses regret for "distress" caused to Andrew Mitchell and his family during the "plebgate" affair.</description>

      <body>A police officer has apologised to MPs for an "inadvertent error" in evidence to them about the "plebgate" affair. Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire Police, said he had made an "honest" mistake in a previous hearing held by the Home Affairs Committee last month. He also said he regretted the "distress" felt by Andrew Mitchell and his family during the whole saga. But Sgt Chris Jones, of West Midlands Police, said he had not misled MPs over his disciplinary record. On Tuesday, he told MPs 13 complaints had been made about him but none had been upheld. The two men met MP Andrew Mitchell in his Sutton Coldfield constituency in October last year, a month after the then chief whip had been accused of calling Downing Street officers "plebs" when they refused to let him ride his bicycle through the main gates. He apologised for using bad language but denied using the word "pleb". He later resigned as chief whip as the row continued. After the meeting the officers, who as part of the Police Federation represent rank and file officers in Warwickshire and the West Midlands, told the media Mr Mitchell had failed to give an account of what had happened in Downing Street. But a transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made of the meeting suggested he had provided an explanation - a view endorsed by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. The two men, who were questioned for a first time by MPs last month, were asked back to correct their earlier evidence. This happened after the committee found Det Sgt Hinton had been "mendacious" over comments recorded in the transcript of the meeting with Mr Mitchell, in which he referred to this "woman that the Conservative Party have". Det Sgt Hinton refused to acknowledge he had meant Home Secretary Theresa May, but he later said he had. Both men said it had not been their intention to mislead the committee and apologised if they had done so. Det Sgt Hinton said he had had listened again to the recording of the meeting with Mr Mitchell and acknowledged that he had referred disparagingly to the home secretary as "this woman". This was clearly inappropriate, he said, and confirmed he had written to Mrs May to apologise. Asked why he had not admitted this in his previous evidence, the officer said he had not remembered the remarks at the time and did not believe they "made sense". "It follows that I inadvertently gave an inaccurate answer to the committee," he said. "There was no intention to mislead the committee. I repeat my unqualified apology to the committee for this inaccuracy." Sgt Jones has been accused of not providing a "full account" of his disciplinary record after telling MPs at the previous hearing that he had never had any official warnings about his conduct. It emerged after the hearing that more than 10 complaints had been made about his behaviour. He said he apologised if he had misunderstood the question but said none of the complaints had resulted in disciplinary proceedings although two - including one that followed an off-duty incident during which he had pushed a fellow officer in the back causing him to sustain a mouth injury - resulted in "management advice" being given. The two men said they were "not indifferent" to the pain that the whole episode had caused Mr Mitchell, saying "each of us fully recognises and regrets the fact that such distress has been caused". But Sgt Jones said he stood by the men's version of what was said during the October 2012 encounter. "I cannot apologise for something I have not done," Sgt Jones - who has been accused by some Conservative MPs of not giving a full account of the details of the meeting - insisted. Labour MP Keith Vaz, who chairs the committee, said he accepted the officers' comments but was "disappointed" that they had not given an "unequivocal apology" to Mr Mitchell and his family. He said he understood Andrew Mitchell's wife was in the audience and it had been a "really important opportunity for them to say to her and her family that distress was caused". It was, he added, now up to the Independent Police Complaints Commission to decide if disciplinary proceedings were warranted against the officers concerned after a previous inquiry by the three forces resulted in no action. The chair of the police watchdog Dame Ann Owers said she hoped to conclude its inquiry by the end of the year. The BBC News Channel's chief political correspondent Norman Smith said the hearing had not drawn a line under the affair and that the stakes for the officers were very high. </body>

      <title>Army reserve plan 'could be revised'</title>
      <description>The Army's programme to recruit more than 10,000 additional reservists by 2018 may have to be revised if it fails to deliver the numbers required, the defence secretary says.</description>

      <body>The Army's programme to recruit more than 10,000 additional reservists by 2018 may have to be revised if it fails to deliver the numbers required, the defence secretary has said. Philip Hammond told the Commons Defence Committee the target was "challenging" but he was confident it would be met. The Army Reserve is being expanded to 30,000 to offset cuts of 20,000 troops in the regular Army. A leaked Ministry of Defence memo last month warned recruitment was lagging. The Daily Telegraph reported that fewer than half the required numbers of reservists had so far been recruited in what was described as a "hostile recruiting environment". Under government plans the regular Army is being cut from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, while the Army Reserve - formerly known as the Territorial Army - is being expanded from 19,000 to 30,000. Mr Hammond said there was "a huge focus on the issue". "We will be publishing quarterly data but I can assure you we are scrutinising weekly reports of recruiting numbers," he told MPs. Asked what would happen if there was a failure to produce the necessary recruits, Mr Hammond said: "If there is a persistent and significant discrepancy, clearly the plan will have to be revised. The plan will not be delivering." Mr Hammond said changes to the programme could be introduced, including improved incentives for reservists and their employers. "I am very confident that we will be able to deliver this agenda," he said. "It will be challenging but nobody ever suggested that the things we are trying to do would not be challenging. We know what we have to do. We will deliver." The Chief of the General Staff, Gen Sir Peter Wall, said that the IT system on which the programme was based had not "got off to the best start" but said the problems were being remedied. He said they were only "three months into a five-year campaign" and so the pessimism from the committee's questioners was "a little bit difficult to relate to". </body>

      <title>Miliband pledging 'recovery for all'</title>
      <description>Ed Miliband pledges to restore the "broken link" between economic growth and living standards and renew his attack on the leading energy firms.</description>

      <body>Ed Miliband has pledged to tackle the "Wonga economy" of payday lenders and move to restore the "broken link" between living standards and growth. Labour's leader renewed his attack on energy firms, and urged water firms to offer special tariffs for the low-paid. The election would offer people a choice whether to "tackle the cost of living crisis or shrug our shoulders". At the same time, ministers have written to water firms urging them to keep bills at "affordable" levels. Labour has made the cost of living its central economic argument since Mr Miliband announced plans for a 20-month energy price freeze from May 2015 should Labour win the next election. Four of the so-called "big six" energy firms have announced price rises of between 8% and 10%, taking the cost of an annual dual fuel energy bill above £1,400 in many cases. In a speech in London, Mr Miliband said he would force a parliamentary vote on the price freeze plan on Wednesday and challenge Conservative and Lib Dem MPs to back it or set out an alternative. "It is workable," he said. "It will happen if Labour wins the next election. And Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs could vote for it. "If they line up against it, the British people will know the truth. This government is on the side of the big energy companies not hard-pressed families." Research by Labour, he argued, suggests that more than half of the annual increase in fuel bills since 2011 has gone directly to support the profits and costs of the leading energy firms. The "big six" say they have been forced to raise prices because of the increase in the wholesale price of energy, rising transmission and distribution costs and environmental and social obligations imposed by successive governments. They say profits account for about 5% of the average bill and insist they would reduce bills if the cost of green levies - which ministers have pledged to review - were paid out of general taxation instead of being passed onto consumers. Mr Miliband said Labour was determined to reform markets "not working in the public interest" - citing a proposed levy on payday lenders, a cap on regulated rail ticket increases, and a crackdown on private rental charges as well as tax breaks for employers to offer a "living wage". Mr Miliband criticised what he called Britain's "Wonga economy", saying that the rise of payday lenders such as Wonga symbolised the squeeze on living standards facing millions of families. He accused the firms of preying on the vulnerable, creating a "quiet crisis" for thousands of households left with debts they were unable to pay off. His comments came as executives from payday lenders faced questions from MPs, and prompted a strong response from Wonga, who accused Mr Miliband of "rehashing myths about our business". The firm said their levels of bad debt were comparable with credit cards at 7.5% and said that as a "responsible lender we reject 80% of first-loan applications, while the successful 20% borrow an average of £178". "While we recognise there have been unacceptable practices in the sector... we have used technology to bring competition into traditional financial services for the benefit of people across the country." Mr Miliband also called for extra help for people struggling to pay their water bills. New social tariffs for the low-paid, which were introduced on a voluntary basis last year, should be made compulsory, he said. The issue of household bills has become a hot political topic in recent weeks and ahead of Mr Miliband's speech the government wrote to water firms to urge them to "look closely" at the need for future price increases amid concerns about the size of bills and specific plans for a 8% rise from Thames Water, the UK's largest supplier. "We know that household budgets are under pressure, and keeping water bills affordable is a crucial way we can help hardworking people," Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said. "That is why we are pressing hard to make sure customers get a fair deal, by encouraging water companies to look closely at any price increases, introduce social tariffs for vulnerable customers and crack down on bad debt." But Mr Miliband accused ministers of a "make do and mend" attitude to the squeeze on family finances - saying prices were continuing to rise faster than wages and the benefits of the recovery were being "scooped by a few at the top". "We have a prime minister who thinks we can detach our national economic success from the success of Britain's families and businesses," he said. "We have to permanently restore the link between the growth and living standards for all Britain's working people. This government cannot do it. And the reason is because they are wedded to Britain competing in a race to the bottom." The government has said the energy price freeze is a con which will force up prices while the CBI business group has warned Mr Miliband and others against "simplistic soundbites" over prices. David Cameron and Nick Clegg say stronger-than-expected growth, falling unemployment and low interest rates show they have won the argument and Labour's policies would risk higher borrowing and financial instability. Ministers point to recent action they have taken on the cost of living, such as limiting rail ticket rises, freezing MoT costs and pledging to freeze fuel duty until 2015. </body>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <body>The British ambassador in Berlin has been called in to Germany's foreign ministry to respond to spying allegations. The UK's Independent newspaper says the British embassy in Berlin may house a "top-secret listening post". It cites leaked US National Security Agency (NSA) documents suggesting the UK could be using hi-tech equipment housed on the embassy roof. Any such activity would be against international law, Berlin says. A spokesman for David Cameron said the prime minister had not spoken to Chancellor Angela Merkel about the spying allegations and there were no plans for a conversation, although their relationship was "excellent". He refused to comment on security issues but said Britain's intelligence services operated under a "strong and clear legal framework". German Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle had requested the attendance of UK ambassador Simon McDonald to respond to the claims, a ministry spokesman said. "The head of the European department asked for a response to current reports in the British media, and pointed out that the interception of communications from the premises of a diplomatic mission would be behaviour contrary to international law," he said. The Independent report, published on Tuesday, was based on NSA documents leaked by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. The report said the NSA documents, in conjunction with aerial photographs and information about past spying activities in Germany, suggest that Britain is operating a covert listening station close to the Bundestag, Germany's parliament, and Chancellor Angela Merkel's offices. Aerial photographs of the embassy in Berlin show a white, tent-like structure, which the newspaper says has been in place since the embassy was opened in 2000. Equipment within the unit "would be capable of intercepting mobile phone calls, wi-fi data and long-distance communications across the German capital," the Independent reported. It follows revelations that the US has listened to mobile phone calls made by Mrs Merkel since 2002. The row has led to a serious diplomatic crisis between the two countries. </body>

      <title>Six-week 'pause' for lobbying plan</title>
      <description>The government agrees to calls from charities to hold a fresh consultation over changes to how much they can spend on campaigning in an election year.</description>

      <body>The government has agreed to calls from charities to hold a fresh consultation over changes to how much they can spend on campaigning in an election year. Ministers have announced a "pause" of nearly six weeks in proposals that would tighten the requirements on organisations other than political parties to register their spending. Critics say the plans are a "muddle" and will stifle democratic debate. The coalition said it would consult with "all interested parties". The government has already made a series of concessions to its proposed lobbying bill, which would also establish a statutory register of lobbyists. The bill, brought forward following allegations about the influence of lobbyists on government decision-making and the involvement of peers and MPs with lobbying groups, is intended to improve transparency and confidence. But campaigners from across the political spectrum have said the proposals relating to the voluntary sector - which would reduce the cap on what any third-party organisation could spend across the UK in the run-up to and during elections from £961,500 to £390,000 - would muzzle political debate. They say reducing the threshold at which organisations deemed to promote a party or an individual candidate must register would impose an "enormous" administrative burden. Announcing the pause - which will last until 16 December - Deputy Lords leader Lord Wallace said: "In that period I and my other colleagues in government responsible for this bill will consult widely with all the interested parties - members of this House and the many others outside." He added: "I stress that we are listening and want to listen. We have already shown willing." The move came after former chief inspector of prisons Lord Ramsbotham threatened to force a vote to send part of the bill to a special committee in the Lords - which would have effectively delayed its progress until well into 2014. A No 10 spokesman said it wanted to make sure that the legislation was got right. The National Council of Voluntary Organisations said it supported the move but urged the government to use the time to have a more fundamental rethink of its objectives. "We still need to see substantial changes in order to ensure normal charity campaigning, which has been part of public life in this country for decades, is truly protected," said its chief executive Sir Stuart Etherington. "In addition to increasing the thresholds for registration with the Electoral Commission, the government needs to deal with the proposed constituency spending limits and other measures that would create alarming levels of red tape for charities, such as asking them to account for staff time." The House of Commons approved the principle of the legislation - called the Transparency of Lobbying, non-Party Campaigning, and Trade Union Administration Bill - in September but many Tories and Labour MPs called for significant changes. </body>

      <body>Former civil servant Sir Hayden Phillips is to chair the appointment panel for the board of the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO), it has been announced. Sir Hayden was chosen for the task by the Foundation Group, headed by ex-judge Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers. IPSO has "overwhelming support" from the press and will allow it to maintain independent regulation, supporters say. Its proposed establishment follows a row between newspapers and ministers. The industry moved to set it up its own regulatory body after editors opposed a cross-party charter to create a new watchdog, which they said could "neuter" the press. On Sunday, Culture Secretary Maria Miller told the BBC she wanted to see independent regulation "within the context of a Royal Charter" but encouraged the press to put their own system in place. Lord Phillips said: "The Foundation Group identified Sir Hayden Phillips as the person whom it wished to chair the Appointment Panel. "Sir Hayden has agreed to undertake this task provided the proposals for the new body, which were circulated last week, receive overwhelming support from the press." </body>

      <body>The EU misspent 6.6bn euros (£5.5bn; $8.9bn) of its budget funds last year - an increase on the amount misspent in 2011, European auditors say. The highest rate of misspending was in rural development and the environment, at 7.9%. Errors in "cohesion" spending for struggling regions totalled 6.8%. The auditors' report stressed that "errors" was not a euphemism for fraud. Usually "errors" were allocations to ineligible projects or breaches of public procurement rules. The EU's total budget spending for 2012 was 138.6bn euros, of which about 80% was jointly managed by the European Commission and authorities in the member states. The overall error rate rose to 4.8%, from 3.9% in 2011. The auditors said more than half of the errors could have been prevented by national authorities. Commenting on the findings, the European Court of Auditors spokesman Aidas Palubinskas said "our audit of the EU budget is far more rigorous and transparent than any other audit done on any member state budget". "I can't think of any other organisation that has an audit like ours," he told BBC News. The auditors found many errors in underlying transactions, but despite that, "since 2007 we have signed off on the accounts - they represent materially and fairly the state of income and expenditure of the EU", he said. He gave as examples of accountancy breaches the lack of a public procurement procedure for a project or service, or a farmer declaring forest as pasture land, resulting in a bigger payout. Cases of fraud are the responsibility of the EU's anti-fraud agency Olaf. A conservative member of the European Parliament's budgetary control committee, Ryszard Czarnecki MEP, said "clearly control systems are still lacklustre in far too many areas". "We must end this annual debacle. It undermines confidence in the EU as a whole. The buck stops with the Commission for these shortcomings, but we all have a responsibility to improve this situation: from the Commission to national and regional governments." A centre-right German MEP, Markus Pieper, said "failure to abide by public procurement rules and disrespect for eligibility criteria have been sources of errors for years, but the near-doubling of the error rate in agricultural spending is a surprise". </body>

      <title>Payday loan rollover plan challenged</title>
      <description>Payday lenders are divided over a plan to limit the number of rollovers of short-term, high-interest loans, MPs hear.</description>

      <body>Payday lenders are divided over a plan to limit the number of rollovers of short-term, high-interest loans, MPs have heard. The City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has proposed a limit of two extensions of payday loans if borrowers chose not to repay. The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) has suggested that one rollover was a sign that a borrower was in difficulty. But lenders told MPs that rollovers were suitable in some cases. Payday lending is being put under the microscope by MPs amid a defence from some of the industry's biggest players. Members of the Business Select Committee quizzed lenders, consumer groups, regulators and a minister about the industry. Elsewhere, Labour leader Ed Miliband criticised what he called Britain's "Wonga economy", saying that the rise of payday lenders symbolised the squeeze on living standards facing millions of families. He accused the firms of preying on the vulnerable, creating a "quiet crisis" for thousands of households left with debts they were unable to pay off. The one-off committee session heard that consumer groups say complaints are up since the introduction of an industry charter to ensure loans are made correctly. Consumer Minister Jo Swinson said that lenders had "failed to get their own house in order". Greg Stevens, chief executive of the Consumer Credit Trade Association, a trade body, challenged the idea that complaints were rising and said there had only been 36 complaints so far this year. Providers Wonga and Mr Lender said that 2-3% of loans were made to people who then hit financial difficulties. Henry Raine, head of regulatory and legal affairs at Wonga, said that figure, as well as affordability checks, "compared favourably" with credit card companies and banks. "We aim to lend to people who can pay us back," he said. "We do everything we can to lessen the load of bad debt." He added that Wonga's average loan was £176 for 17 days, and that customers received a variety of reminders in the final days to avoid having to extend their loans. Adam Freeman, of provider Mr Lender, said that it conducted strict affordability checks. It offered a loan to one in 100 applications, but forwarded some others on to credit brokers. Industry trade bodies said that they had not expelled any payday lenders for failing to adhere to their codes of practice. The lenders had differing views on the FCA plan to limit extension of loans to two rollovers. Lender QuickQuid told MPs that it already limited borrowers to two rollovers. However, the Consumer Credit Trade Association described the FCA plan for two rollovers as "arbitrary" and said affordability was more important. Mr Freeman agreed that there were cases in which it was better for a customer to rollover a loan and pay the extra interest. "Just because someone rolls over a loan does not mean that they are in financial difficulty," he said. Russell Hamblin-Boone, ‎chief executive of the Consumer Finance Association, said it had a code of practice that ensured lenders were only able to roll over a loan three times. He said the average time to repay was 41 days. But later in the session Richard Lloyd, of the consumer association Which?, said: "It is just not credible to say that lenders are acting responsibly to allow people to roll over their loans." MPs also heard that lenders had no system in place to check what other loans consumers had taken out with other lenders. Mr Lloyd said that rules should ensure that these cross-checks were made. He said that the fees and charges linked to rollovers was what put people in financial difficulty, and that a two rollover limit was a "good place to start". Peter Tutton, from the StepChange debt charity said that many borrowers were "in a hole and a payday loan helps them to dig the hole deeper". Gillian Guy, of Citizens Advice, said that it was not appropriate for some people to be "force fed" a payday loan, rather than given debt advice. Martin Lewis, of Moneysavingexpert.com, said it was important that the FCA prevented the rollover limit being bypassed. The danger was that borrowers would be encouraged to take another loan to pay off the original one. The hearing comes after an Office of Fair Trading (OFT) report said that there were "deep-rooted" problems in the way payday loans attracted and treated customers. It presented a dossier to the 50 leading payday lenders, which represented 90% of the UK market, about their failings and told them to improve. It also meant the industry was facing a Competition Commission inquiry. As a result, 19 firms have exited the market. Three have had their credit licences revoked. There are more than 200 payday firms operating in the UK. However, the Commons Public Accounts Committee has been scathing of the OFT's record in regulating the industry, accusing it of being "timid and ineffective" in a report published in May 2013. Providers of these short-term, high-interest loans have faced criticism from many, including Church leaders. The FCA has proposed a risk warning be added to payday lending advertisements. But loan provider Wonga has told the BBC its business practices are being misrepresented. Meanwhile, mortgage commentator Ray Boulger from the advisers John Charcol told Newsnight that taking out a payday loan could adversely affect any future mortgage offer. "Our experience is that mortgage lenders will often turn down requests for people who have had a payday loan - the regulator should require payday lenders to display this," he said. </body>

      <body>The minister overseeing the HS2 rail project has issued an official correction after getting muddled over the size of his department's budget. Robert Goodwill suggested in the Commons last week that the transport department's overall budget was £50bn. The actual figure is less than £13bn. He told MPs the £42bn cost of HS2 equated to just 10 months of his department's overall expenditure. In fact, it would equate to its whole budget for more than three years. Mr Goodwill, who became a minister in October's reshuffle, made the mistake in response to a question from Tory MP Cheryl Gillan, a critic of the planned high-speed rail link between London, the Midlands and the north of England. She asked him how he responded to doubts expressed by the National Audit Office (NAO) about the government's ability to deliver the project on time and on budget. "He is now claiming to have one of the largest infrastructure budgets of any government department, but the NAO does not think the department is fit to run it," she said. In response, Mr Goodwill said his department had "a lot of experience in managing big projects" before suggesting its annual budget was "about £50bn". Comparing the figure with the cost of HS2, he said: "If rolling stock were excluded and nothing else was done with the department's budget, this project would be the equivalent of about 10 months of the department's total budget. "That puts it into context." But the Department for Transport has issued a correction in a written statement to Parliament, clarifying that the minister had actually been thinking of a completely different budget. It said "the figure quoted was actually a figure for the government's annual capital investment budget". A spokesman told the BBC: "As set out in the Spending Round the department's total annual budget is £12.8bn for 2015/16. The government's annual capital investment budget for infrastructure is £50.4bn for 2014/15." But Labour's transport spokeswoman Mary Creagh said it was "alarming that a transport minister is so out of touch he doesn't even know his own department's budget". "It's easy to see how David Cameron's government gets big projects wrong when ministers' maths is this dodgy." </body>

      <body>Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman has admitted not voting at a recent election, despite criticising comedian Russell Brand for doing the same. He told the Radio Times he found political parties "unappetising" and he was tired of "tawdry pretences". On Newsnight last month, he berated Mr Brand, who urges revolution and non-participation in elections, for not "being arsed" to vote. But Mr Paxman told the magazine that Mr Brand had an "irresistible" quality. The 63-year-old, who has presented Newsnight since 1989, questioned Mr Brand, the star of films including Forgetting Sarah Marshall and Arthur, on the BBC Two show about his political ideas. Mr Brand argued he had never voted because of "absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". At the time, Mr Paxman responded by asking: "If you can't be arsed to vote, why should we be arsed to listen to your political point of view?" But in his interview with the Radio Times, he said: "I think part of Russell Brand's diagnosis is right. There is a huge sense of disillusion out there. "At the next election we shall have a choice between the people who've given us five years of austerity, the people who left us this mess, and the people who signed public pledges that they wouldn't raise student fees, and then did so - the most blatant lie in recent political history. "It won't be a bombshell if very large numbers of the electorate simply don't bother to vote. People are sick of the tawdry pretences." Mr Paxman added: "Russell Brand has never voted, because he finds the process irrelevant. I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo-chamber. But it is all we have." He revealed that he had not voted in a recent election "because I thought the choice so unappetising". "By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote - cannot even be bothered to write 'none of the above' on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all." Mr Paxman said he had harboured low expectations of Mr Brand, 38, before the Newsnight encounter, as he was "a multimillionaire with a house in California talking about the need to take from the rich and give to the poor". But he added: "There is something irresistible about him... he stands squarely in the British tradition of cheeky chappies." </body>

      <title>Badger cull fails to meet target</title>
      <description>Some 940 badgers were killed in total during a pilot cull, which was lower than the planned target, the government admits.</description>

      <body>One of the badger cull pilot schemes failed to meet its target - even after a three-week extension, the government has admitted. The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were "designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers". "I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November," said Mr Paterson. "During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. "This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. "While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane." Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a "complete failure" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' "The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards," said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. "Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. "The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping." Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because "the badgers have moved the goalposts". "By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations," she said. "David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed." </body>

      <title>DSD wants £8m housing grant returned</title>

      <body>The government is to seek the return of £8m from a Northern Ireland housing association after a major project failed to deliver a single new home. Helm Housing received the public funds in 2007 to part-finance its £9.7m purchase of land in Belfast. Helm's proposal was for 200 homes on the site at Great George's Street. But nothing was built and now an Audit Office report has said the Department of Social Development (DSD) "is minded to begin recovery procedures". The undeveloped land, beside the M3 flyover, has been the subject of several investigations. Its former owner sold it for £6.5m to an Isle of Man-registered company which then sold it on to Helm Housing for £9.7m later that same day. The DSD has told the Audit Office it is "unable to obtain any explanation for these transactions". The land is now worth considerably less. Helm Housing has undergone a major shake-up in recent times after failures were identified in how the organisation was run. It has a new chief executive, chairman and board members. In 2011, it was barred from obtaining public money to build new homes. But following a recent review by the DSD, Helm has now been reinstated on the government's social housing programme. Helm, one of the biggest housing associations in Northern Ireland, said the move "heralds a new era". </body>

      <body>The cost of a bike hire scheme in Dumfries works out at more than £60 per rental, new figures show. The £155,000 Bike2Go project was the first of its kind in Scotland and it was hoped it could go into other areas. However, Dumfries and Galloway Council is not including the scheme in a planned regional rollout of initiatives to reduce car journeys. Since its launch in September 2010 the bikes have been hired 2,270 times - a daily average of about two rentals. The scheme was set up to encourage people to get "out of their cars and onto their bicycles". It provides bikes free of charge to subscribers at 11 locations across the town. It is based on similar schemes in Paris, Barcelona, Stockholm and one in London which clocked up one million journeys in its first 10 weeks. The Dumfries project has struggled to increase rental levels since it started. After 10 weeks they averaged about 20-a-week, with winter weather being blamed for the low uptake. The council promised a marketing campaign to encourage increased use of the bikes. A poor summer was again blamed for low uptake in 2012. Plans were then proposed to make the bikes available to all council staff when on business in Dumfries. However, some councillors questioned the value of the scheme which has 171 members on latest figures. One suggested it would have been cheaper to buy them all a bicycle and said the project was "in danger of becoming an embarrassment". </body>

      <title>Voters wary of 'paying more tax'</title>
      <description>The first minister indicates he does not believe people in Wales would vote in favour of devolving income tax if a referendum was held now.</description>

      <body>The first minister has indicated he does not believe people in Wales would back devolving income tax if a referendum was held now. Carwyn Jones was speaking in a debate about the Silk report at the Senedd. The report published last week said the Welsh government should get some power to vary income tax by 2020 following a referendum. Last week Mr Jones said the way the Welsh government received its funding should be reformed first. In a debate on the UK government's response to the Silk report on Tuesday, Mr Jones said: "People will begin on the basis of believing in a referendum and, let's be honest with ourselves, that any referendum on the devolution of income tax would be to them a way of paying more tax. "Whether that's true or not is a different issue but that's what their default position will be. "It might be possible at some point to make an argument that overcomes that but I don't believe that position is yet reached." Last week Mr Jones said a referendum on devolving income tax must not happen until the Treasury changed the way it funded the UK's nations and regions. He said the Barnett formula - which determines how much the Welsh government gets from the Treasury - should be reformed first. In his announcement in the Welsh assembly on Friday, Prime Minister David Cameron said he wanted to ensure a "strong Wales inside a strong UK". He said the Welsh government would also get borrowing powers. The devolved administration has been calling for borrowing powers so it can raise money to pay for work on the M4 motorway in south Wales. It will also have control over stamp duty and landfill tax. But the power to vary a portion of income tax and keep the proceeds would require a referendum. The timing of when the vote is held would be up to the Welsh government and the assembly. At the weekend Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Kirsty Williams told BBC Wales the first minister was "frightened" of taking responsibility over income tax powers. A spokesman for the first minister had said Ms Williams's claim was "preposterous". </body>

      <title>HS2 : Which cities to benefit?</title>
      <description>A new report says Nottingham and Derby will benefit the most from HS2.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24747301</url>

      <body>Like anyone with a favourite train set, David Cameron isn't about to give up on HS2. In Prime Minister's Questions, he robustly defended the need for a high-speed rail link. With Labour now questioning the overall cost, HS2 supporters may be getting rather nervous. That explains why the government has published another document - the fifth so far - on the benefits for our big cities. This time, the key message is the economic spin-offs, rather than the shorter journey times promised by the new line to London. And tucked away in the details of the Department for Transport's "Strategic Case for HS2" is the finding of a KPMG audit of the benefits for the regions. Its model is based on improved connectivity: how businesses are able to connect with suppliers and potential customers. Its findings put a figure on that, and guess what: Nottingham and Derby emerge as the "city region" that will benefit the most from high speed rail. The KPMG conclusion estimates a big improvement in business connectivity. This is the league table for the city regions along the route: The government's HS2 report also estimates what that could be worth for the Nottingham/Derby economy: an extra £2.2bn a year. But does that still make HS2 worth it? That's where the political and economic debate still remains. "We are always supportive of infrastructure projects, even HS2. But they have to provide good value for money," Ron Lynch, head of the business organisation, the Institute of the Directors in the East Midlands, said. HS2 opponent and Tory MP Andrew Bridgen believes Labour doubts over the £42bn cost now put the whole idea in doubt. The proposed route would cut through his North West Leicestershire constituency, with an HS2 rail tunnel going under East Midlands Airport. "A whole raft of independent bodies - even the Treasury Select Committee a couple of weeks ago - said there is no business case for HS2 and that it should be suspended," he told me. Labour's current position is best summed up by Shadow Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood, herself a Nottingham MP. "We are in favour, but the government can't be irresponsible about the cost. They've got to keep that cost under control and they've got to demonstrate to the public it's value for money," she said. When the East Midlands HS2 station - between Derby and Nottingham - is built at Toton Sidings, London will be 51 minutes away, it will be 19 minutes to Birmingham, and it'll be one hour 42 minutes to Newcastle. It's that prospect of such shorter journey times and the economic advantages that attract the leader of Nottingham City Council, Labour's Jon Collins. "There's an opportunity for us to get a rebalancing of the economy, so that not all the growth is happening in and around London and South East, " he said. "We'll see significant economic growth and economic benefits coming to the Midlands and the North from HS2. That's why people should strongly support it." In the national debate over the economic spin-offs for the English regions, the advantage for Nottingham and Derby has barely figured. The two cities' top position in the HS2 economic benefits league table may surprise many. But ponder this: at the last general election, the East Midlands helped deliver David Cameron into Downing Street. The East Midlands may help deliver HS2 for the prime minister, if the economic case for this region wins over the sceptics. </body>

      <title>Will UKIP factor become UKIP fact?</title>
      <description>Will West Midlands voters turn to UKIP when the looming elections come around and if so how will it affect the other parties?</description>

      <body>"Predictions in politics are inherently unreliable because they are, by definition, merely projections of the present". So said the late lamented doyen of journalists, authors and satirists, Malcolm Muggeridge. His words of wisdom offer a timely warning to any of us who may be tempted to scan the daily outpourings of opinion pollsters in the hope of divining the likely outcome of the 2015 General Election. What if, for example, the 2014/15 winter is plagued by power cuts? Or further hikes in energy prices? Aren't these exactly the sorts of shocks, (absolutely no pun intended) that could lead to the number-crunchers themselves being given a good crunching? But I mustn't fall into exactly the same trap St Mugg was warning us about: just because energy is the "hot button" issue now doesn't mean that it will be equally highly-charged in 18 months' time. If Muggeridge were around today, he would probably urge us to be just as circumspect about the so-called 'UKIP factor'. Suitably forewarned and forearmed, here goes: The conventional wisdom is that it will. A poll by the former Conservative deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft recently suggested UKIP could draw so much support from Tories in marginal seats they might otherwise win from Labour, and in others that they might otherwise hold, that a new slogan was born: "Vote UKIP, get Labour". A less fashionable view comes from the West Midlands MEP Mike Nattrass. Elected as a UKIP MEP, he resigned from the party last month and now sits as an Independent. He says UKIP's immigration policies will hit Ed Miliband's party hardest of all in their key seats. Incidentally, Mr Nattrass currently sits as an Independent MEP in the European Parliament. Which means both the successful UKIP candidates in the last European Elections in 2009 have now left the party to form new ones: Nikki Sinclaire will be standing for the We Demand a Referendum Now Party. We all know about "Super Tuesday" in the US Presidential merry-go-round. But save the date: Thursday, 22 May, 2014 will see polling not only for hundreds of seats in 19 local authorities across our region, but also for the seven seats representing nearly six million West Midlanders in the next European Parliament. Part of the calculation is that by delaying the council elections so that they fall on the same day, each set of elections will bolster turnouts in the other. UKIP's poll ratings encourage them to believe they can improve on the two European seats they secured last time. They hope this would give them a stronger springboard into 2015 than they managed last time. By the time of the 2010 general election they suffered the dreaded "squeeze" so often endured by the "smaller parties" and fell back to just 4% of the vote. Even allowing for Muggeridge's warnings, UKIP's recent poll ratings certainly encourage them to believe they are on the brink of a fundamental shift in British politics which mean they are a "smaller party" no longer. There is no question that UKIP have broadened their message beyond their original single issue campaign: I have marvelled at how effectively they rallied their popular (or should that be populist?) campaigns themes; emphasising their anti High-Speed Rail credentials in some places and their pro-local hospital commitments in others. How will all this gel together into a coherent theme for next year's European Elections? That will be one of the questions I shall be putting to Jill Seymour, the chair of Kynnerlsey Parish Council in Shropshire. But more to the point she was also recently named in first position on UKIP's candidates' list for next May. And she will be one of my guests on this week's Sunday Politics from 11.00 on BBC One in the West Midlands. And I hope you will be able to join us too. </body>

      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>School dinners have improved but there should be a drive to get more children eating them as the take-up remains stubbornly low, an association of school caterers says. Free schools and academies are currently exempt from the government's nutritional guidelines, but research found 92% of parents wanted to see the same standards applied to all schools. The chair of the Lead Association for Catering in Education said people still remember soggy cabbage and lumpy custard, but reckoned "there has been really good hard work" to improve the food, and that: "We are finally cooking on gas". Anne Bull said only 1% of packed lunches meet nutritional standards for school food, and that hot school meals were "by far the best option". Mrs Bull will be a guest on BBC2's Daily Politics where she will discuss the film at around 12:40 GMT.

      <body>Polls show Democratic candidate Bill de Blasio well ahead in Tuesday's election for the mayor of New York to succeed three-term mayor Michael Bloomberg, a Republican-turned-independent. Rob Carolina, chair of Democrats Abroad, told the BBC2's Daily Politics that "New York City has always had progressive leanings" and was now "coming back to its real political roots" as he spoke about de Blasio policies. Mr de Blasio, the city's public advocate, who ran Hillary Clinton's 2000 Senate campaign and is seen as one of the most liberal mayoral candidates in decades, is up against Republican Joe Lhota, a former senior official in the Bloomberg and Giuliani mayoral administrations.

Matthew Hancock, who was debating with Labour's Caroline Flint, said one of the eight new firms in the market may have to leave if Labour brought in its price freeze, which could see prices rise. The Conservative MP said he wanted to "bring down profits through a more competitive industry".

      <title>Time for MPs to snuff it out?</title>
      <description>Why is snuff still available to MPs free of charge?</description>

      <body>It is said to offer a performance-enhancing pick-me-up for crucial Commons tests of mettle... or chemical consolation for those found wanting. But do MPs still need their supply of snuff? Under a tradition sparked when smoking was banned in the chamber in the late 17th century, snuff, or powdered tobacco, is distributed on demand and free of charge to MPs. Few partake nowadays, and for Green MP Caroline Lucas it has become an emblem of how Parliament remains tethered to a bygone era. "As I walked into the chamber today, I noticed the snuff box still provided for MPs by the entrance," Ms Lucas reported in 2012, during a debate on reforming Commons working hours. "I hope that members will take this opportunity to bring the Commons out of the snuff age and into the 21st century," she said. The sight of the snuff box - fashioned from wood reclaimed from the old Commons chamber, which was destroyed in World War II, and decorated with a silver plaque - piqued another MP's curiosity, and he tabled a written question in Parliament on the topic. Conservative MP for Gillingham and Rainham Rehman Chishti called on the House authorities to disclose how much snuff had been distributed to his colleagues in the past decade, and at what cost. "It is unusual for members to request snuff, and there are no regular users of this facility. No records of usage or cost are maintained," came the response. "Recent practice has been for this tradition to be maintained at the principal doorkeeper's personal expense." Mr Chishti told the BBC: "Parliament is full of these quirky and anachronistic rituals and procedures. "The last time this question was asked it was found that in 1989, 1.5 oz of snuff was being consumed at the cost of 99p. "The answer to my recent question appears to show that no one's really using it, it's not paid for by the taxpayer and it's therefore not currently costing very much money." Robin Fell, the current occupant of the principal doorkeeper post, described his snuff-distribution duties as a "great privilege" in a recent interview with BBC Parliament's Sam Francis - despite the apparent paucity of dabblers. "It may come as a surprise to some people, as it does to some MPs, that I pay for the snuff," he said. "A member may perhaps feel the need for a mild stimulant before he enters the chamber, or perhaps when he's leaving the chamber if he's had an unfortunate experience in there. "But it's not a serious drain on my emoluments, because when I took over the job, my predecessor left me with a nice supply of snuff and I haven't had to replenish it yet. "In due course, I suspect, perhaps next year, I might have to tootle off to a snuff shop, and purchase some." Martin Dockrell, the director of policy and research at public health charity Ash, commented: "It seems a shame for the poor doorkeeper who has to shell out from his own pocket for MPs' snuff. "But this tradition is a useful reminder of just how far things have changed. It used to be the sign of a good host to offer visitors tobacco and now it is the sign of a good guest not to smoke indoors - at least not without asking. "It is, of course illegal to give free samples of tobacco products so organisations should be wary of following Parliament's example, unless they share the immunity of a royal palace." There appears to be scant data on the health risks for non-smokers using nasal snuff, although an increased risk of cancer has recently been observed in smokers and ex-smokers who take the powder. Public Health England notes that similar products, such as chewing tobacco, are "known to be carcinogenic", and advises "strongly against use of tobacco in any of its formulations, including snuff". But Ms Lucas concluded that the Commons snuff supply was "perhaps just a faintly amusing anachronism, which falls into the category... of traditional things that are not harmful". The principal doorkeeper puts it pithily: "If members want a pinch of snuff, why shouldn't they have a pinch of snuff?" </body>

      <body>You just can't leave matters as they are. So said Alistair Darling - perhaps Labour's most prominent and trusted Scottish MP. The former chancellor was calling for a full inquiry into allegations that people were signed up to the Labour Party without their knowledge by supporters of Unite the union as it sought to control the selection of the next MP for Falkirk. Yesterday one of the families at the heart of the allegations told the Daily Mail and separately the BBC that they had not changed their original claims about wrongdoing in Falkirk. However, Labour HQ say that there is no new evidence and that that same family - the Kanes - are sticking to their later statement signed in front of solicitors which suggested there hadn't been wrongdoing. Thus, the party says there is not new evidence to justify re-opening their original inquiry. Ed Miliband has had a good run and would, no doubt, like this story to go away so he can focus on the next election. However, Alistair Darling, who is running the Better Together (or NO) campaign ahead of the Scottish referendum, senses that it will not go away on its own. He is not calling for Labour's inquiry report into Falkirk to be published since he believes it is now out of date and, in any case, the evidence was given under guarantees of confidentiality. What he is saying is that Labour should start a new inquiry if a second police investigation now under way does not lead to prosecutions. The question is - will he persuade his party leader? </body>

      <title>Change of tone for Labour on HS2?</title>
      <description>Has there been a change in Labour's thinking about HS2?</description>

      <body>Do I detect a small change in tone from Ed Balls on high speed rail, a little softening of the usual critique? Today the shadow chancellor repeated his party's scepticism about the project in his speech to the CBI. He warned about keeping a check on rising costs and deployed the usual language about not giving the government "a blank cheque". Here is an excerpt: "The Labour Party cannot - and will not - give the government a blank cheque. That is what you would expect from any credible official opposition seeing a government desperately mismanaging a project. "And that is what is happening here with the costs having shot up to £50bn. Indeed, the costs have gone up by a staggering £10bn in the last year, so I of course welcome the prime minister's belated recognition that he needs to get a grip. "As you at the CBI have said recently: 'The increased costs of HS2 are a matter of concern. For HS2 to go ahead it has to wash its face. The value for money test has to be properly applied.' "We agree - and we will put the national interest and the taxpayer interest first. "We will take a hard-headed look at the costs and benefits of the scheme to ensure this is the best way to spend £50bn for the future of our country." But note that last sentence. Labour's priority now, he said, is to ensure that HS2 is the best way to spend £50bn. The implicit assumption in his language is that Labour wants the project to go ahead but will make sure money is not wasted. There is less explicit doubt about whether Labour would support HS2. Contrast this with what Mr Balls told Victoria Derbyshire on BBC 5Live on 25 October: "What I am saying is that we need to know the costs are under control and the benefits are real. "And if we judged that it wasn't in the national interest, we would not go ahead. And if it is in the national interest, if this is the best way to spend £16bn on transport in the next Parliament and the extra billions in the years after, then we'll give it the go-ahead. "But, at this stage, I genuinely don't think that the evidence is there, the case has been made. The National Audit Office has been very critical and the government can't answer the questions. "In those circumstances, it would be irresponsible for me to say, regardless of the benefits, we are going to pull the plug, but it is also really irresponsible for me to say 'well OK, whatever it costs and however obscure the benefits, we will go ahead anyway'." Mr Balls' explicit argument then was that if the arguments about cost and benefits did not stack up, then Labour would not support the project. Labour's support was much more in the balance. He made a similar point in his party conference speech in September, when he said: "Under this government the High Speed 2 project has been totally mismanaged and the costs have shot up to £50bn. David Cameron and George Osborne have made clear they will go full steam ahead with this project - no matter how much the costs spiral up and up. "They seem willing to put their own pride and vanity above best value for money for the taxpayer. "Labour will not take this irresponsible approach. So let me be clear, in tough times - when there is less money around and a big deficit to get down - there will be no blank cheque from me as a Labour chancellor for this project, or for any project. "Because the question is - not just whether a new High Speed line is a good idea or a bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50bn for the future of our country." That crucial first question - whether or not HS2 is a good or bad idea - appears now to have been answered by Labour; it certainly has disappeared from Mr Balls' public pronouncements. Mr Balls' aides insist that the position has not changed, that I am reading too much into this, that Labour's future support for HS2 has still yet to be determined. And I know that, to some, this might appear arcane Westminster kremlinology. But if Ed Balls is shifting his language on how £50bn of your and my tax pounds may be spent, on an issue of public policy where Labour's long-term support matters hugely, that is interesting. </body>

      <title>Europe: The fight for UK hearts and minds</title>
      <description>Big business joins battle for UK role in Europe</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24801895</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70897000/jpg/_70897590_1524742f-266d-442b-8c2b-8b523233a3f6.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>It used to be said, perhaps first by Calvin Coolidge, that: "What's good for business is good for America." In the UK the main business lobbying organisation the CBI has joined the debate about Britain's future in Europe. Its argument can be summed up as: "What's good for business is good for Britain." A lengthy study, according to the CBI's director general John Cridland, came "to the unequivocal conclusion that British business, large and small, wants to remain within a reformed EU". The CBI has produced an array of statistics concluding that membership of the EU is worth an extra 4-5% of GDP which translates into £78bn a year for the economy. That is presented as the equivalent of £1,225 per individual or £3,000 per household. The CBI wants to define the choice for the British people as "in with reform" or "out with no influence". It is a position supported by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and by David Cameron who told the CBI's annual conference that he could secure a "yes" vote in a promised referendum. The kind of reforms the CBI would be looking for would include less red tape, removing barriers to e-commerce, and ring-fencing national employment law from EU directives. Despite the CBI's enthusiasm for staying in the EU it does register unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. The CBI's intervention in this debate follows a drum-beat of statements from the business community; the first salvos in a three-year campaign to get the British people to vote "yes" to Europe. So we have had Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of financial services industry body TheCityUK saying: "I do not believe the City's pre-eminent position will survive if we lose our role as Europe's financial capital." We have had a report entitled Manufacturing: Our future in Europe which concluded that 85% of UK manufacturing firms support EU membership. Other indicators have been more cautious. There was a YouGov survey, published by the campaign group Business for Britain, which reported that - by a majority of 46% to 37% - company bosses believed that the costs of complying with the single market outweighed the benefits of staying in the EU. In October, the think tank Open Europe estimated that the top 100 EU laws cost the UK economy £27.4bn a year. So the battleground is being marked out. It is much less about a fundamental re-negotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. It is more about reforming the EU. It is the road that the rest of Europe is trying to channel the British debate down. Numerous EU leaders have made it clear that Britain will not be able to cherry pick what it likes or dislikes. There will be no tolerance of further British exceptionalism. Senior German officials have been loud and clear; they are open to reforms if they are for all 28 EU members. So David Cameron's emphasis, in recent times, has been on making the EU work better. He tried to make the recent summit about cutting red tape. He came armed with a little booklet explaining how "sweeping away barriers to growth" would "benefit all of Europe". The Commission has eagerly supported some of this agenda. They have said that 74% of Europeans believe the EU generates too much red tape. President Barroso has said the EU should be "big on big things and smaller on small things". In Brussels it is said that there was "blood on the wall" when some regulations were withdrawn by the Commission. There is a message here. The Commission is saying there is flexibility over reviewing legislation on a case-by-case basis to gauge its impact on competitiveness but the door is closed to a fundamental re-negotiation about the competences of the EU. Speaking at the CBI conference, David Cameron said: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It is a long-term strategic choice for Britain: let us reform this organisation. Let us make changes to how it works, and then let's put those changes to the British people in a referendum." He was clear that EU membership is "overwhelmingly in Britain's economic interests". So as the argument about Britain's future in Europe develops it appears less about the repatriation of powers or challenging the commitment to "ever closer union" but more about making the EU work more efficiently, with the prime minister being urged to go out and build an alliance for reform. The question is whether this kind of "reformed" EU will be enough to convince the British public, whose support for EU membership was described again by the prime minister as "wafer thin". </body>

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24765783</url>
      <date>1383311222</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70837000/jpg/_70837867_badger.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <title>Star Wars movie to hold open casting</title>
      <description>Unprecedented open casting sessions are to be held for Star Wars: Episode VII around the UK and Ireland in November, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Open auditions are being planned for two lead roles in the next Star Wars film, the BBC has learned. The casting sessions for Star Wars: Episode VII will start later this week at locations around the UK and Ireland, including London, Dublin and Glasgow. According to a casting notice the film-makers are looking to fill two roles. They are a "street smart and strong" orphaned girl in her late teens and a "smart capable" man in his late teens or early 20s. The open auditions for a "major Hollywood Movie" were first published on the twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a "nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie". Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series, in October 2012. Lucasfilm declined to comment to the BBC but it seems likely that the characters have been given non sci-fi names and descriptions in the announcement in an effort to disguise that the auditions are for Star Wars: Episode VII. The broad nature of the characters is almost the same as in descriptions leaked online earlier in the year when the overall casting process began. While it is unprecedented for lead parts in a franchise of this size to hold open auditions in this way, Star Wars has in the past given major roles to little known actors and actresses through the traditional casting process, dating back to the original trilogy when the then unknown Mark Hamill won the role of Luke Skywalker. Other movies have successfully cast secondary actors and actresses through open auditions in the past most notably some of the later Harry Potter films. And actress Dakota Blue Richards won the lead role of Lyra in The Golden Compass, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, through open casting. Director JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the movie, will not be attending the open auditions which begin in Bristol on 9 November. Instead those at the auditions, who must be over the age of 16 for the female role, and over 18 for the male role, will briefly meet members of the casting team of the film. Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios in spring 2014, for an expected 2015 release. </body>

      <body>Two 18th century George Stubbs paintings, featuring a kangaroo and a dingo, are to stay in Britain after an appeal backed by David Attenborough. A £1.5m donation from shipping magnate Eyal Ofer has enabled the National Maritime Museum to buy the paintings. Commissioned after Captain James Cook's first Endeavour voyage, they were put under an export bar in January after being sold to a buyer outside the UK. They are the first known depictions of the Australian animals in Western art. Kongouro from New Holland and Portrait of a Large Dog were first exhibited together in London in 1773 and have remained in the UK ever since. Stubbs used sketches and specimens to create the paintings in the UK. Both paintings were privately owned until they were sold in late 2012, when they were put under an export bar because of their place in British history and artistic culture. Attenborough, who backed the nationwide Save Our Stubbs appeal, said it was "Exciting news that these two pictures, so important in the history of zoological discovery, are to remain where they were commissioned and painted." A statement from the National Maritime Museum said it was "delighted" with the donation from the Eyal Ofer Family Foundation. Contributions from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Monument Trust, the Art Fund and the public also helped the museum to purchase the paintings, which it says will "greatly enhance" its permanent collection. It already holds collections relating to Cook's three great voyages and these paintings will be central to a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Cook's Endeavour voyage in 2018. The works will initially go on display in the historic Queen's House, which is part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, in summer 2014. The gallery space will be named The Eyal Ofer Gallery. The shipping magnate has supported numerous projects including the new building programme at Tate Modern and the Royal Row Barge Gloriana for Her Majesty's the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. "My family has a long connection with this great maritime institution and these paintings are a landmark in Britain's history of maritime exploration and Captain Cook's voyages," he said. The export licence deferral was placed on the pictures in January by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, who said it was "great news" that the "strange and wonderful paintings will be available to be enjoyed by everyone for generations to come." </body>

      <title>Byford: £1m BBC pay-off 'not greed'</title>
      <description>The BBC's former deputy director general defends his controversial £949,000 redundancy pay-off, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it was "not greed on my part at all".</description>

      <body>Mark Byford, the former deputy director general of the BBC, has defended a controversial pay-off package that saw him leave the BBC with £949,000. He told BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire: "I absolutely don't think it was greed on my part at all". Byford left the BBC in 2011 after being made redundant as part of a drive to cut the number of highly-paid senior executives at the BBC. He sidestepped questions about paying any of the money back. He said the pay-off was "properly approved" and added: "I absolutely think I've done no wrong." A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), released in July this year, criticised the BBC for paying out £25m in severance to 150 outgoing senior BBC managers - £2m more than their contracts stipulated. Byford's payment was revealed to be the highest at £949,000, after 32 years of service at the BBC. Byford, speaking to Derbyshire during an interview to promote his new book, admitted it was a large sum but said that he had not wanted to leave the corporation. "I lost my job, I was made redundant, I left when I was told to leave by the BBC. After 32 years of working there I was devoted to the corporation," said Byford. "It was a lot of money and it was in a context that I was the number two at the BBC and I'd served more than 30 years there. "It was in a context of being made redundant in a very big cull of senior management. I felt very strongly myself that it should touch every level including right at the very top." He continued: "I didn't want to go, I loved my job but I absolutely understood that if it [redundancy] touched me I would accept it." When Byford left the BBC in 2011 his pay-off was made up of 12 months' salary worth £474,500, with a further £474,500 pay in lieu of notice, despite the fact that he had stayed on to work on coverage of the Olympics and the royal wedding. He also received £73,000 for holiday he had not used since 2004. Former director general Mark Thompson, who oversaw Byford's payment, was questioned about the issue by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in September this year. He told them that Byford's pay-off had represented "value for money" and denied current director general Tony Hall's claims that the BBC had "lost its way". Since taking up the job in April Lord Hall has introduced a cap on BBC severance payments of £150,000. When asked by Derbyshire if he deserved his payout, Byford said it was what had been approved by the "appropriate body" at the BBC, the remuneration committee. "I wasn't there, I took no part in it and I was given what I was given," he said. He added that he had not entered into any salary negotiations "since the day I joined the BBC aged 20 on a holiday job". In September, former BBC chairman Lord Grade defended Mark Byford's pay-off during an interview on BBC Newsnight, and said he was a "great asset to the BBC". Lord Grade also suggested that Byford could have prevented recent crises at the BBC, including the failure to broadcast a Newsnight investigation into sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile. However on Tuesday, Byford told Derbyshire it was impossible to say whether he would have handled things differently. "I don't think you or I can answer that with any sense of accuracy or insight, because I wasn't there," said Byford. "As part of my responsibilities [as ....of journalism at the BBC] the most complex and sensitive editorial issues would land on my desk. Whether those things would have been handled in a different way you just can't say." Byford also denied that he had ever heard rumours about Jimmy Savile during his career at the BBC. "I started at the BBC in 1979 at BBC Leeds, his home city, my home area of West Yorkshire. As you said, I stayed in the BBC for 32 years. I never heard any of those rumours or anecdotes or claims about sexual abuse on BBC premises," said Byford. He continued: "Obviously I'm as horrified, disgusted as any other individual or employee at what happened. Obviously the first and primary concern is about the victims of that abuse. "It's absolutely horrific. The BBC has got to learn those lessons and ensure that that kind of behaviour and incident can never ever happen again." </body>

      <title>Masters' unknown works in Nazi trove</title>
      <description>Previously unknown artworks by masters are among more than 1,400 pieces found in a trove of Nazi-looted art in Munich, German officials say.</description>

      <body>Previously unknown artworks by masters are among more than 1,400 pieces found in a trove of Nazi-looted art in Munich, German officials say. As slides of the paintings were shown at a news conference, an expert said the works had been seized from private individuals or institutions. Previously unregistered works by Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse were found. Prosecutors said the issue of ownership was still being clarified. The total value has been estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Reinhard Nemetz, head of the prosecutors' office in Augsburg, said that 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works had been seized in the flat of Cornelius Gurlitt in Munich in March of last year. It was not yet clear if any offence had been committed, he added, stressing that the legal position was extremely complex. Investigators, he said, had turned up "concrete evidence" that at least some of the works had been seized by the Nazis from their owners or had been deemed "degenerate". Art expert Meike Hoffmann said some of the works were dirty but they had not been damaged. "When you stand before the works and see again these long-lost, missing works, that were believed destroyed, seeing them in quite good condition, it's an extraordinarily good feeling," Ms Hoffmann said. "The pictures are of exceptional quality, and have very special value for art experts. Many works were unknown until now." Other artists whose works were found include Pablo Picasso and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as Canaletto and Gustave Courbet. The paintings were found in March of last year after Mr Gurlitt was investigated for tax evasion. The framed pictures were stacked on a shelf, like in a museum storeroom while the unframed works were piled up in drawers, said customs official Siegfried Kloeble. According to a report by Germany's Focus magazine, Mr Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich, would occasionally sell a picture when he needed money. "We don't have any strong suspicion of a crime that would justify an arrest," said Mr Nemetz, adding that the current whereabouts of Mr Gurlitt were unknown. Asked at the news conference why the German authorities had taken so long to reveal the paintings, the prosecutor said it would have been "counter-productive to go public" with the case earlier. Mr Kloeble refused to say where the artworks were being stored. Mr Gurlitt's father Hildebrand collected early 20th Century art regarded by the Nazis as un-German or "degenerate", and removed from show in state museums. He was recruited by the Nazis to sell the "degenerate art" abroad but also bought privately. After the war he told investigators that his collection had been destroyed during the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. He also said he had been persecuted himself for having a Jewish grandmother. Resuming his work as a dealer, he died in a car crash in 1956. A Jewish group has questioned the length of time it took Germany to unveil the artworks and called for them to be returned to their original owners. "It cannot be, as in this case, that what amounts morally to the concealment of stolen goods continues," said Ruediger Mahlo, speaking for the Conference on Jewish material claims against Germany. Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the EU, told the BBC that time was running out, and the details of the artworks should be published. "Victims of the Holocaust are aging, even the families of those who did not survive are of an age," he said. "It's important that this be publicised. But the longer one goes... the more difficult it is for people to prepare potential claims... Justice delayed is justice denied." However, prosecutors say it would not be proper procedure to put things on the internet and people who want to make a claim should contact them directly. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Munich says that descendents of owners of art taken by German forces in occupied Europe may be able to make claims. However, there are suggestions that art taken in Germany itself may not be reclaimable because of a 30-year statute of limitations. Mr Mahlo said that private collections of such art under the Third Reich had been almost all Jewish. However, auctioneers have argued that at least some of the works were purchased cheaply in 1938 by Mr Gurlitt's father from a collection of state-owned art. In 1990, Cornelius Gurlitt auctioned works for 38,250 Swiss francs (31,000 euros) in Galerie Kornfeld, an auction house and gallery in the Swiss city of Bern. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galerie Kornfeld said: "Cornelius Gurlitt inherited the works after the death of his mother Helene. Basically this is a case of undeclared inheritance." </body>

      <title>Hunger Games sequel gets 12A rating</title>
      <description>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is rated 12A in the UK after censors passed it without cuts - unlike the first instalment.</description>

      <body>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the second instalment of the sci-fi film series, has been rated 12A after being passed uncut by censors. The BBFC report said the film contained "moderate violence and threat, and infrequent strong language". Cuts were made to the original Hunger Games film in 2012 in order to achieve a teen-friendly rating in the UK. The latest film, starring Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence, is out in the UK on 21 November. The BBFC report also revealed that the sequel, directed by Francis Lawrence, runs to 146 minutes and 2 seconds. The movie series is based on the best-selling trilogy of novels by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic America where adolescents fight to the death on live TV, the cast includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland. The first instalment of the franchise made £27.2m at the UK box office, and nearly $700 million (£441m) worldwide. It had faced a 15 certificate in the UK, until its distributor Lions Gate UK chose to make seven seconds of cuts - included the digital removal of "blood splashes" - in order to achieve a lower rating. "These cuts were made in addition to reductions already made following an earlier 'advice' viewing of an incomplete version," the BBFC noted at the time. In the US, The Hunger Games was rated PG-13 for "intense violent thematic material and disturbing images - all involving teens". Two further instalments in the series - both based on Collins' final novel The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - are due for release in November 2014 and November 2015. </body>

      <title>Sadler's Wells plans new dance venue</title>
      <description>Sadler's Wells announces plans to create a new venue that it hopes will help establish London as a global centre for dance to rival New York and Paris.</description>

      <body>Sadler's Wells plans to create a new venue it hopes will help establish London as a global centre for dance to rival New York and Paris. The search has begun for the site of the 500-seat theatre, which could open as early as 2018. Sadler's Wells' artistic director Alistair Spalding said the plan was a result of "frustration" with not having a medium-sized venue to stage work. "Dance is a really strong art form," he said. "We deserve proper spaces." Mr Spalding made the announcement on Tuesday as he unveiled a 10 Year Plan, which included investing £5 million in commissioning new dance work. "New York and Paris were seen as the leading centres of the art form. I believe that is no longer the case and my ambition is to make London the greatest centre for dance," he said. Fundraising for the new dance venue is due to begin in late 2014. Mr Spalding said the size of the new venue meant it would not make money, and would require some extra subsidy. He said it was too early to go into detail about the budget, but it was "not anywhere near" a suggested £100m. "The public appetite for dance has never been greater. We want to respond to this, and give the creative talent in this country a proper chance to develop for the future growth of the art form. "To achieve this, we need to be able to expand beyond our current base - without losing the unique quality and atmosphere that is associated with Sadler's Wells," Mr Spalding said. He said the new theatre would not be "luxurious", but "a contemporary space that young audiences will enjoy". The new theatre will work in tandem with Sadler's Wells' three existing theatres: The 1,500-seat main house and 150-seat Lilian Baylis Studio, in Islington, north London; and the 1,000-seat Peacock Theatre in the West End. Since its major, lottery-funded rebuild in 1998, more than 4.5 million people have visited Sadler's Wells. According to the new annual report, the dance house raised £23.8 million in 2012/13 and for every £1 of subsidy generated £10. Highlights of the 2014 Spring/Summer season include Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, who visit in February with 1980, a rarely-performed piece by Pina Bausch; and Brasil Brasileiro, a World Cup-inspired show with 35 performers from Rio de Janeiro. </body>

      <body>The Grand Budapest Hotel, the latest film from US writer and director Wes Anderson, will open the 2014 Berlinale film festival in February. The film's ensemble cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Jude Law. Set in a famous European hotel between the wars, it tells the story of a stolen priceless painting and was partly filmed in Germany. Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom opened Cannes Film Festival in 2012. "With unmistakeable Wes Anderson charm, this comedy promises to kick things off in a big way," said Berlinale festival director Dieter Kosslick of Anderson's new film. Its world premiere will launch the 11-day event in Berlin on 6 February, the first major European film festival of the year. Three-time Oscar nominee Anderson has a large cult following thanks to films such as The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and the stop-motion animation Fantastic Mr Fox, based on Roald Dahl's book of the same name. The British-German co-production also stars Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saoirse Ronan and Jason Schwartzman. The off-beat story follows the adventures of a legendary hotel concierge, played by Fiennes, and the bell boy who becomes his most trusted friend. It premiered its first trailer online last month. The Berlin Film Festival runs from 6 to 16 February 2014. </body>

      <body>Actress Olivia Colman has confirmed she will star in the second series of the hugely successful ITV detective drama Broadchurch, reprising her role as detective sergeant Ellie Miller. The murder mystery gripped ITV viewers in April, with a peak audience of 8.9 million viewers. The drama about the death of an 11-year-old boy also won critical acclaim. Double Bafta-winner Colman said her return was "set in stone" but added she would not be in the US remake. Her Broadchurch co-star David Tennant is reportedly starring in the US version, which is expected to begin filming in January for broadcast on the Fox network during the 2014-2015 season. Colman, who is also currently filming the return of BBC Two comedy Rev, said how "lucky" she felt to be doing a wide range of roles. "I've always enjoyed my work and I'm lucky to be doing it - yes, I feel lucky," she said. She won two Baftas in May for her roles in Accused and Twenty Twelve. Colman and Tennant also won best actor and actress for Broadchurch at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards in October, while co-star Andrew Buchan was named best supporting actor. The series also took home the award for best TV programme. The drama is also being adapted into a novel, according to The Daily Telegraph, which said the rights have been bought by Little, Brown Book Group. Scriptwriter Chris Chibnall is said to be co-writing the book with British psychological thriller author Erin Kelly. The newspaper said it will be published in August 2014. </body>

      <body>Christopher Jefferies, the landlord wrongly held over the 2010 murder of landscape architect Joanna Yeates, is to have his story dramatised by ITV. Written by Peter Morgan and directed by Roger Michell, The Lost Honour is now filming in Bristol. Jason Watkins, from BBC Three's Being Human, will play the former teacher. Michell, a former pupil of Jefferies', said the two-part drama would be "a vivid and ultimately uplifting account of a man who was wrongly accused". "It's a story that celebrates our right to be eccentric," continued the director of Notting Hill and Le Week-end. "It also, as it happens, is the story of a rather brilliant man who was once my English teacher." "No one will ever forget the man with the eccentric hair who became so connected with the murder of Joanna Yeates," said Morgan, Bafta-winning writer of Frost/Nixon and The Queen. "I want to make sure that no-one forgets the same man who was acquitted, and who fought back to clear his name, and became a very British kind of hero." Mr Jefferies was arrested after the 25-year-old was found dead in December 2010 but was eliminated from the inquiry several months later. His detention over the murder sparked massive press interest and he later successfully sued a number of newspapers for libel. In 2011, he told the Leveson inquiry into media ethics that the media had "shamelessly vilified" him and that there had been a "frenzied campaign to blacken his character". Earlier this year, Christopher Jefferies received a letter from Avon and Somerset Police apologising for the distress he suffered during the probe into Yeates' death. He is set to be played in the drama by actor Jason Watkins, a member of the National Theatre company who has previously starred in Doctor Who and The Wrong Mans. Dutch engineer Vincent Tabak, Ms Yeates' neighbour, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years in October 2011 after being found guilty of her murder. </body>

      <body>Former Velvet Underground frontman Lou Reed, who died after complications from a liver transplant on 27 October, has left his estate to his wife and other relatives, his will has revealed. He left his Manhattan penthouse, his home in East Hampton, New York, and the bulk of his estate to his wife, musician Laurie Anderson. His sister inherited about a quarter of his estate and a $500,000 (£313,185) bequest to care for their mother. Reed was 71 and had no children. The rocker married long-time partner Anderson in 2008. Tributes flooded in for Reed at the news of his death, including one from David Bowie who declared: "He was a master," and Reed's former Velvet Underground bandmate John Cale, who said: "The world has lost a fine songwriter and poet." Reed's second solo album Transformer, featuring Perfect Day and Walk on the Wild Side, was co-produced by Bowie. Other stars paying tribute included Iggy Pop, The Who, Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx, US singer Cyndi Lauper, Tom Morello, of Rage Against the Machine, actress Mia Farrow, British author Salman Rushdie and US actors Whoopi Goldberg and Samuel L Jackson. The Velvet Underground became renowned for their fusion of art and music and for collaborating with Andy Warhol. Although the band never achieved commercial success during the 1960s, their influence on music in later decades was widely recognised. The glam, punk and alternative rock movements of the 1970s, 80s and 90s were all indebted to Reed, whose songs were covered by the likes of REM, Bowie, Nirvana, Patti Smith and countless others. Music producer Brian Eno once summed up their influence by saying: "The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies, but everyone who bought it formed a band." The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1996. After quitting The Velvet Underground in 1970, Reed released his self-titled debut in 1972, but it wasn't until the Bowie-produced LP Transformer later that year that he achieved chart success. Perfect Day enjoyed a revival in 1996 when it was featured in Danny Boyle's Trainspotting, and again a year later when it was re-recorded by a celebrity cast for a BBC charity single. As a solo artist, Reed released 20 studio albums. His last, Hudson River Wind Meditations, was released in 2007. </body>

      <body>An episode of BBC Two's Secret History of Our Streets about Deptford High Street has won two prizes at the Grierson British Documentary awards. The programme, about how a thriving market became one of the poorest areas in London, won the reader's choice award and best historical documentary. Radio Times readers voted for their favourite in the magazine's poll. Artist Grayson Perry was named best documentary presenter for his All in the Best Possible Taste on Channel 4. The prestigious best documentary series award went to David Nath and James Newton for BBC Four's The Year the Town Hall Shrank, which followed the effects of the economic downturn in Stoke-on-Trent. Most entertaining documentary went to Nina Conti for her "mockumentary" Nina Conti: A Ventriloquist's Story - Her Master's Voice. Other winners included Ben Anthony's one-off documentary 7/7: One Day in London, which won the best documentary on a contemporary theme award. It focused on the aftermath of the London bombings in 2005 when 52 people died and more than 700 were injured in the capital. The judges, lead by Emma Loach, praised the film as "tender and profoundly moving". The programme won best single documentary at this year's Bafta TV awards. Film-maker John Battsek took home the coveted Grierson Trustees Award. Battsek set up Passion Pictures in 1999 and has gone on to produce more than 25 documentary features including Searching for Sugar Man, which won a best documentary Oscar earlier this year. Channel 4's Syria: Across the Lines won best current affairs documentary, while best arts documentary went to BBC One's Imagine: The Fatwa - Salman's Story, about award-winning author Salman Rushdie. The ceremony took place on Monday evening at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on London's Southbank and was hosted by TV presenter and journalist Claudia Winkleman. The awards can be seen on Sky Atlantic HD on Thursday at 21:00 GMT. </body>

      <title>Downton Abbey 'can help UK business'</title>
      <description>The popularity of the Royal Family and the TV drama Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers are told.</description>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <title>Perry album a bio-hazard down under</title>
      <description>Bio-security officers in Australia are ordered to inspect copies of Katy Perry's new album purchased overseas, as the packet of seeds it contains could break customs laws.</description>

      <body>Bio-security officers in Australia have been ordered to inspect any copies of Katy Perry's new album arriving into the country from overseas. The Department of Agriculture fears small packets of seeds given away with Prism could pose a risk to the country. The Australian release is believed to contain harmless locally-sourced seeds. However, the department told news.com.au that international versions are a "bio-security concern" and will be searched on arrival in the country. "The Australian government has a strong system in place to detect and respond to material of bio-security concern," said a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture. "This includes the inspection of mail, cargo and baggage." The deluxe version of Perry's album Prism, which is currently number one in Australia's Aria chart, contains a small packet of seeds which the US singer encourages fans to plant. Her production company has assured officials that the Australian release contains Swan River daisy seeds from the west of the country, however fans can still purchase copies from abroad online. The US version is available for under $19 (£12) from eBay including shipping, according to Billboard.com, while the Australian version retails for $24.99 (£15). Australia's strict customs laws mean the US copies could be confiscated. "Seeds or plant material of international origin may be a weed not present in Australia or the host of a plant pathogen of bio-security concern," said a department spokesperson. They continued: "Our bio-security officers at international airports, seaports and mail centres assess the risks associated with various items every day and are well-trained in making informed decisions about whether items could be of bio-security concern." </body>

      <body>Author Lucy Hughes-Hallett has won the Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction for her biography of philandering Italian poet and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio. The Pike "transcends the conventions of biography", the judges said. Hughes-Hallett was announced as the winner in a ceremony at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London on Monday night. The prize, now in its 15th year, is worth £20,000. Hughes-Hallett's book beat Charles Moore's Margaret Thatcher: The Authorized Biography, Volume One: Not for Turning and Dave Goulson's A Sting In The Tale, about the mysterious ways of the bumblebee. Also on the shortlist were Empires of the Dead by David Crane; Return of a King by William Dalrymple and Under Another Sky by Charlotte Higgins. The Pike, published by 4th Estate, tells the life story of D'Annunzio, an Italian artist and womaniser who became a national hero and radical right-wing revolutionary. "Readers of The Pike will surely admire Lucy Hughes-Hallett's writing, and her intricate crafting of the narrative," said Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal and chair of judges. "Her original experimentation with form transcends the conventions of biography. "And they will be transfixed by her vivid portrayal of D'Annunzio - how this repellent egotist quickly gained literary celebrity - and how, thereafter, his incendiary oratory, and foolhardy bravery influenced Italy's involvement in World War One and the subsequent rise of Mussolini. "The book shows how fascism rose partly as a perversion of nationalism - a trend still sadly relevant in today's world." Rees's fellow judges were historians Mary Beard and Peter Hennessy; director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti; and writer and reviewer James McConnachie. In a recent interview with BBC Radio 4's World at One, Hughes-Hallett said that what interested her about D'Annunzio was that he was "incredibly quick on picking up on an innovative literary form or a new hairstyle or - more importantly - a new political philosophy". "Writing about him meant that I was writing about the entire cultural ambience in which he lived," she said. "He was a decadent and he was a great enjoyer the good things of life - flowers and poetry and sex, he was an enthusiastic and surprisingly successful seducer." Hughes-Hallett's previous books are Cleopatra: Histories, Dreams and Distortions and Heroes: Saviours, Traitors and Supermen. Jonathan Ruppin, web editor for Foyles bookshops, said: "As well as being a much-needed modern analysis of a dangerously charismatic figure, the book stands as an eloquent riposte to all those who talk of the death of serious biography. "Hughes-Hallett ignores no aspect of his fulcral role in the rise of Italian fascism." The Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction is open to books in the areas of current affairs, history, politics, science, sport, travel, biography, autobiography and the arts. Last year's winner was Wade Davis's book Into the Silence: The Great War, Mallory and the Conquest of Everest, about explorer George Mallory's attempt to conquer Everest. </body>

      <body>French writer Gerard de Villiers, whose thrillers sold more than 100m copies around the world, has died aged 83. De Villiers died after a long illness, his lawyer said. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May. He was the creator of the popular SAS series, with an Austrian hero often seen as France's literary James Bond. Drawing on his network of intelligence sources around the world, De Villiers was famous for his uncanny knack of anticipating actual events. "The last weeks he was conscious but very weak," de Villiers' wife, Christine, told the AFP news agency. "It is exactly the death that he did not want," she added. De Villiers's SAS series became a publishing phenomenon in France, Germany, Russia, Turkey and Japan, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports. The series starred a fiercely anti-Communist Austrian aristocrat called Malko Linge, who worked as a freelance CIA agent. The SAS initials came from Linge's honorific Son Altesse Serenissime (His Most Serene Highness). De Villiers was inspired by Ian Fleming's James Bond but felt that no-one would believe in a French spy hero - so instead created Malko Linge, our correspondent says. With covers invariably featuring a semi-naked woman with a gun they have been a staple of railway station book shops, selling by the million. Starting in 1965, de Villiers churned books out at a rate of four a year. His last and 200th book - SAS: The Kremlin's Revenge - was released last month. "I never had any pretensions of being a literary writer," the writer admitted in an interview with the AFP last year. "I consider myself a storyteller who writes to amuse people." </body>

      <body>Irene Kane, the female lead in Stanley Kubrick's 1955 film Killer's Kiss, has died in New York of pancreatic cancer. Kane, who later co-authored celebrity autobiographies under her married name Chris Chase, played a dancer who falls for a boxer in Kubrick's crime drama. The actress would later say it was "a silly movie" that had been made "with no money [and] no names". Kane, who died on 31 October, went on to appear on Broadway and on television before moving into journalism. According to the Hollywood Reporter, her family declined to confirm her age at the time of her death. The former model was married in 1962 to television producer Michael Chase, the son of Pulitzer-winning playwright Mary. She went on to co-author the autobiographies of actress Rosalind Russell, comedian Alan King and one-time First Lady Betty Ford. Kubrick, whose later films would include Dr Strangelove, 2001: a Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, died in 1999. </body>

      <title>Scorsese and Hockney honoured in LA</title>
      <description>Film director Martin Scorsese and artist David Hockney are honoured at a star-studded event in Los Angeles.</description>

      <body>Film director Martin Scorsese and artist David Hockney have been honoured at a star-studded event at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma). The pair were honourees at the museum's annual Art+Film Gala, designed to bring the two industries closer together. Scorsese was praised for helping to save the museum's film programme from being cut and for his work on film restoration. Hockney was recognised for the way he captured the city through his artwork. "I first arrived in Los Angeles, almost 50 years ago in January 1964, and they were just putting up this building," the 76-year-old, who lived in California for nearly three decades, said in a brief speech. "It's the only encyclopaedic museum in Southern California and deserves your support." The artist's Seven Yorkshire Landscape Videos exhibition - created by mounting cameras to a car while he drove through the countryside - is currently on show at Lacma. The gala raised $4.1m (£2.6m) for Lacma's film programme, which was first introduced in 1965, but was hit by the financial crisis in 2009 and was forced to stop its weekend screenings. At the time, Scorsese was a vocal critic of the move and wrote an open letter to museum director Michael Govan saying he was "deeply disturbed" at the decision. "Marty was very vocal when we announced that we were pausing our film programme a few years ago during the economic meltdown," Mr Govan said at the gala. "When he learned that we really wanted to rebuild and expand our programme, he was the first person who offered to help." Scorsese has been an advocate for film preservation and founded The Film Foundation in 1990 to help the cause. The Goodfellas director also presented the restoration of four films by French film-maker Agnes Varda at the gala and appealed for help in preserving film from the ravages of time. "What is cinema? For me there is only one answer. Cinema is necessary. Please don't forget it," he said. Stars at the event, hosted by Leonardo DiCaprio, included Tom Hanks, Drew Barrymore, James Franco and Warren Beatty, while Sting provided the night's entertainment. </body>

      <title>Ender's Game tops US box office</title>
      <description>Sci-fi adventure Ender's Game debuts at the top of the US box office chart.</description>

      <body>Sci-fi adventure Ender's Game has zoomed to the top of the US box office chart in its debut weekend. Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, about an 86-year-old and his eight-year-old grandson, was shunted into second after hitting the number one spot last week. Ender's Game, a story about children forced to fight an enemy race, took $28m (£17.5m) according to estimates. The film stars Harrison Ford as a commander who manipulates a young boy (Asa Butterfield) into leading a war. Double Oscar nominee Viola Davis plays Ford's second in command. Based on the best-selling 1985 novel of the same name, Ender's Game was in line with box office forecasts which predicted it would take between $25m (£15.6m) and $30m (£18.8m) in its opening weekend. This was despite calls by some to boycott the film after the book's author, Orson Scott Card, made some comments expressing his opposition to gay marriage. But with the highly anticipated Thor: The Dark World opening next week, box office analyst Jeff Bock said: "It looks like Ender's Game is one-and-done... (next weekend) there won't be much of the box office pie left for Ender's Game." Last Vegas, featuring an all-star cast including Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline, opened in third place with $16.5m (£10.3m). Rentrak's Paul Dergarabedian said: "It's interesting to see the number of stars that are not in their 20s in the top films. "Ender's Game has Harrison Ford and Viola Davis, and Last Vegas is like a Hangover for the older crowd. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney - in Gravity - appeal to an older audience, and 12 Years a Slave... is a very sophisticated drama." Children's animation Free Birds, which features the voices of Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson and Amy Poehler, debuted in fourth spot with takings of $16.2m (£10.1m). Gravity, now in its fifth week, rounded out the top five. Thor: The Dark World, which opened in the UK last Wednesday, beat all contenders at the UK and Ireland box office this weekend, earning £8.65m in its first five days in cinemas. Even without previews it was the comfortable victor, taking £5.54m between Friday and Sunday according to Screen International. According to its distributor Walt Disney, its weekend takings exceeded the entire first week box office of the first Thor in April 2011. Last week's top film, animated sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, fell to second place with a second weekend tally of £2.1m. </body>

      <body>Scottish singer Annie Lennox has been honoured with the 22nd Music Industry Trusts Award. Lennox accepted the award for her "outstanding contribution to British music" and her charity work. The former Eurythmics frontwoman is one of the UK's most successful solo artists, selling in excess of 80 million records and winning eight Brit awards. Paying tribute, singer Adele called her "an example of a brilliant talent". "So many of her songs have been the soundtrack to my life," she added. More than 1200 guests attended the charity event in Aid of Nordoff Robbins and The BRIT Performing Arts and Technology School. Lennox, 58, said she was "very touched and honoured" to receive the award. "Music has given me a lifetime of experiences and opportunities that I would never have dreamed possible, and I feel very privileged to have been able to become an artist and communicator, especially as a woman." She performed a number of her hit singles including There Must Be An Angel, No More I Love You's and Here Comes The Rain Again. Born in Aberdeen, Lennox trained at the Royal Academy of Music before becoming lead singer of the band The Tourists. Along with her fellow band member Dave Stewart, she went on to form the Eurythmics, who enjoyed a string of hits throughout the 80s. Lennox released her acclaimed debut solo album Diva in 1992 and went on to record Medusa in 1995, both of which topped the UK album chart. In 2004, she won an Oscar for her song Into the West which appeared in the Lord of the Rings film sequel, The Return of the King. Lennox's charity work includes her support of Greenpeace and Amnesty International but she is best known for her work fighting Aids. In 2007 she established the SING campaign, dedicated to raising funds and awareness for women and children affected by HIV and Aids. In 2010, Lennox was named as a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador for Aids. In another recorded tribute, Archbishop Desmond Tutu called her "one of those exemplary human beings who chose to put her success in her chosen career to work in order to benefit others", adding "she is a true friend of Africa and of South Africa." Sir Elton John called the award "well deserved" while actor Stephen Fry added: "She shines, that's what she does, she has her lustre and gleam. As a humanitarian, Annie stands alone." Pretenders singer Chrissie Hynde said: "The world is a better place when you sing." The Music Industry Trusts Award has raised over £4.5 million for Nordoff Robbins and the BRIT Trust. Past recipients include Sir George Martin, Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber and Sir Tom Jones. </body>

      <body>The first ever YouTube awards have been held in New York, with actor Jason Schwartzman and musician Reggie Watts presiding over a frenetic ceremony. As YouTube is a video-sharing site, the event featured Eminem, Lady Gaga and M.I.A making live music videos directed by the awards' creator, Spike Jonze, and others. Eminem won Artist of the Year, while Taylor Swift's I Knew You Were Trouble took the YouTube Phenomenon award. The ceremony was streamed live online. Nominees were chosen by taking into account the YouTube views, likes, comments and subscription figures for different artists. Indie actress Greta Gerwig kicked off proceedings at the sprawling Pier 36 venue, performing in a live video for Arcade Fire and their new song Afterlife. Lady Gaga was up next, tears rolling down her cheeks as she performed her single Dope for the first time wearing a baseball cap and flannel shirt. The coveted Video of the Year award went to South Korean group Girls' Generation for their song I Got A Boy, while Innovation of the Year went to DeStorm Power, the YouTube user whose 250 videos on the website have been watched more than 200 million times. The inaugural YouTube awards reflect an increasing trend for people to turn to the internet, rather than television and radio, for music and video. In August last year, the Nielsen rating agency published a survey in which 64% of American adolescents said they listened to music on YouTube, compared with 56% who listened to radio. </body>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to take no action against Downton Abbey over its contentious rape storyline, despite receiving 244 complaints from viewers. The regulator said it had decided not to pursue the complaints "after careful assessment... because they did not raise issues warranting investigation." Some viewers complained to ITV about the storyline, which saw housemaid Anna attacked and raped by a guest's valet. The broadcaster received 200 complaints after the show was aired on 6 October. A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes was broadcast before the episode, which was seen by an audience of almost 12 million. An Ofcom spokesperson said the warning had been into account, as well as the fact that the controversial scene was broadcast after the 9pm watershed. The fact that the attack itself took place off-screen also played a part in the regulator's decision. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended the storyline and its treatment, insisting it was neither gratuitous nor sensationalist. "Downton deals in subjecting a couple of characters per series to a very difficult situation and you get the emotions that come out of these traumas," he told the BBC. Joanne Froggatt, who plays Anna May Bates, has also defended the plotline, saying she was "proud" the show could tackle such a weighty subject. The fourth series of Downton Abbey reaches its conclusion on Sunday. </body>

      <description>Netflix tests "ultra high definition" video streaming as it looks to launch a full service to users in 2014.</description>

      <body>Netflix, the TV and film streaming service, has started testing "ultra high definition" video. Also known as 4K the technology offers four times the amount of detail as 1080p high-definition content. Netflix said it plans to offer the first titles in 4K to customers next year. But some analysts question whether broadband speeds in the UK are fast enough to cope with ultra high definition streaming. "Average broadband speeds in the UK are 7.6 megabits per second, you would need to have at least double that speed to watch 4K reliably on a streamed basis," says IHS broadband analyst, Richard Broughton. "Currently only 15% to 20% of households have the speeds necessary." Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of "superfast" speeds, defined by Ofcom watchdog as 30Mbps or above. Craig Nelson, spokesman for the Internet Service Providers' Association, told the BBC: "We think streaming of 4K TV services will require minimum broadband speeds of about 100Mbps to work properly, but only businesses, production houses and a limited number of homes currently have that kind of speed. "A lot will depend on the compression technologies, or codecs, service providers use. "The real hindrance won't be broadband speeds but the availability of screens." Only a few manufacturers currently make 4K TVs and, as with all cutting-edge technologies, they are expensive. For example, Panasonic's 65in LED 4K TV costs £5,500, while Sony's equivalent costs £5,000. </body>

      <body>Marcia Wallace, the late actress who provided the voice of schoolteacher Edna Krabappel in The Simpsons, has been remembered in its latest episode. Sunday's edition of the series began with Bart Simpson at the blackboard, standing beneath the poignant message: "We'll really miss you Mrs. K." Wallace died of complications from pneumonia on 25 October at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 70. The actress won an Emmy in 1992 for her work on the long-running animated show. Sunday's edition of The Simpsons was preceded on the Fox channel in the US by a re-run of 2011 episode The Ned-liest Catch. Wallace appeared in 178 episodes in all, voicing grumpy fourth-grade teacher Edna in all but three of them. The actress's death was confirmed on 26 October by The Simpsons' executive producer Al Jean, who said she had been "brilliant and gracious". "She was beloved by all at The Simpsons and we intend to retire her irreplaceable character," he said in a message on Facebook. </body>

      <title>Why Hitler put 'degenerate' art on show</title>
      <description>Why the Nazis put on a show of 'degenerate' art</description>

      <body>This week it was revealed that a huge stash of modern art had been found in a flat in Munich. Many of the paintings were considered "degenerate" by the Nazis, who staged an exhibition especially to ridicule them. Why did Hitler hate abstract art so much? In July 1937, four years after it came to power, the Nazi party put on two art exhibitions in Munich. The Great German Art Exhibition was designed to show works that Hitler approved of - depicting statuesque blonde nudes along with idealised soldiers and landscapes. The second exhibition, just down the road, showed the other side of German art - modern, abstract, non-representational - or as the Nazis saw it, "degenerate". The Degenerate Art Exhibition included works by some of the great international names - Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Wassily Kandinsky - along with famous German artists of the time such Max Beckmann, Emil Nolde and Georg Grosz. The exhibition handbook explained that the aim of the show was to "reveal the philosophical, political, racial and moral goals and intentions behind this movement, and the driving forces of corruption which follow them". Works were included "if they were abstract or expressionistic, but also in certain cases if the work was by a Jewish artist," says Jonathan Petropoulos, professor of European History at Claremont McKenna College and author of several books on art and politics in the Third Reich. He says the exhibition was laid out with the deliberate intention of encouraging a negative reaction. "The pictures were hung askew, there was graffiti on the walls, which insulted the art and the artists, and made claims that made this art seem outlandish, ridiculous." British artist Robert Medley went to see the show. "It was enormously crowded and all the pictures hung like some kind of provincial auction room where the things had been simply slapped up on the wall regardless to create the effect that this was worthless stuff," he says. Hitler had been an artist before he was a politician - but the realistic paintings of buildings and landscapes that he preferred had been dismissed by the art establishment in favour of abstract and modern styles. So the Degenerate Art Exhibition was his moment to get his revenge. He had made a speech about it that summer, saying "works of art which cannot be understood in themselves but need some pretentious instruction book to justify their existence will never again find their way to the German people". The Nazis claimed that degenerate art was the product of Jews and Bolsheviks, although only six of the 112 artists featured in the exhibition were actually Jewish. The art was divided into different rooms by category - art that was blasphemous, art by Jewish or communist artists, art that criticised German soldiers, art that offended the honour of German women. One room featured entirely abstract paintings, and was labelled "the insanity room". "In the paintings and drawings of this chamber of horrors there is no telling what was in the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or the pencil," reads the entry in the exhibition handbook. The idea of the exhibition was not just to mock modern art, but to encourage the viewers to see it as a symptom of an evil plot against the German people. The curators went to some lengths to get the message across, hiring actors to mingle with the crowds and criticise the exhibits. The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors - three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition. Some realised it could be their last chance to see this kind of art in Germany, while others endorsed Hitler's views. Many people also came because of the air of scandal around the show - and it wasn't just Nazi sympathisers who found the art off-putting. Fritz Lustig was a young Jewish apprentice who went along to see the works of art. He says "they didn't seem to mean very much - if they were portraits they seemed to distort the faces... if they were things, they seemed to be quite different from what the things really looked like - I mean the word degenerate seemed to me to apply". The exhibition went on tour all over Germany, where it was seen by a million more people. Some of the art was later burned by the Nazis, and for many of the artists this was only the beginning of very hard times ahead. But Petropoulos says that for some, being banned by the Nazis turned out to have a positive side. "This artwork became more attractive abroad, or certainly in anti-Nazi circles it gained values because the Nazis opposed it, and I think that over the longer run it was good for modern art to be viewed as something that the Nazis detested and hated." Some of the artists featured in the exhibition are now considered among the greats of modern art. Lustig, who later fled the Nazis to settle in England, now enjoys the art that he once thought was degenerate. "Well, I have grown up since that - I was pretty young and I hadn't seen all that much art - I've changed my mind since then," he says. "I can appreciate modern art much better now than I did then. It's not meant to be beautiful is it?" Lucy Burns was reporting for Witness - which airs weekdays on BBC World Service radio. You can hear her report on degenerate art here.

      <title>John Waters: 'I wanted to be the filthiest person alive'</title>
      <description>Cult director John Waters says Hollywood comedies are 'gross'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24806639</url>

      <body>When John Waters was a little boy in Baltimore growing up amidst the strict moral values of 1950s America, he fantasised about growing up to run a porn film theatre: "I knew what I wanted to be - the filthiest person alive." But the cult director and writer, who set out to shock with subversive, darkly comic films such as Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Pecker, says he is now struck by the scale of "obscene" content on screen - particularly the treatment of women in films and porn. He noted with interest a recent interview with Tom Hanks, who said he was "amazed" by how "filthy" mainstream comedy had become. The Guardian asked Hanks whether it would be impossible to remake his 1988 film Big - about a 12-year-old boy who wishes himself into an adult body - because the protagonist has sex with an older woman. Actually, the star said, an update would be far "raunchier". Waters sympathises, and shudders. "Hollywood now does do bad taste," he tells BBC Radio 3 ahead of his appearance at Liverpool's Homotopia festival, "and mostly they do it badly". "I liked The Hangover. I liked Bridesmaids. It's something they do great. But what do you think of as American humour now? Mostly you think of a big, Hollywood gross-out movie. And they aren't funny, they're just gross. "It's easy to do that. It's simple to do that. But to have wit and to have you [the viewer] change how you think about something - which I always try to do... I'm not saying I was successful but Pink Flamingos, it still plays. It's still successful. It didn't get politically correct." The low-budget director - whose soubriquets include 'pope of trash" and "prince of puke" - also finds modern internet porn depressing and unsettling. That may come as a surprise. After all, Waters chose a gay "outsider" pornographer as one of the Role Models in his 2010 book of the same name. But he acknowledges there is a huge gulf between the innocent 10-year-old boy who knew the titles of dirty books and sneaked them from under the counter at the library, and the unfiltered internet porn that children can stumble across today. "I agree that some porn is obscene today," he says. "Someone said 'it's not making love, it's making hate'. Especially heterosexual porn. "I think in the gay porn you can tell they're both in on it. In some of the hetero porn [with] the [treatment of] women you cannot tell. But that is the limits of free speech we have to put up with." 'Stupid people' In most of Waters' films, there's as much male as female nudity and the unrealistic sex is played for laughs. Even though the likes of Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Desperate Living (his rather charming attempt at a lesbian Disney fairytale) feature cannibalism, rape, child abuse and castration, good always triumphs and a wild revenge is wreaked with the chopping off of homemade rubber body parts amidst huge splatters of fake blood. "In Female Trouble there's a scene where Divine has sex with himself. But you know Divine's playing both roles… it's always so ludicrous. Sexual abuse is always punished." There is a striking contrast, he says, between Pink Flamingos' good natured attempt to shock, and the forensically detailed, realistic violence of so-called 'torture porn' films like Saw and equally mainstream fare as The Killer Inside Me (2010) - a film rated R despite its depiction of what the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) called "disturbing brutal violence, aberrant sexual content and some graphic nudity". If anything makes Waters angry it's "stupid people" and that includes some of the film censors he's had to deal with: "In the early days censors made my career. I made my career on negative reviews. Though the scariest was the censor board here in the UK. They said [of Pink Flamingos] 'We don't know how to deal with intentional bad taste.'" But for Cry Baby (1990) - his big Hollywood commission after the success of Hairspray! - Waters was obligated to bring it in with a PG 13 rating to ensure Johnny Depp's young fans could see it. That meant lots of cuts. After the success of R-rated Serial Mom (1994) - "a satirical presentation of strong violence, vulgar language, and sexual episodes" - and 1998's Pecker - "sexuality, graphic nudity, language and brief drug use" - Waters put up a fight over the rating given to A Dirty Shame (2003) starring Johnny Knoxville and Tracy Ullman. The comedy about sex addicts which contained no actual sex and no violence was not well received critically, but most importantly it was rated NC-17 - an adult certificate that is commercial death in the US. "Your film is really ruined by that because there are theatres that won't play it." He thinks the film's reception was affected by the concurrent outrage over the Abu Ghraib prison abuse photos. "I think Iraq had something to do with it. People really didn't think that weird sex stuff was funny then in America. "I appealed [the rating] and I lost the case. "I'm not saying it would have been a success with an R rating, but it did hurt it. And it's amazing to me how in America it's still very uptight about sex and pro-violence and in Europe it's usually the other way round." Waters has just finished a book about hitchhiking across America on his own (due out next June) which he said proved a heartwarming experience, apart from the occasional 10-hour waits. Most of his lifts came he said from "straight men who'd been through something bad in their lives like drugs but come through it and now loved their wives." What did he learn? "The basic goodness of people which I've always believe in. I'm an optimist. Yes, terrible things can happen. It didn't happen to me." Waters has been fascinated by high profile criminal cases since the Manson Family murders. He says he and his mother are following the hacking trial involving former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks with great interest. And he now regards himself as a "filth elder" - and spends much of his year touring universities giving talks about his career to students. So what does he make of Miley Cyrus - surely a girl just trying to shock and get away from her 'clean teen' past, like many of the heroines in his films? It's a rare moment when Waters looks unimpressed. "I'm not interested in her. I don't dislike her. I don't care about her. She's certainly not scandalising me. "I still think you can be a rock star and act bad, but it has to be in a new way." John Waters is still fighting the war on taste. But he has standards, you know. BBC Radio 3 will broadcast a full interview with John Waters at 10:00 GMT on Wednesday, 6 November as part of the Free Thinking season. </body>

      <title>Rizzle Kicks rant at rap misogyny</title>
      <description>'Hip-hop is misogynistic and homophobic'</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70903000/jpg/_70903762_rizzle_624.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Rizzle Kicks are arguably the biggest hip-hop act in the UK, with two top 10 albums and a contemporary pop classic in the shape of Mama Do The Hump. But the duo tell the BBC they're not too pleased with the state of rap music. "I can't listen to hip-hop at the moment," says Jordan Stephens. "I really struggle." Stephens is the Rizzle in Rizzle Kicks - the cheeky scamps of British rap, formed in Brighton five years ago. Grounded in hip-hop's "golden age" of laid-back grooves and dusty jazz samples, Stephens is decidedly unimpressed by his contemporaries. "The stuff I'm hearing in the mainstream... it's overly-misogynistic and it's still homophobic," he says. "It does my head in." As a hip-hop scholar, the 21-year-old is aware that homophobia is a running theme in the genre. Rapper's Delight, the first rap song to make the US top 40, featured a bizarre put-down of Superman: "He's a fairy I do suppose / Flying through the air in pantyhose". But, as recently as last month, Eminem's Rap God won five star reviews despite lyrics like: "You fags think its all a game". Stephens acknowledges that "turns of phrases take a while to die out". "But when it's vicious, I don't understand why you'd bother. Think of something more inventive to say. It's a cultural thing that needs to piss off, basically." "I think it's even worse for women. I had an ex-girlfriend who was seriously up on her hip-hop, and I played her this song Clique with Jay-Z, Kanye and Big Sean. The first lyric is 'I tell a bad bitch do whatever I say'. And she just turned around and said, 'what's that?'" "I don't think we know any women - smart women, who you'd want to be friends with, that would proclaim themselves as a bad bitch," he adds. "If anything, the only women I've seen saying 'bad bitch' seem pretty insecure." His anger feeds into the song This Means War, which opens the band's second album, Roaring 20s. "I don't want a bad bitch," spits Stephens over a thundering drum loop. "I want a chick that would slap up a guy if he calls her a bad bitch." He doesn't stop there, addressing the London riots ("some of the things that happened in Neasden weren't pleasing, the stabbings and beatings"). "We wanted to use our platform to mention some social observations," he says. "You listen to music on the radio and there's a lot of talk about love and partying and dancing. I thought it'd be interesting to have a tune that addresses things that are cultural." "We intend to do that more, actually," he continues. "The goal is, in however many years' time, to slowly and surely put in place the most alternative number one. Something unexpected. Something that has real significance." "Something that doesn't abide by normal pop rules," adds his bandmate, in a rare intervention. Harley "Sylvester" Alexander-Sule is the quietly-spoken half of the band - the one who'd like to brew a potion to make him "more confident in certain social situations", and who handles all the singing on their catchy, bouncy pop anthems. He dismisses the idea that Rizzle Kicks have "gone serious" on the new album. "I think a lot of it's still tongue-in-cheek, still. It's a step forward in terms of maturity, but that's just natural because we're growing up." Stephens and Alexander-Sule were childhood friends in North London, but lost touch until their teens - when they met by chance at a football match in Brighton, where their respective families had moved. Their musical career was forged during workshops at the Brighton-based music charity Audioactive, and they polished their act at the Brit School. Signed to Island Records off the back of a home-made YouTube video, their 2011 debut album Stereo Typical went platinum and earned the dubious honour of being the second most illegally downloaded album in the UK last year (after Ed Sheeran's +). The follow-up is called Roaring 20s, partly because the duo both turned 21 this year, but also in reference to the big band samples that pepper the record. "I went through a big phase last year, when I suddenly started listening to swing and jazz," says Stephens. "Every morning I'd listen Dave Brubeck's Take Five. I love that, and Mel Torme's Coming Home. Harley's always loved crooners, so it just came naturally." The party vibe extends to their live shows, played with a full live band - an antidote to the standard hip-hop set-up of turntables and "hype men", which Alexander-Sule dismisses as "boring". "When we started first, gigging around Brighton, we had our drummer Lou who'd play drums over a laptop track," he explains. "It was awfully prepared but it still had that live feel. And a lot of our music has samples based on live instruments - so it was a natural thing to use a live band." "Plus, we knew more musicians than DJs," adds Stephens. One of those musicians is his father, Herman, who plays bass and even provides vocals on the new album. "It says on Wikipedia that Damien Marley sang on our new album," grins Stephens. "Well, it wasn't Damien Marley, it was my dad!" Their concerts are boisterous, hands-in-the-air affairs. Schedules permitting, their mothers even appear on stage to recreate their dance moves from the Mama Do The Hump video. But Stephens emphasises the shows aren't PG-rated. "There was one show we did in Portsmouth," he says, "and on the front row there was a mum and a nine-year-old daughter". "I swore and she gave me a dirty look. I was like: 'Give me some slack! Don't bring your kid to a gig like this! Have you heard the album?" Alexander-Sule just doesn't understand why anyone would be upset. "I think swearing's great," he laughs, and hopes no-one is put off by an occasional, exuberant outburst. "We just run on stage and flip around," he says. "I think making people smile is more important than being cool." Rizzle Kicks' album, Roaring 20s, is out now, and the band tour the UK next February and March. </body>

      <title>Beck and Arcade Fire invite fans in</title>
      <description>How bands are using music videos to interact with fans online</description>

      <body>Picture the scene: you're at home watching the latest concert by your favourite musician. The crowd is raving, the singer approaches them holding the microphone out and a few people climb past security onto the stage. But alas, stuck in front of your computer screen, you can't join them. Except now you can - if you're a fan of American musician Beck, that is. He is one of a few artists making interactive music videos requiring fan participation. Throughout his 20-year career the industry has seen many changes, including more people now watching music videos on YouTube than on MTV. Beck has made many memorable music videos, though he started out with limited means. "[For] my first video we had no money," he says. "I had a friend who had film in the freezer left over from film school and we used that one roll of film. "Every frame was precious." The video in question was for his hit song Loser, which went on to sell half a million copies and became one of the defining singles of the 1990s. "I was surprised when some of these videos actually got played," he continues about his early releases. "Most of them were just friends who were making them and editing them." Since then the 43-year-old has collaborated with acclaimed directors such as Spike Jonze and Michael Gondry on his music videos. Earlier this year he took this one step further, developing a 360 degree experience with director Chris Milk. In Hello Again viewers can join Beck onstage or stroll around among the 170 musicians as they play David Bowie's Sound and Vision. Viewers move around by turning on their computer's webcam and moving their heads in the direction they want to move in. For Beck, music videos can create a strong connection between bands and fans in the digital age. "I grew up in an era where the packaging was such a big part of how you related to the music," he says. The cover of Psychocandy, the first Jesus and Mary Chain album, which has a bold design and stark red, white and black colour scheme, had an especially strong influence on how he related to the band and came to understand them. "It gave me enough information, it opened up a whole idea about where this music is coming from and what it was." He believes music videos can fulfil this role in today's digital era where there is less emphasis on physical records. "I felt that they were album artwork come to life," he says about these videos. The Google Creative Lab's Aaron Koblin has directed several interactive music videos. The 31-year-old heads the data arts team and grew up in the era of big budget videos which played a large role in teen culture, but says the fan was passive. "When I used to watch music videos it was very much 'I am receiving the content which is helping me understand and create a picture of the musician's identity'," he says. "But it didn't necessarily make me feel all that much closer." He thinks interactive web-based videos enable a new way of creating that bond. He has worked with Arcade Fire on videos that require fans to interact with the band. "I hope we can create a deeper emotional experience which will then help bring a better connection," he says. Together with director Vincent Morisset, he aimed to do just that with the Just A Reflektor project, which uses the title track from Arcade Fire's latest album. Fans connect their smartphone to their webcam via a unique code on the video's site. By moving their smartphone around viewers can change the visual effects on the video, creating sprinkles of light and colour. They also can guide the protagonist on her journey and eventually join her. "Your phone and computer are actually talking to each other," Mr Koblin says. "The computer is observing and talking about the phone's location and movement and in doing that is able to construct and change the story based around the way the phone is being moved around." While videos are increasingly being viewed on the internet, interactive web-based ones are still rare. Just A Reflektor uses new code and tools, that were specifically created for the Google Chrome browser. "These things aren't that easy to make yet," Mr Koblin explains. Creating these new tools is currently the most expensive part of making these videos. "That's part of why when we create them we're releasing a lot of the code that we used and a lot of the tools that we created so we can encourage other people to get involved." Arcade Fire have tried the interactive experience before in another experiment for Google Chrome. The song We Used To Wait was used by Mr Koblin and Mr Milk to become the interactive experience The Wilderness Downtown, which uses Google Earth to bring a new dimension to the song. Viewers type in their home address and will see images of where they grew up within the video. Jordan Gauthier is an Arcade Fire fan and says their interactive videos have strengthened his relationship with the band. He grew up in the French suburban town of Rennes and says The Wilderness Downtown made him relate to the song in a new way by helping him recall his childhood memories. "It's like putting your own memories into the video," he says. "I thought that was amazing." Ultimately Beck thinks the web opens up numerous possibilities to interact with fans. "I think that's an infinite idea," he says. "That kind of idea is going to spread because the technology exists." He points to the success of crowdfunding in other fields and thinks more videos will source their ideas and materials from fans in the future. Mr Koblin and Mr Milk crowdsourced for The Johnny Cash Project, which features the song Ain't No Grave. Released after Cash's death, the interactive site pays tribute to him through a video made up of stills drawn by fans. Viewers can then select and watch the frames in different orders. As material is continuously being added to the project, every viewing is unique. Crowdsourcing can also build closer bonds between fans themselves, according to British director Ninian Doff. He crowdsourced images of fans dancing to make the video for Graham Coxon's What It'll Take. One hundred fans sent in videos from 28 countries, and Mr Doff cut up all the videos for the final piece. "It's a big jumble," he explains. "Sometimes it's one person's legs and another person's top half, or it's one person's legs, one person's body, one person's head. "It's like making a Frankenstein out of fans' bodies." And people managed to find themselves and each other through leaving comments about the video online. "One person commented saying, 'Oh that's me at 2 minutes 5 seconds'," Mr Doff says. "Then another person replied, 'I'm your legs at 2 minutes 5 seconds'. "They'd managed to meet over the internet through being connected in the video." </body>

      <description>What Munich trove reveals about Nazi art collection</description>

      <body>The astonishing find in a Munich flat of 1,500 paintings missing since 1939 points to two art crimes. The first is Adolf Hitler's crusade to fill his Fuehrermuseum at Linz, Austria, with the supreme paintings of the world - looted, confiscated and purchased by the Nazis in the occupied countries of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia. The second is the crime of covering up the truth ever since. Cornelius Gurlitt, 80, whose hoard of paintings in Munich was allegedly hidden behind a wall of ancient cans of food, has kept his secrets for 68 years. What they tell us about Hitler is more important than what they reveal about Gurlitt. His pictures descend from his father, Hildebrand, one of four senior Modern Art dealers in Germany who were appointed in March 1938 to the Nazis' Confiscation Committee - with orders from Hitler and Herrmann Goering to sell "degenerate art" (entartete Kunst) for foreign currency. Hildebrand Gurlitt, Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Moeller and Bernhard Boehmer set up shop in Schloss Niederschonhausen, just outside Berlin, to sell the near-16,000 cache of paintings and sculptures which Hitler and Goering removed from the walls of German museums in 1937-38. They were first put on display in the Haus der Kunst in Munich on 19 July 1937, with the Nazi leaders inviting public mockery by two million visitors. Propagandist Joseph Goebbels in a radio broadcast called Germany's degenerate artists "garbage". Hitler opened the Haus der Kunst exhibition with a speech, at the end of which saliva fell out of his mouth in rage. In it he described German art as suffering "a great and fatal illness". Hildebrand Gurlitt and his colleagues did not have much success with their sales, mainly because art labelled "rubbish" had small appeal. So on 20 March 1939 they set fire to 1,004 paintings and sculptures and 3,825 watercolours, drawings and prints in the courtyard of the Berlin Fire Department. The propaganda act raised the attention they hoped. The Basel Museum in Switzerland arrived with 50,000 Swiss francs to spend. Shocked art lovers came to buy. What is unknown after these sales is how many paintings were kept by Gurlitt, Buchholz, Moeller and Boehmer and sold by them to Switzerland and America - ships crossed the Atlantic from Lisbon - for personal gain. Gurlitt was arrested by the Allies near Bamberg in 1945, hiding in the castle of Baron von Pollnitz. He turned down an offer from the baron to hide his art collection in a new secret place. Or so he let a writer know. What we now know is that he did successfully hide more than 1,000 paintings - or his teenage son did. It is possible they were cached in France. Gurlitt's chief job on the Confiscation Committee was to work in Paris during the war, where he lived from 1941 to 1945 in the Hotel de Jersey. He had two ways of collecting for Hitler's Fuehrermuseum. One was to visit abandoned Jewish homes and remove their artworks; his licence was a Nazi law declaring that French nationals who had fled had lost French citizenship. The other was to spend Reichsmarks at the Drouot auction house in Paris, where distress sales were big business. Gurlitt was no small buyer. He paid more than one million French francs for the four most expensive paintings in the highest-value Paris sale of the war - the Georges Viau Impressionists auctioned by Etienne Ader between 11 and 14 December 1942, which fetched £922,000 in wartime values. The sale's top price of 5m francs was paid by Gurlitt for Cezanne's Vallee de l'Arc et Mont Sainte Victoire. It demonstrated Nazi purchasing power. Unfortunately the tiny painting, for which Gurlitt gave 94 times the then record for a Cezanne, proved to be a fake. So what was stored in his son's Munich flat? It is highly likely that pictures acquired in France are foremost and it is French families who will emerge to make claims for them. But there must also be German museum confiscations of Picasso and Matisse and paintings taken from Jewish owners in both Germany and Austria. Gurlitt would have intimately known their value. The top price for Matisse reached £2,600 at auction in 1941, that for Picasso was £880 (paid for a Blue Period Blind Man by the Toledo Museum in Ohio). Gurlitt did not set fire to these nor hand them over. He kept them for himself. Art is the last unfinished business of World War Two. Though the Allies uncovered large numbers of stolen paintings in 1945 in the Alt Aussee salt mines near Salzburg, and in a castle south of Munich, an unknown number have been lost forever. Russia holds more than 120,000 wartime art objects in three museums round Moscow. In many cases, the quality of vanished art was the highest. An important Raphael - Portrait of A Young Man - taken from Catholic owners in Poland heads a list of missing art which amounts to a small National Gallery: paintings by Rubens, Van Dyck and Rembrandt to the fore. Five years ago Austria revealed the existence of more than 10,000 paintings and sculptures, hidden since 1945 in monasteries along the Danube and in state institutions. Their Jewish owners had not been traced; how hard the Austrian government had tried to trace them was not made clear. An Austrian list exists on the internet for descendants of the original owners to come forward - if, that is, they can prove the ownership of Jews in concentration camps, or who fled in panic without documents or photographs as Nazi forces approached. London dealers close to the "restitution" business predict that 100 to 150 paintings will come off the walls of German museums in the next 25 years and be restored to the families of their original owners. As paintings washed around Europe in the 1950s without clear ownership, German museums whose collections of the 20th Century had been wiped out by Hitler bought what they could, at cheap prices, without asking too many questions. The past now catches up with the present. Lawyers in Vienna and Berlin now offer "no win no fee" deals to the descendants of concentration camp victims. The Nazis and their art collecting will continue to make headlines. </body>

      <description>The festival showcasing artists with dyslexia</description>

      <body>Dyspla is an arts festival that showcases the talent of people with dyslexia. This year they're going back to basics. All flyers for the November event openly and happily admit that they "may contain spelling mistakes". A particularly intriguing feature this year is an exhibition of handwriting to celebrate the unique way in which people with the condition put pen to paper. Many with dyslexia avoid handwriting, instead preferring to use computers with software which obliterates typical dyslexia errors. Lennie Varvarides runs the festival and has dyslexia herself. She is a playwright, producer and talent manager based in London. The weeklong event has been an annual fixture in the city since November 2007 but this is the first year it has received funding from the Arts Council. Dyspla goes beyond just one week, though. An offshoot, Sunday Surgery, is a monthly development workshop for dyslexic writers run by Varvarides. Throughout the year, playwrights are coached on how to get their ideas onto the stage without the anxiety of having to pen a lengthy script. In an interview with Ouch, Varvarides explains how she came to see her dyslexia as a positive and why she is so passionate about helping other people with the condition to realise their creative potential. How does dyslexia affect your life? I process information differently. Figuring out the best order to do something in, is sometimes not as obvious to me. When I wake up in the morning, I can't work out what to do first. Should I get my clothes and then go to the bathroom or should I go to the bathroom first and then go back to my bedroom and get dressed? I became self-employed because dyslexia made it really hard to be in a workplace. My managers made comments on my handwriting and didn't think how I organised my day was very practical. They said: "I want you to put in your calendar what you will be doing at nine o'clock, 10 o'clock." It was really difficult for me to plan out my day like that. Why did you start Dyspla? When I finished my Master's in writing for performance I thought, what can I produce that's unique? The only thing different about me was that I love writing and I'm dyslexic. Then I realised that that's quite huge. It's exciting to think about people becoming poets and playwrights when historically they've been told they aren't good at reading and writing. What is The Letters Project? It is our way of engaging with as many dyslexic writers from around the world as we can, without much funding. All we ask is that they handwrite a letter about their experiences of dyslexia or if that's too personal, pen a poem or short story. We accepted anything that was written by a dyslexic, without the use of a computer. All the entries are exhibited at the theatre and will be put on our website. Why do you want to exhibit handwritten material rather than word processed work? Because we want to celebrate our dyslexia, not hide it behind a perfect piece of text that can be produced on a computer using spellcheck and specialist software. You can't hide it if you write something by hand, because the result is wild and robust and heavy. The marks that you make when you are dyslexic, the relationship you have with that pen and that piece of paper, its individual, and it is obvious that there's a learning difficulty there. What is your own handwriting like? It is very squiggly. Another thing about dyslexia is that with our handwriting, the text will begin in one way and towards the end of the page, it changes. The dyslexia stereotype is someone who can't spell. Is that you? My spelling and grammar are awful. I miss out words and I write the wrong words. There's no punctuation. But you can still get the story. Kids are tortured in school for their bad handwriting or their bad spelling or not being able to learn punctuation and grammar properly. But you don't need all of these things to tell a story. The debate due to take place on the festival's opening night is titled dyslexia, help or hindrance. Which do you think it is? I am biased. I do think it is a help, that's why I'm so passionate about the festival. But I didn't know that until I became self-employed and started doing things around dyslexia. Until a few years ago, I hated myself for not being able to get along in the workplace, for having to struggle at school. I was getting frustrated because simple things were just impossible sometimes. The Dyspla festival has made a difference to so many people these last three years. I get emails saying: "I'm so glad you're running this festival. I've never told people that I'm dyslexic and now I feel almost proud." Stories like that make me realise that we are changing how people feel about themselves. Many are now calling dyslexia a positive gift, a sign of creativity. Is it? The two tales that go around when you talk about dyslexia are that art colleges are full of dyslexics and that prisons are full of dyslexics. There's a big difference between the kids that end up in prison and the kids that end up in art college but they share something. So it makes you think that if circumstances were different, then maybe more dyslexics who are low achievers because of their circumstances, could be playwrights and poets. There's a big divide between the dyslexics who get on and the dyslexics who don't and I believe that's all about opportunity. If a dyslexic comes from a really low-income household where their parents don't see any opportunities for themselves, let alone their kids, then dyslexia isn't going to be seen as this amazing wonderful thing. It'll be seen as another reason why that child will fail. Dyspla 2013 takes place from 11 to 17 November, at The Camden People's Theatre.

      <title>Academy chains 'should face Ofsted'</title>
      <description>A report from the Education Select Committee says Ofsted should be given powers to inspect sponsors of groups of academies.</description>

      <body>Ofsted should be given powers to inspect organisations that run chains of academies, says a report from a cross-party committee of MPs. The Education Select Committee wants to improve the way groups of schools work together in partnerships. More than half of secondary schools in England are now academies, operating outside local authority control. Graham Stuart, committee chairman, said schools needed clearer incentives to "look beyond their own school gate". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has previously said he believes that sponsors of such academy chains should face inspections. A Department for Education spokesman said: "Ofsted already inspects all school and academy performance, while the Department for Education examines the performance of chains. "Where academies are underperforming, we take action - this can involve issuing a pre-warning notice and ultimately changing the sponsor if there is no improvement." The report by MPs has examined partnerships and co-operation between schools, against a background of greater school autonomy and different levels of accountability. Mr Stuart says his committee supports giving schools "more freedom to innovate" but there also needs to be a "degree of co-ordination". "Otherwise there is a danger that many schools will operate in isolation rather than in co-operation," said Mr Stuart. The report says that while there is widespread support for the idea of raising standards through greater collaboration there is still a lack of incentive for schools to work together. It argues that local authorities have a "critical role" in improving schools and calls on the government to clarify how they can act as brokers between local schools. But with the expansion of academies, it says that academy chains will play an increasingly important part in helping schools to improve. It warns of the need for co-ordination from this "middle tier", between individual schools and central government, particularly in areas where schools are at risk of underperforming. The Education Select Committee MPs say that academy chains should be open to inspection by Ofsted, in the way that local authorities can be inspected. The committee also argues there should be a mechanism to allow outstanding schools to leave academy chains, including without the approval of the organisation running the chain. The MPs also raise concerns that some outstanding academies are not providing support for weaker neighbouring schools and the report calls for closer monitoring. Sir Michael Wilshaw, giving evidence to the committee earlier this year, told MPs that there needed to be a level playing field in the accountability of organisations running groups of schools. "We will be inspecting local authorities and we should inspect academy chains as well, if we identify underperformance," said the Ofsted chief. "I have made that clear to the secretary of state. It is only fair and equitable that we do that. We have not got the same powers at the moment, but I look forward to receiving the powers to do that." Sir Michael told MPs that there was an "ongoing discussion" with the Department for Education, but he thought the principle had been accepted. He also backed the idea that academy chains could be ranked in performance tables in the same way as local authorities. There are now 3,444 academies, representing 53% of secondary schools and 9% of primaries in England. Among these there are 1,600 schools in academy chains, up from fewer than 900 in autumn 2012. "Hundreds of schools are now collaborating on a scale never witnessed before - brilliant heads and teachers are working together, sharing best practice and driving improvement throughout the system, raising standards for their pupils," said a Department for Education spokesman. Labour's schools minister Kevin Brennan said: "Labour has long argued that collaboration between schools is what is needed if we are to deliver a step-change in standards across all schools. In June, we said that all schools would have to demonstrate effective collaboration with weaker schools for them to be rated as outstanding by Ofsted. "This report - by a cross-party group of MPs - is a damning indictment of David Cameron's schools policy that drives competition between schools instead of incentivising partnerships between them." </body>

      <title>'Government risks teacher shortage'</title>

      <body>Lack of detail in the government's figures for its teacher training plans for next year may hide possible teacher shortages, claims a university expert. Figures published last Friday lack crucial details, says James Noble-Rogers of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET). Mr Rogers says he fears such details may reveal key shortages of trainees. The government said it planned to publish a detailed breakdown of the figures "in the next few weeks". Mr Rogers has issued a freedom of information request to the government for the data. He says Friday's figures failed to give details of how the government has allocated numbers by subject or of how many trainee places have been allocated for secondary or primary education. "This information has been published as a matter of course in the past", he writes in a letter to the schools minister, David Laws. "It should not be necessary in an open democracy for UCET or anyone else to resort to legislation to obtain information of this kind." Last week's figures revealed how many teachers the government plans to train next year. They also showed a further switch in funding for teacher training from universities to the School Direct scheme which allows teachers to learn largely on the job in schools, but with theoretical and specialist training provided by universities. The figures showed that 41,100 teachers would be trained in the year starting September 2014, rising from 38,900 this year. Of these the numbers trained by Schools Direct will rise from 9,600 in the current academic year to 15,400 in 2014. The numbers trained on postgraduate university courses will fall from 20,000 this year to 16,200 next year. Overall, Mr Rogers says this represents a rise in the numbers trained by School Direct from 25% to 37%. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that detailed allocations, including a breakdown by subject, would be published within the next few weeks "once they have been confirmed by universities and schools. "School Direct has built on many excellent long-standing relationships between schools and universities. "We want these relationships to continue to give applicants plenty of choice about their preferred route into teaching. "Higher education institutions are involved in seven in 10 School Direct places "We hit 95% of our recruitment target this year." The spokeswoman added that three candidates applied for every School Direct place last year, and that requests from schools for School Direct places had "shot up from 9,600 to 17,700 in the past year". Mr Rogers told BBC News said the broken down data was usually issued at the same time as the overall figures. He said the delay this year would make it difficult for training providers, particularly universities, to plan. "The only apparent reason it should now be kept secret is to prevent a timely and legitimate analysis of data before allocations are finalised", says the letter to Mr Laws. In August, analysis of School Direct recruitment figures by Prof John Howson of Oxford Brookes University suggested a possible shortfall in the numbers of science and maths specialists. Prof Howson said that three-quarters of the trainee physics teacher places for September were still unfilled. </body>

      <title>Two-year-olds 'should start school'</title>
      <description>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested.</description>

      <body>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged families should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested. Many children from poor backgrounds have a "dire" start to their education, according to Baroness Sally Morgan. They can be up to a year and a half behind their better-off classmates by the age of five, she said. The Pre-School Learning Alliance described Lady Morgan's suggestion as "beyond belief". "Who would disagree with Sally Morgan that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need considerably more support. However, to suggest that placing two and three-year-olds in schools is the answer is beyond belief. "Social inequality needs to addressed in many ways and taking very young children away from their parents and placing them in formal schooling is not the answer," said Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch. Mr Leitch added that international research put the UK's specialist early years network of childminders and nurseries among the world's best. "I am struggling to understand why anyone would promote pushing our youngest, most vulnerable children into schools rather than using the existing network of specialist local provision offered by childminders and group settings," he said. The government said it was making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two. Speaking at an event organised by an academy chain, Lady Morgan argued that poor parenting, poor diet and poor housing meant disadvantaged children were often not ready to start formal schooling at five. She called for a "big brave move" in early years education, with more nurseries attached to schools and a particular focus on the poorest children. She said more schools should become "all through", taking pupils from age three or younger to age 18. Her comments echo a recent Ofsted report which suggested that poor five-year-olds are 19 months behind their more affluent peers. "What a dire start to their educational life," said Lady Morgan. "Those children had low level social skills especially reading and communication. "They're not ready to learn at school. Weak parenting, low educational attainment of parents, poor diet, poor housing and so on. "The gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group. "No-one has yet got a grip on this problem", she said. "I think there needs to be a big brave move on the under-fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly, I think, to look to strong providers to go further down the system. We've increasingly got five-to-18 schools, why not three-to-18?" A Department for Education spokeswoman responded: "We know that teacher-led early years education has a positive impact on children, especially on those from low income backgrounds. "That is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with Ofsted when doing so, and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two-year-olds." The spokeswoman said government reforms would ensure all children, regardless of background, get a good start in life with all three- and four-year-olds entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. Educational Psychologist Dr Jo van Herwegen of Kingston University said formal learning risked damaging children's development if started too early. "It's really all about what you define as being 'school' education and the government needs to understand that children learn through play at this young age. "Formal learning is extremely difficult as children's working memory and language abilities are still developing, "Forcing children to learn in formal settings and sit tests regularly can risk creating performance anxiety and an aversion to learning later on in life". Wendy Ellyat of the Save Childhood Movement said the key was to "prioritise child-flourishing and well-being over educational attainment", whether children were with childminders or in schools or nurseries. "We also need to look at how best to support parents as the most important thing for such young children is to have stable, loving and supportive home lives." </body>

      <description>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates.</description>

      <body>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates. The University of Leicester says they will be available to students based in the UK or EU starting degree courses in 2014 and will last up to 12 weeks each. The aim is to give students insight into what employers want from recruits and to compete in a global jobs market. "Crucially we want our students to be able to adapt to the challenges they face when they leave", said career development manager Raj Patel. The university says the scheme will be the first of its kind offered by any top-20 higher education institution in the UK. All the internships will pay the equivalent of £12,000 to £16,000 a year pro rata, says the university. Some will be within the university's own departments, others will be in the private sector. Bob Athwal, director of career development, said a growing number of employers were using student internships "to feed their talent pipeline". The new scheme will involve an application and selection process, with a programme of workshops to help students prepare. The university has promised the interview process will provide "every campus-based home or EU student with an opportunity during their degree". Mr Athwal says this idea is to showcase "a rich pool of talent" among Leicester undergraduates. The graduate jobs market has been tight in recent years. Figures produced by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) in July this year forecast a 4% fall in graduate vacancies, with leading UK employers reporting an average of 85 applications for each job. A separate survey of more than 18,000 university leavers, published in June, suggested graduates who had had internships were three times more likely to get jobs. The study by High Fliers research found that more than one in three students had completed work experience or internships with a prospective employer. </body>

      <title>Forced academies 'costing too much'</title>
      <description>An internal document leaked to the BBC suggests ministers are prepared to force schools to become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits.</description>

      <body>Ministers are making struggling schools become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits, a leaked government document suggests. Civil servants planning for budget cuts at the education department suggested ministers consider value for money before forcing academy conversions. But Education Secretary Michael Gove overruled this cash-saving idea as "totally wrong", the document reveals. The education department says academies are the best way of improving schools. But the National Union of Teachers said Mr Gove's "pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost". Academies are privately run schools funded by the state in England. They have control over their own admissions, and increased freedoms over what they teach and pay staff. They can get up to £110,000 in start-up costs. Where underperforming schools are unwilling to convert to academy status, it is enforced in several steps - including sacking the governors and replacing them with a hand-picked interim governing body. Ultimately the secretary of state can issue an academy order requiring a change in the school's management. The Department for Education (DfE) sees the academies programme as its key engine of school improvement, but critics have described the process as heavy-handed and undemocratic. The DfE plans to cut its administrative budget by £290m by 2015-16. The document, entitled What Stops at the DfE, looks at where savings could be made. It says forced conversions are "very resource intensive" and reveals that the government's underperformance strategy is in need of extra funds. But despite tight department budgets, it is clear that conversions where the costs outweigh the benefits - often where there is strong opposition to a change - are still being pushed through. The document suggests more account should be taken of a "cost-benefit analysis" in "determining the approach to academisation of underperforming schools". But it stresses that the secretary of state does not want to see such value-for-money checks on the programme and that the changes have not been made. It adds that ministers had expected to see some schools or heads change their mind about becoming academies as a result of high profile cases such as that of Downhills Primary School, which it cites as an example. Mr Gove ordered the Haringey school be taken over by an academy chain, despite 94% of parents opposing the move, and claims that it was already on a trajectory of improvement when the conversion was being proposed. Legal action was threatened as a result and teachers walked out on strike. But the document says: "Achieving success in difficult areas has a bigger potential pay-off and is important for the reputation and reach of the overall programme but both this and forced conversions are very resource intensive." And it warns: "If we limit the number of forced interventions there is a risk that we don't tackle the worst performing schools (which would not otherwise become academies)." It is also clear that the DfE is seeking extra cash to ensure the forced academies programme is maintained. It talks about "securing the additional resource needed for the underperformance strategy" and says it will not place "any arbitrary limits on forced conversion activity". And indeed the document is peppered with references to how money can be transferred from the oversight of maintained schools so that the "increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time work on a new admissions code, which the document says might prove inevitable because of various pressures, has been axed. And oversight of boarding schools and home education is being downgraded despite civil servant warnings that there could be child protection risks as a result. A DfE spokesman said: "Ministers are clear we will not stand by when a school is failing its pupils, and that the strong support of a proven sponsor is the best way to see rapid and sustainable improvements. "While it is vital that government constantly considers ways to cut bureaucracy and save public money, we make no apology for prioritising improving the education of children in the country's worst performing schools." National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower said: "Despite civil servants identifying the forced academy programme as an activity that could be cut back in order to address the disproportionate cost to the public purse, this document makes clear that ideology won out over sound public policy decision making. "It is increasingly evident that Michael Gove's pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost. "At a time when school budgets elsewhere are being cut is really quite an inappropriate use of public finances." David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said: "In many cases, giving more flexibility to local areas to take swift action, for instance by recruiting new governors and staff, would be a better and more cost effective way of improving standards. "Councils want to be able to intervene more quickly and effectively in poorly performing schools but are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. "Money spent on conversion costs could be saved by enabling earlier intervention by councils who are focused on school performance rather than management structures." </body>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <title>London online course draws 200,000</title>
      <description>The first annual figures from a UK online course show a high initial take-up, but also a high dropout rate.</description>

      <body>More than 200,000 students signed up for the first wave of online courses offered by the University of London's International Programmes. The university has published details of the take-up of four online courses - so-called Moocs - in their first year. This also showed the high dropout rate with only about 9,000 students completing a course. Mike Kerrison, director of academic development, said the the experiment so far had been "very successful". The University of London's International Programmes specialises in providing degrees by distance learning and has been providing such courses since the 19th Century. Last year it became one of the UK's early adopters of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses - which deliver university courses through the internet. It offered free courses through the US-based Coursera network, which now has more than five million registrations. This snapshot from the University of London's International Programmes at the end of the first year shows the scale of interest in such online courses, with 210,000 students signing up. Reflecting the demand for higher education, this is about four times the total number of conventional students studying with the University of London's International Programmes. Among those people who signed up, 90,000 were categorised as "active students" who participated in one of the four pilot courses, which were about computer programming, law, malicious software and the use of photography. The university says there was a strong sense of value from students, with 91% rating their experience as good, very good or excellent. These online courses, with no formal entry requirements, have a high dropout rate, and in this case there were 8,843 students who received a "Statement of Accomplishment" for successful completion, fewer than one in 20 of those who initially signed up. "Considering that the courses are free and allow students to do as much or as little work as they like, the number of students engaging in the course materials is considerable," said Mr Kerrison. There has been particular interest in online universities in the US, where prestigious institutions such as Harvard, MIT and Stanford have been at the forefront of creating online platforms such as Coursera and edX. These have also spread into international networks with major recent partnerships in China and France. The online model has also begun to be refined, with Harvard developing courses for a much smaller, pre-selected group of online students, with the aim of much higher completion rates. These have been dubbed Spocs, small private online courses. This autumn also saw the launch of a UK online university partnership, Futurelearn, which has announced new courses starting in January, bringing to 29 the total number of courses available. This includes Shakespeare's Hamlet: text, performance and culture, from the University of Birmingham and Exploring our oceans, from the University of Southampton. So far Futurelearn has attracted students from 190 countries with five of the pilot courses already reaching their planned quotas. Chief executive Simon Nelson said the response in this first term had "exceeded all our expectations". </body>

      <title>Engineering gap 'constrains' economy</title>
      <description>The UK's economic recovery could be constrained by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser.</description>

      <body>The UK's economic recovery could be "constrained" by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser. Prof John Perkins, chief scientific adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has identified "a substantial demand for engineers". He has issued "a call to action" to government, industry and educators to "step up" to inspire future engineering talent and address skills shortages. Business Secretary Vince Cable said too few teenagers were studying science. "Engineers must have a strong foundation in maths and science, especially physics. "The number of young people choosing these subjects post-16 is relatively low, especially amongst women," said Mr Cable. In his Review of Engineering Skills, Prof Perkins says the UK already relies on "inward migration" to fill skilled jobs in key sectors such as oil and gas extraction, aerospace, and computer, electronic and optical engineering. "This should not be our long-term solution. "We should support the UK's young people by preparing them to compete for highly paid, skilled engineering jobs, improving their career prospects and reducing the need to import engineering skills," says the review. It calls for "purposeful and effective early intervention to enthuse tomorrow's engineers" and ensure they have the "solid academic foundations to engage in the subject". The report calls for as many young people as possible to study "rigorous curricula in maths and science". In particular it says the UK lags behind its competitors in the number of 16- to 18-year-olds studying maths. Prof Perkins says the profession suffers "from widespread misconceptions and lack of visibility that deter young people, and especially girls from pursuing it as a career". The report refers to polling carried out for the Tomorrow's Engineers Week campaign, which suggests that only half of 11- to 14-year olds would consider a career in engineering. This dropped to 35% among girls and only 24% of parents of girls said they thought engineering was a suitable profession for their daughters. Prof Perkins draws "some comfort that we are heading in the right direction" with initiatives to inspire future engineers, a focus on maths and science in schools, more apprenticeships and "our continued strength in higher education". His 22 recommendations urge both short and long term action to "get the right messages to young people" - particularly girls, to ensure vocational training is high quality and high status and that "higher education continues to deliver". The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it was making available nearly £49m to boost engineering skills. From January some £30m of this money will allow employers to bid for match-funding for training schemes to address specific engineering skills shortages. Another £18m will fund an elite training facility in Coventry, while Tomorrow's Engineers will get £250,000 to encourage schoolchildren into engineering. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, which represents almost 6,000 companies, said: "The report rightly shines the spotlight on the need for a pipeline of talented future engineers, with credible recommendations on how this can be achieved. "Whilst this is a long-term task, the message from employers is clear - we are ready to take on the challenge." Anne Spackman of the charity Career Academies which runs internship schemes to prepare schoolchildren for employment said efforts to "grow the number of potential recruits" into engineering were crucial. "Engineering is an area rich in job opportunities but lacking the skilled workers to fill them," said Ms Spackman. </body>

      <title>Not reporting abuse 'must be crime'</title>
      <description>Teachers and other professionals who fail to report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the former director of public prosecutions says.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24772777</url>

      <body>Teachers and other professionals who do not report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the ex-director of public prosecutions says. Keir Starmer said under a British "mandatory reporting" law, those who failed to act could be sent to jail. Declassified files uncovered by BBC Panorama show how schools have repeatedly failed to protect children from sex offenders. But the government said mandatory reporting was not the answer. While statutory guidance has been issued previously urging professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report child abuse, failure to do so is not a crime in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1967 makes it an offence to fail to disclose an arrestable offence - including those against children - to police. Mr Starmer, who was succeeded as director of public prosecutions by Alison Saunders on Friday, said it was time to "plug a gap in the law" that had been there for a "very, very long time". "If you're in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, and you have cause to believe that a child has been abused, or is about to be abused, you really ought to do something about it," he said. He said a criminal penalty would "focus people's minds" and said there should be "immunity for individuals if they did report". He said the penalty for failing to report abuse could be a short jail sentence or a fine. "There are just too many examples of cases where those who have suspected abuse have not really done anything about it and the perpetrator has either got away with it or, worse still, been able to perpetuate the offending." He added: "I would have a reasonably broad category of individuals that were subject to the law. "Obviously school teachers, but others in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, including other educational institutions, even sporting institutions." Similar laws are already in places in countries including the US, Canada and Australia. For the first time, the Catholic Church and the Church of England have also come out in support of mandatory reporting. Bishop Paul Butler, head of safeguarding at the Church of England, said: "We have to think of the child first, not ourselves, not the institution, what's best for the child." But the government has no plans to change the law. The Department for Education said professionals "should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child". "This happens every year in many thousands of cases and numbers of referrals have increased over recent years," it added. "Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children." And Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the Action for Children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are not convinced that making it mandatory will do what we need it to do." She said the reporting of child abuse in the UK was on the rise and that a "huge issue" was that "teachers and people across the system are not sufficiently trained to see those early signs of abuse". It was important they knew how to spot those signs "and not to feel that they may be prosecuted if they don't", she added. But Jonathan West, of the Mandate Now coalition of charities, welcomed Mr Starmer's call, adding that "social services can't actually act on cases they haven't been told about". He added: "Schools, other organisations, often don't really want to have a child abuse scandal on their hands. "It is surprisingly common that schools want to handle such things in house." Ever since the Jimmy Savile revelations, Panorama has been investigating secret historical records and looking at what government officials knew about abuse in children's homes and boarding schools. Declassified government files going back 60 years show how senior civil servants were well aware that school authorities routinely hid child abuse - preferring instead to protect the reputation of their own institutions - and the law was an inadequate deterrent. One of the most detailed historical files in the National Archives is about a cover-up at the Royal Alexandra and Albert school. Today it is a well-regarded state boarding school in Reigate, Surrey. However, research by Panorama has revealed that seven child abusers worked at the school between the 1950s and the 1980s.

      <title>GCSE overhaul in England made final</title>
      <description>Exams regulator Ofqual confirms it is making changes to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation.</description>

      <body>Exams regulator Ofqual has confirmed the changes it is making to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. A new grading system will use numbers instead of letters, and coursework is being scrapped for most subjects. The changes will be in stages, starting with pupils due to take GCSE exams in 2017. Those who turn 13 in this academic year will be the first. English and maths will be the first subjects affected. Pupils will begin studying the new courses in English language, English literature and maths from the autumn of 2015. And about 20 other popular GCSE subjects will be revamped in the same way, ready for teaching a year later, in 2016, with the first exams for those taken in 2018. The changes apply to England only. Wales is planning its own GCSE shake-up, but Northern Ireland is not planning any changes. Scotland has its own exams system. While they come in, pupils in England will have some exams graded with numbers and some with letters, leading teaching unions to warn this will be confusing for pupils, parents and employers. Exams will be graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest. Pupils who fail will be awarded a "U" for an unclassified result. All exams will be taken after two years of study, rather than in modules taken at various stages over two years, meaning a return to the format of O-levels, which pre-dated GCSEs. And there will be more marks awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar. The head of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said the changes were "fundamental". "This is the biggest change in a generation," she said. "They [GCSEs] have been around for over 25 years but now we are seeing fresh content, a different structure, high-quality assessment coming in. "It's a significant change for students and for schools." Ms Stacey said the move to a numerical system meant a new grade was being added and that would help examiners distinguish between candidates' performance - especially at the top grades. She suggested that the move away from traditional grades might be hard for some people to understand, but was important. "The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly," she said. At the same time, the government is confirming changes to what has to be studied in English language, English literature and maths, because the overhaul of exams covers both what is studied and how it is assessed. It says in English literature, students will have to "study whole texts in detail, covering a range of literature including Shakespeare, 19th Century novels, Romantic poetry and other high-quality fiction and drama". The new maths exam will cover more topics and will be more challenging, the government says. Details were released on Friday morning. For maths, Ofqual is keeping the present arrangement where pupils can be entered for either a higher- or lower-tier paper in maths, depending on their ability. But in English, that division has been scrapped and one exam will be taken by all. At the moment, students who are entered for easier papers can be awarded only the maximum of a C grade. The government says young people were let down by the old exam system; that frequent testing meant not enough time was spent on "deep learning" and not enough attention was paid to grammar, spelling and punctuation. Schools Minister Elizabeth Truss says the changes will improve students' "core skills" in maths and English and raise expectations. "What we want to do is encourage schools to focus on those core skills that employers really want, because that is what is going to help our children get jobs when they leave school," she said. Headteachers' representative, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), gave what it said was a "cautious welcome" to the changes. Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said: "There is much to welcome in today's announcement, especially the measured approach Ofqual has taken to this significant task. "We have always agreed that GCSE can be improved to better prepare students to meet the needs of the world we live in today. But the constant tinkering with GCSEs we have had in the past has not been helpful." Unions representing classroom teachers warned that a shift away from coursework and having different levels of exams for different abilities could damage some pupils' education. Secondary school teacher and spokesman for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Jovan Trkulja, said that less able students could suffer. "Exams are challenging and they should continue to be challenging. But we have to remember that setting the top of the mountain as the baseline means someone has to fall behind, and I feel for the sense of failure for the less able," he said. Shadow schools minister, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, said he had "reservations" about some aspects of the changes and that the move towards a numbered grading system was a step back to the 1970s. He said he agreed that the pendulum "might have swung a little too far on coursework", but there was now a danger that "it will swing too far the other way". "Having everything staked on one final exam is not great for all pupils," he said. </body>

      <title>Council tracks school-run on CCTV</title>
      <description>A London council is thought to be the first local authority to confirm it uses CCTV cameras to spot illegal school run parking.</description>

      <body>A north London council has confirmed it is using CCTV cameras to target parents who park illegally on the school run. Enfield Council has set up cameras outside schools that record number plates of cars parked illegally for more than three seconds. The system's manufacturers say other boroughs are also trialling the system, but did not confirm which ones. Local authorities say the cameras will improve safety but opponents say it is just a way of raising money. The data is recorded and reported back to councils and either a warning letter can be issued or a penalty fine. Paul Pearson, of parking campaign group Penalty Charge Notice, said there was not enough places for parents to park. Alex Henney, the general secretary of the National Motorists' Action Group, said a civil enforcement officer should be used instead of the cameras. "It seems to me that probably there's an agenda to generate money - that is illegal," he said. "In my view, the sensible approach is to get the council and school head together to discuss it with the parents to sort out some arrangement." However, Amanda Philips, the head teacher at Old Ford Primary School in Tower Hamlets, east London, said the school had tried to address parking issues by communicating with families, the local council and the police but there is a problem. "It is as always a very small number of families with particular cars that we can identify that we constantly have conversations with," she said. Dave Richmond, the joint director of camera manufacturers Videalert, said he did not believe it would be a "cash cow" as once several tickets were issued, drivers would stop parking illegally. He said the problem with using civil enforcement officers is that drivers comply with the rules when an officer is present, but revert back to their normal behaviour when they have gone. "If you watch the videos that I have seen, some of the behaviour of drivers outside schools is like the Rocky Horror Show," Mr Richmond said. "It is really bad and therefore this is a safety issue and it needs to be dealt with." In a statement, Enfield Council said it was "committed to improving road safety for all pedestrians, especially children walking to and from school, and reducing road safety related casualties. "This is a pilot project and we will evaluate its success before making any decisions on future use," it said. </body>

      <title>'Raise tuition fees with inflation'</title>
      <description>University tuition fees should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged.</description>

      <body>University tuition fees in England should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged. Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey and president of Universities UK, says a £9,000 fee cap is "not sustainable". "The whole issue is that fees can't remain frozen for ever", he told Times Higher Education magazine. The National Union of Students (NUS) said last year's trebling in fees had already far outpaced rising costs. Sir Christopher's comments follow a recent call from the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Andrew Hamilton, for undergraduate fees to be "more closely related to the true cost" of a degree at Oxford, £16,000. Last month Prof Hamilton said the funding shortfall meant Oxford faced an annual funding gap of £70m. Sir Christopher said that Surrey had "several subjects where we are losing substantial sums of money teaching UK and EU students". He said these included science, technology and engineering courses. Sir Christopher added: "On aggregate the £9,000 was perhaps a reasonable starting point, but it really needs to have a sensible indexing linked to it." He said that the £9,000 maximum fees paid by students would be worth only around £8,250 by 2016 when inflation was factored in. However, Sir Christopher told the magazine that he was not an advocate of a major jump in fees: "I don't think that £16,000 is a likely scenario in the near future." Universities UK will publish a report next week on the future of university financing. This is expected to look at how universities will fund a predicted 26% rise in demand for university places within the next 20 years. Universities Minister David Willetts has said a rising birthrate will mean the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000. The paper is expected to explore where universities will find the capital to expand their facilities and accommodation. Universities UK points out that the rise in tuition fees paid by students was accompanied by a corresponding cut in the level of government funding for universities. The NUS said suggestions that undergraduates should pay more were unlikely to win sympathy from students or their parents. Union president Toni Pearce said: "What seems to have been missed here is the inflation-busting increases on the upper limit on tuition fees just last year, when the cap was nearly tripled to an eye-watering £9,000. "We've already seen a huge shift onto the shoulders of individuals through higher fees that far outpace rising costs. "Students and their families are facing a huge financial squeeze. The value of both earnings and student financial support is falling in real terms and the cost of making ends meet is increasing by the day." The government said its reforms had put the higher education sector on a more sustainable footing. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We believe the £9,000 fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching, with many institutions now planning to invest more in improved teaching facilities for students. "We want to ensure that going to university remains affordable for students and it is based on their ability, not their ability to pay." </body>

      <body>The University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) has received what it says is one of the biggest ever donations to a UK university. The £20m gift - worth more than a quarter of its annual turnover - would be "transformational", SOAS said. It came from the Alphawood Foundation in Chicago, set up by Fred Eychaner, a former Asian art student at SOAS. The money will pay for building upgrades, research and scholarships. Prof Paul Webley, director of SOAS, said the university was "thrilled" to be working with Alphawood. "SOAS has been studying and interpreting the development, languages, arts and cultures of Asia for nearly 100 years and this project will draw on that knowledge as well as further reinforce our position as a world-leading centre for the study and interpretation of South East Asian art." The donation includes £5m towards building development and £15m to be spent on research into South East Asian Art as well as improving links with the region. SOAS said the money would be used to bring post-graduate students from the south-east Asia to London. It also wants to establish three new academic posts, including professorships in Buddhist and Hindu art, and develop links with like-minded institutions in countries such as Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. Mr Eychaner, a broadcasting tycoon who owns a string of radio stations, said he wanted his money to build bridges, especially in areas of Asia held back in the 20th Century by war and politics. "Alphawood Foundation seeks to stimulate and expand the study of South East Asian art at all levels - from an educated and interested public to museum professionals to new PhD-level scholars. "We chose to advance this goal by making our largest gift to date to SOAS because this school creates a very special learning and research environment where West meets East." Mr Eychaner - who owned a television station until he sold it to Rupert Murdoch's Fox network - studied for a post-graduate diploma at SOAS, which currently has more than 5,000 students from 130 countries. </body>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Home Office of "sabotage" after visas were denied for two Chinese teachers returning to work in Scotland through a partnership programme. Mr Salmond, who is currently on a visit to China, has lodged a protest. He said the move amounted to sabotage of Scottish government efforts to build cultural links. The Home Office said it was looking into the matter which was being taken seriously. The teaching programme is run by the Confucius Institute, backed by Strathclyde University and the Scottish government. It involves teachers from China offering Scottish pupils the chance to acquire skills in Mandarin and Chinese culture. Five teachers from Tian Jin municipality were due to return to Scotland for a second year, but two of them have been told their visas will not be renewed. Mr Salmond has written to UK Home Secretary Theresa May voicing his shock and dismay and warned that the episode risks damaging Scotland's relationship with China. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said: "It is an absolutely extraordinary situation you couldn't make it up. It is deeply offensive to the Chinese and it is a decision that needs to be reversed as soon as possible. "This amounts to sabotage of a programme that everyone thinks absolutely fantastic and doing great work in Scotland. "The importance of this is quite fundamental. Our argument is to have a successful economic relationship with China you must have it underpinned by a successful cultural relationship, that is the view of the Chinese, that is the view of the Scottish government. "If you undermine one you undermine the other." A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We have received the letter from the Scottish government and we have been in contact with them over these cases. "We are taking this matter seriously and will be looking into the decisions." </body>

      <title>How technology best boosts learning</title>

      <body>An inner city primary is at the heart of a project to test how technology can be used to boost children's learning. Rosendale Primary, in south London, won a £253,000 grant for the research which will involve 1,400 pupils in 24 schools in London, Essex and Manchester. Rosendale pupils use tablet computers to photograph their work and tag it with notes about how well they learned. The Lambeth school's head teacher, Kate Atkins, says the aim is to help pupils develop a range of learning strategies. "Poor learners are often over-confident about the power of their memories and can struggle to find alternative strategies. "We need to encourage them to think about how they learn and to try something else." Children at the school are encouraged to reflect on every piece of work or unit of learning. They are asked to think about which bits went well, what they struggled with and what they might need to do to improve when they next revisit the subject. A key part of this is to ask children how they felt about each piece of work, for example many children find conducting a science experiment exciting and fun but hate having to sit down and write it up afterwards, says Ms Atkins. "An emotional reaction is a key part of the learning process." The research project aims to test whether the strategy actually improves pupils' attainment. It will be tested at 24 two-form-entry schools, one form will carry on as normal, the other will record and reflect on their learning using digital note-taking. Children will be tested at the start and finish of the project to measure their abilities and the results evaluated at Manchester University. The project is one of seven in a £3.5m strategy by the Education Endowment Foundation and Nominet Trust to evaluate the impact of technology in schools . The charities say the aim is to "rigorously test" new ways to use technology to improve attainment, particularly of less advantaged children. The grants will support 18,000 pupils in 260 schools across England. Another project, centred on Shireland Collegiate Academy in Sandwell, West Midlands, will test the effectiveness of a "flipped learning" approach. In effect pupils do their homework before the lesson, watching a video or web presentation on a new concept the night before. The lesson itself then focuses on a more detailed exploration of the concept, perhaps experimentation or discussion, and on helping struggling pupils. Dan Sutch of the Nominet Trust said: "The more we can understand where technology best supports learning and teaching the better." The Education Endowment Foundation said the grants would help identify the most effective ways to use digital technology to improve learning for the most disadvantaged pupils. Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said schools spent huge sums on technology but there was too little evidence of its effectiveness. "The gap in educational outcomes between rich and poor is the biggest barrier to social mobility we face and it is essential to find out if and how technology can be used to help close it." </body>

      <title>Baby P mother 'released from prison'</title>
      <description>The mother of baby Peter Connelly has been released from prison four years after being jailed over his death, it is understood.</description>

      <body>Baby Peter Connelly's mother, who was jailed over his death, has been freed from prison, it is understood. Tracey Connelly was jailed for a minimum of five years in 2009 after admitting causing or allowing her son's death. She had also spent more than a year in custody on remand. The Parole Board recently said it had recommended her release. Peter died in August 2007 with more than 50 injuries, despite being on a social services "at-risk" register. His death at home in Tottenham, north London, came a day after police told his mother she would not be prosecuted over abuse of the 17-month-old. Social workers, health professionals and police officers had visited 60 times in eight months. The Ministry of Justice refused to confirm whether Connelly had been released, saying it did not comment on individual cases. Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012. The Parole Board did not recommend her release then, but a three-strong panel said she should be released following a second review. She admitted causing or allowing Peter's death soon after being charged, and spent more than a year on remand before being sentenced in May 2009. The sentence was "imprisonment for public protection", which carries a minimum term after which prisoners can be considered for release. When deciding whether to release a prisoner, the Parole Board must consider the nature of their crime, their history, their progress in prison, any statements made on their behalf and reports from relevant professionals. Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence she admitted. Barker was given a 12-year sentence for his "major role" in Peter's death. Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term, but later on appeal that was changed to a fixed six-year term. He was freed in August 2011 but has since been recalled to prison. This week the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed Sharon Shoesmith, who was head of children's services at Haringey Council at the time of Peter's death, had agreed a "six-figure payout" for unfair dismissal after the case. </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Asia’s parents suffering 'education fever'</title>
      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>
      <description>The UK's biggest online university project is being launched, with a partnership of more than 20 universities offering free courses.</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <title>Why we're afraid of 'zombie' faces</title>
      <description>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist.</description>

      <body>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist. A research project by the Open University's Stephanie Lay found a particular fear of "near-human" faces. It explains why blank eyes, automatons, masks and ventriloquists' dolls are common cinema devices to instil fear. The psychologist says a study of 3,000 people found widespread "repulsion" at near-human faces. The finding is part of research into the so-called "uncanny valley" phenomenon in how people react to robots. The effect was discovered in the 1970s in research into whether giving robots human features would make them more reassuring to humans working with them or using them in the home. The research found that people were initially more receptive to robots which were made slightly human looking, but if they began to imitate humans too closely, people were repelled. Instead of being reassured, too close a resemblance to a human form was seen as sinister. Mrs Lay's research is examining this "uncanny valley" effect from a psychological perspective. She describes it as "the sense of unease that accompanies the sight of something almost, but not quite, human". It is the sudden plunge in reaction at a point just before a face is fully humanised. For instance the empty eyes of a zombie figure in an otherwise human face is highly disconcerting. And it explains why the faces of dolls, clowns and dummies are used so regularly to frighten audiences. "A consistent finding of the survey was people's reactions to images where the face was convincingly human but with lifeless eyes or where eerily human eyes appeared in a non-human face," says Mrs Lay. "These were perceived to be the most uncanny and disturbing of all the images and explain why characters such as zombies in horror films unsettle people to such great effect." This is particularly the case with psychological horror films, she says, rather than bloodthirsty shockers. She says this uneasy reaction could be caused by the sudden disruption in how the human brain processes human faces. When people begin to interpret something as a human face, they are left with a sense of disquiet when they come against something that does not match their expectations. Being able to "read" another person's eyes is particularly important in this process of interpreting faces, she says. "It may be that our normal processing mechanisms are not being engaged for these faces, causing the unsettling effect when people want to like a near-human face, but realise something is wrong." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>University staff strike over pay</title>
      <description>Lecturers and support staff at many UK universities are staging a walkout over pay.</description>

      <body>Lecturers and support staff at many UK universities are staging a walkout over pay. Unions say there is "strong support for the action" and 149 institutions are affected. But university employers say support for the strike is "not widespread" and disruption has been "minimal". Rallies are planned for many cities over lunchtime as part of joint action between the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. Union members say their pay has failed to keep up with rising living costs and have rejected a 1% pay offer. But university employers say the "vast majority" of staff think the offer is fair. Officials from the UCU say early reports are that some buildings and departments - including many libraries - have been closed. Teaching at Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University has been cancelled and the chemistry department at Loughborough is shut, they say. The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1%, which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2009. They say universities will face the "most widespread disruption for years". UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: "Staff, from porters to professors have walked out this morning in protest at some of the most sustained pay cuts since the Second World War. "Nobody wants to be on strike, but a 13% real-terms pay cut as vice-chancellors' pay continued to increase and universities' surpluses built up simply is not fair." She said the unions had heard of closed departments and buildings and that some universities had cancelled all teaching for the day. "If the employers try to spin the action as having little impact then it merely shows how out of touch they are with what is really happening on the ground at universities." There was a 35% turnout in the UCU strike ballot, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Universities had warned students some classes might be cancelled and that some some facilities could be closed. Helen Fairfoul, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), told BBC News fewer than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote for strike action. "We can see the strike is not widely supported," she said. "The vast majority of staff think this is a fair offer. This is a difficult period. No pay levels in any sector have kept pace with inflation." She added that salary costs in most institutions would actually rise by about 3% this year because some staff would get incremental increases and merit awards as well as the 1% increase. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We are disappointed that the unions have decided in favour of industrial action. Students have the right to expect that their learning will not be disrupted by such action." </body>

      <title>Call to drop term-time holiday ban</title>
      <description>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking term-time holidays, will be delivered to the government on Wednesday.</description>

      <body>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking holidays during term-time will be delivered later. The 126,000-signature document will be given to the Department for Education. Campaigners say many families cannot afford the higher cost of a break during the school holidays. The DfE said it was giving schools more freedom to set term dates - potentially meaning parents could book cheaper holidays. Until last month, heads could grant up to 10 days' leave a year for family holidays in "special circumstances". Since 1 September, head teachers have no longer been able to grant any absence outside school holidays except under "exceptional circumstances". The reference to the 10-day limit has been removed from the regulations. A petition against the ban, started by a parent and hosted on the 38-Degrees Campaigns By You website, had attracted 126,275 signatures by Tuesday evening. The petition says the ban will "adversely affect" families who cannot afford the higher prices charged to holidaymakers during the school holidays. "Also not all businesses can allow their staff to be off all at the same time", says the petition. "All children who have a good attendance record should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy quality time with their parents on an annual holiday of up to 10 days once per year." Craig Langman, the parent who started the petition, told BBC News his six-year-old son still recalls a holiday the family took to Rome during term-time two years ago and has done school projects based on the trip. "It was probably more educational than being in school to be honest. "He still remembers the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum." Mr Langman says the cost of breaks during the school holidays can be three times as much as during term-time. "I am not asking kids to have a guaranteed extra two weeks on top of their existing 10 weeks' holiday each year - but this blanket ban on term-time holidays with the threat of a fine is almost killing families." He argues that the decision as to whether to grant a request for extra days off school should remain with head teachers. "I feel that most MPs in the government had holidays with their parents when they were younger so why do they think they have the power to stop our children's generation from enjoying the same lifestyle," says Mr Langman. "Soon only rich kids would be able to go on holiday and that's unfair on everyone else." A DfE spokesperson said: "If children aren't in school they lose out on valuable learning time and have to waste more time catching up. That's why children shouldn't be taken out of school during term time unless absolutely necessary. "We are giving all schools the freedom to set their own term dates, for example David Young Community Academy in Leeds operates a seven-term year starting in June. This means that parents and teachers can benefit from cheaper holidays at the end of September. "We want schools to consider changes to term dates that will work for their pupils and their families." </body>

      <title>Extra marks for exam illness up 10%</title>
      <description>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because pupils had problems such as a minor illness.</description>

      <body>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because of pupils having problems such as a temporary illness, the highest level on record. The figures from exam regulator Ofqual showed a 10% increase in such cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There were 374,000 requests approved for "special consideration" in marking this summer's GCSEs and A-levels. The most common adjustment was worth 3% of the maximum exam mark. The figures from Ofqual show that there was an even higher level of requests from schools for such special consideration - rising by 13% on the previous year to 415,200. Only about 10% of these requests were rejected. The extra marks are allowed because an exam candidate has faced an unexpected disadvantage, which could range from a minor illness to something more serious, such as a bereavement. The exam regulator describes the criteria as "temporary injury, illness, indisposition or another unforeseen incident immediately before or during the exam's period". It could also allow a student to receive a grade reflecting their ability if they were unable to attend an exam. The maximum adjustment is 5%, such as a close family bereavement. A "minor illness on the day of the exam" could gain a pupil an extra 2%. As well as these adjustments for unexpected problems, Ofqual says that candidates taking a further 209,900 exam papers were given special access arrangements because of a disability or a medical condition. These numbers of special access cases are falling, both in terms of request and approvals. But the most common request remains asking for an extra 25% time for candidates, which was allowed for 107,400 exam papers. Other types of help included using a reading device or someone to act as a scribe, such as for people with problems with their sight. The exam report from Ofqual also shows a sharp year-on-year rise in penalties on staff for "malpractice" in exams, up 62% to 97, although this was lower than in 2011. The most common type of staff malpractice was giving "inappropriate assistance to candidates" and the most common penalty was a written warning. There were also 135 penalties for exam malpractice for schools and colleges, almost all of which were written warnings. Among pupils, there were 2,590 penalties from this summer's exams - similar to last year. The most common form of cheating was using "unauthorised material", which usually meant a mobile phone. But there have been declining numbers caught trying to use mobiles - down for the fourth consecutive year to 814 cases. </body>

      <title>Neets are 'public health time bomb'</title>
      <description>Youth unemployment in the UK is a "public health time bomb waiting to explode", according to a review by the World Health Organisation.</description>

      <body>Youth unemployment in the UK is a "public health time bomb waiting to explode", according to a review by the World Health Organisation. It warned of the health consequences of high numbers of Neets - people not in employment, education or training. More than one million 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK are classed as Neet. The report also said the UK was behind other European countries on female life expectancy, deaths of children under five and child poverty. The WHO and the University College London Institute of Health Equity analysed the reasons for differences in life expectancy across Europe. For the UK, it highlighted the dangers of young people being out of work. Wealth is tightly linked to life expectancy and is one of the major reasons for the north-south health divide in the UK. Being unemployed has immediate health consequences, including an increased risk of depression and suicide. Being out of work in the longer term increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and stroke. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who led the review, said: "Unemployment may be falling in the UK, but persistent high levels of the number of young people over 18 not in employment, education or training is storing up a public health time bomb waiting to explode." The length of the fuse is thought to be 10 to 20 years. The report said women and children in Spain, Italy and Cyprus would fare better than those in the UK. It said life expectancy for women was 83 years in the UK, behind Spain and France at 85 and Germany at 84. The report added that mortality rates in the under-fives were higher than most countries in the west of Europe and even some eastern European nations, including the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Figures also showed that one in four children in the UK live in poverty - a figure higher than other countries such as Iceland, Cyprus and Ireland. Prof Marmot said: "We are failing too many of our children, women and young people on a grand scale. "I would say to any government that cares about the health of its population: look at the impact of their policies on the lives people are able to lead and, more importantly, at the impact on inequality. "Health inequality, arising from social and economic inequalities, is socially unjust, unnecessary and avoidable, and it offends against the human right to health." Prof John Ashton, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: "Michael Marmot is absolutely right that the number of 'Neets' is a public health time bomb. "There is a lot of evidence to show that being out of work is bad your health. "It is disgraceful that a generation of young people are growing up in a world when unemployment is the norm, not the exception." The Department for Work and Pensions said it was "really encouraging" that the numbers of young people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance was falling, but "we're not complacent - we'll continue to do everything possible to give young people the best chance in life". A Government spokesperson said health inequality was taken "very seriously". In a statement they said: "The Chief Medical Officer raised this issue in her recent report on children's health, outlining the need to invest early in our young people to give them good foundations and the best start in life. "We have already successfully protected the poorest from falling behind and last year we saw a reduction of 100,000 children in workless poor families. In addition, we are training an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015, and 16,000 of the most vulnerable families will be helped by family nurses." </body>

      <body>Internet forums and chatrooms can have positive effects that should be more widely acknowledged, experts say. The call comes after Oxford University researchers carried out an analysis of 14 different studies looking at how young people use the internet. The review - published in the Plos One journal - said a number of studies had found a link between internet use and self-harm and suicide. But it said others had found the internet could be a positive influence. The dangers of internet use have received widespread coverage this year. In one case, in August, 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire was found hanged after she had been sent abusive messages on a social networking site. Since then research by the NSPCC has suggested a fifth of 11 to 16-year-olds have had negative experiences using the internet. The Oxford University research highlighted a number of dangers from internet use, including the normalising of self-harm and the risk of bullying. It also said there was a "strong link" between internet forums and an increased risk of suicide in particular. But the researchers said some studies had shown that internet forums could support and connect socially isolated people. There were also examples where forum users encouraged positive behaviour, advised others to seek help and congratulated each other for not harming themselves. Report author Prof Keith Hawton said: "Communication via the internet and other electronic means has potential roles in both contributing to and preventing suicidal behaviour in young people. "The next step is going to be development of therapeutic interventions using these channels of communication, especially to access those who do not seek help from clinical services." Joe Ferns of the Samaritans added: "We should acknowledge that many people are using suicide forums and chatrooms to anonymously discuss their feelings of distress and despair, including suicidal thoughts, which may have a positive impact on the individual. They may be expressing feelings that they have never disclosed to anyone in their offline lives. "Rather than concentrating primarily on ways of blocking and censoring such sites, we should think about online opportunities to reach out to people in emotional distress." </body>

      <title>Ed Balls attacks Shoesmith payout</title>
      <description>A six-figure payout to former Haringey children's services head Sharon Shoesmith "leaves a bad taste in the mouth", says shadow chancellor Ed Balls.</description>

      <body>A six-figure payout to the ex-head of Haringey children's services "leaves a bad taste in the mouth," shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said. Sharon Shoesmith, who earned £133,000 a year, won a ruling in 2011 that she was unfairly sacked after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter. BBC Newsnight revealed the payout could cost Haringey Council up to £600,000. In a statement Ms Shoesmith bid a "final farewell" to Haringey, adding she hoped to resume work with children. Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old, died in 2007 after months of abuse. The boy had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Three people were jailed in 2009, including his mother. The Court of Appeal concluded Ms Shoesmith had been "unfairly scapegoated" and her removal from office in December 2008 by the then Children's Secretary Ed Balls had been "intrinsically unfair and unlawful". One government source told BBC Newsnight that the cost to Haringey Council could be as high as £600,000, although Ms Shoesmith is expected to receive a lower sum. The exact figure may not emerge as there are confidentiality clauses preventing its disclosure but it will be significantly short of the £1m figure it had been reported she was seeking. However, it would appear the package is more than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested Ms Shoesmith was entitled to a minimum of three months' salary plus pensions contributions. Three months' salary would have been about £33,000. Mr Balls said his decision in 2008 as children's secretary to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her job had been right. He told the BBC: "An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services. "They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department, and responsible, ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money." Earlier, Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the payout became "inevitable" after the Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Balls "had made a complete botched job of her dismissal". But he added: "This is going to leave a really bad taste in taxpayers' mouths that a not insubstantial amount of public money is being used to pay off somebody who presided over a dysfunctional department in Haringey [where] a 17-month-old boy died in horrific circumstances." Care minister Norman Lamb said what happened in the aftermath of the Baby P's death was "extraordinary" but he was not in a position to judge the authority's decisions. "But it is pretty shocking, the scale of the reported payout, given what tragedy unfolded in that particular borough." In her statement, posted on an online networking site, Ms Shoesmith said: "A final farewell to Haringey as my case concludes. I wish those of you in children's services, especially in Haringey, success, strength and courage in all that you do. "Children have been my life's work and I hope to continue in some capacity soon now that my PhD is almost complete." A statement from Haringey Council confirmed it had reached a settlement with Ms Shoesmith but that the terms of the settlement were confidential and it was unable to comment further. Some of the cash will come from central government, but Haringey council will foot most of the bill, it is understood. An exact figure is yet to be agreed. The Department for Education declined to comment on the story when contacted by the BBC. But one source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was "furious" about the secrecy over the amount paid to Ms Shoesmith, believing it to be "indefensible". Downing Street said the Department for Education's contribution to the payout would be made public. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Ms Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a settlement since the May 2011 ruling. Ms Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Peter Connelly's mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child's death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

Baroness Sally Morgan claimed it would help close the ability gap between children from poor and well-off families. However Sarah Steel from the Old Station Nursery Group - which runs 10 nurseries across the UK - thinks two is far too young to begin formal education. She told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast: "There seems to be a real squashing and ignoring of the fact that children learn through play. I don't want to see a two year old sitting at at desk." </body>

      <title>German home school families refugees in US</title>
      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. The modern movement started in the 1970s when Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools, says Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <title>Housing association helps tenants to read</title>
      <description>The housing association that also teaches literacy</description>

      <body>A few months ago, Christopher had to ask a neighbour or a friend to read him details of a personal hospital appointment or a letter about his rent. Now he can do it himself. In and out of care homes all his life, Christopher left school at 13, without being able to read and write properly. But his life changed when he saw an advert in the local community centre about the Eastlands Homes Literacy Beacons Project in Manchester. After six weeks of one-to-one tuition with a mentor, he was beginning to make sense of the words around him. "I can pick up my mail and look at it, I can pick up books. Before I'd get a brown letter and I'd have to ask a friend or a partner to help," he says. "It's like being proper independent. I don't have to knock on someone else's door. It's given me more independence and I'm proud of it like, I really am." The Literacy Beacon Project was set up 18 months ago by the not-for-profit housing association Eastlands Homes for its tenants and others in the area. Eastlands has 8,000 properties across east and south-east Manchester and many of these are in some of the most deprived wards in the country. So far more than 40 people have completed the course. The idea is simple - adults who struggle to read and write are matched with a volunteer "champion" or mentor who, after some training, meets with them regularly on a one-to-one basis over a six-week period. The scheme started when front-line staff realised many tenants were struggling to read correspondence from them, using excuses like they had not received the letter or had lost their glasses. Neighbourhood services manager Danny O'Sullivan says: "We knew a lot of our tenants had literacy problems. "From a business point of view, it does us a good turn because they can read our letters and so on, but the drive behind the scheme was to help people in the community. "We want to improve people's lives, we are a community project as well as a housing association." Danny says a lot of people who believe they cannot read or write actually do have some basic literacy skills, but have such low confidence they have convinced themselves they are illiterate. He says: "If something frustrates us, we tend not to do it. Take technology - you'd rather ask the kids. You can do it, but the frustration stops you. "The issue is the negative stereotype in your head, 'I can't read, I don't need to read, I'm not going to read.'" Amanda approached the Literacy Beacons Project because she was struggling to fill out contact sheets in her role as a volunteer mentor for offenders recently released from prison. "I was always behind with the sheets, but I couldn't get anyone else to do it because it's confidential information. Now I've got the confidence to pick up a pen. "I think it's because of the one-to-one support, they made me feel dead confident. I had no confidence to pick up a pen. "But here it's the best thing because it's a one-to-one. If I'm in a classroom I get all nervous and worried I'm going to be called thick, because that's what I've had in my life. It's all about my confidence, my champion gives me loads of encouragement. "It's amazing, I've got someone saying I'm good and that makes me feel better about myself. It's made me feel really confident in my reading and writing. "I can go for a job now, I've got the confidence to go for that job and go to the interview." But it's not just the tenants who have benefited from the scheme. Eastlands has found that those who volunteer as champions have reaped huge rewards. Paul, a champion who has helped four people develop their reading, says: "I retired a few years ago and I get so much reward out of this - I never got the buzz that I get out of this. It's time-consuming but it's lovely to do. "As much as they're learning, we're learning from them because we're understanding their issues. All my working life I've never enjoyed anything like this." Sam, who has mentored five tenants, adds: "It's so rewarding to see what you've achieved for somebody. "It's better as well because we're not teachers and we don't spell everything right. They feel at ease with one person and they don't have to feel that someone's ahead of them." Sam was particularly touched by the case of one elderly lady who had been constrained by literacy problems all her life. "I had a 75-year-old lady and only her husband knew she had trouble with reading and writing," she says. "When he passed away, she was on her own. She was buying the same things in the supermarket because that was what she recognised. But now she can read the labels - she has the choice." Champions are not just community volunteers - staff working for the housing association are also encouraged to mentor those who sign up for the project. Eastlands communications manager Abi Mistry says: "I had a woman with three kids and she'd never been able to leave her children little notes. When she finally wrote a letter to her eight-year-old son, she cried - and I cried, it was so emotional. "She had left school with no qualifications, had her first child at 17 and couldn't help them with their homework. To see her confidence grow was amazing." The housing association is now so confident with the scheme, it hopes to take it to other areas of need, such as prisons and rehabilitation centres. Danny O'Sullivan says: "We're in talks with the National Literacy Trust. We're trying to grow it, to get it elsewhere. It's a great system and we hope it'll go out further. "I'd like to see a lot of other organisations doing it and not just housing associations. It would be brilliant in prisons, in probation offices, drug rehabilitation centres, community charities, anywhere that socially deprived people are accessing. "We understand it well enough now to take it to other places." Amanda wants to see the project benefit other people like her. She says: "I just think it should be rolled out everywhere because there are people out there, especially older people, who would be too scared to say, 'I can't read or write.'" In the meantime, the literacy project has been shortlisted in the Business in the Community category at the Manchester Be Proud Awards. </body>

      <body>By the year 2020 the US is expected to have 1.4 million computing-related jobs, but will only have the capacity to fill a third of them. Should schools in the United States be looking to Asia for tips on how to get more students to study science and maths? From a young age, children at India's top schools have it drilled into them that they must excel in maths and science. Their goal is to win a coveted place at one of the 16 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and a fast track to a high-flying job. The IITs enjoy no international ranking but they have been recognised by the US Congress and Microsoft founder Bill Gates for their contribution to US innovation. Graduates have gone on to be leading high-tech innovators - for example the creator of Google news Krishna Bharat, and the co-founders of online poker site PartyGaming studied at the IITs. Each year about one million Indian students sit the entrance exam hoping for this kind of success, but just 10,000 people, or 1% of them make it. There are nine times more people applying for each place than there are applying to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the highest-ranking universities in the world. One student who made the grade is 21 year old Utkarsh Malhotra. He is now in his final year but says passing the entrance exam was like scaling an academic Mount Everest. "I know people who changed their diets, who changed their sleeping patterns, who changed everything for this examination," he says. "IITs are like a pressure cooker situation so I don't know if this prepares us for future life well or not." Eighteen year-old Twinkle Aurora is hoping to follow in Malhotra's footsteps. She attends a private coaching institute and spends 13 hours a day, six days a week studying to pass the exam. "It's very tough because you can't stay in touch with social media like Facebook and WhatsApp - they take a lot of your time, so you have to sacrifice lots of friendships… but after one year when you've slogged your way through the year you get something that's big," she says. But once the students are in, the pressure remains. I met Malhotra on a Friday afternoon but instead of winding down for the weekend, he was working hard. "I don't know [if any other] institutes in India have exams on a weekend but this one does. The pressure is immense and you grow to live with it," he says. So what makes the IITs so successful? "We get the best students in the country," says Suneet Tuli, the dean of research and development at the Delhi campus. "And for a country of 1.2 billion, the best is really the best." "The second thing - this is part of our culture, [education is] based a lot on mathematics, so that gives them good analytical skills." Some think the US could learn from the way India approaches science and maths, including Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google. She thinks there should be much more emphasis on computer science in US schools. "Nine out of 10 schools right now are not teaching computer science. If you think about the future and you think about how important computer science is going to be it's a problem - we're going to need a lot more kids to be able to have those skills," she says. "I would really like it to be like reading and math and science and spelling - they are requirements - everybody takes it, everybody learns it, and that's the way I think we need to think about computer science and coding in the future." There has been some criticism of the methods the Indian education system uses with its reliance on rote learning, and whether this really prepares the IIT students for the wider world. Steve Stepanian, head of Indian operations for the management consultancy Bain and Company, has some reservations. "At the more junior levels they are very quantitatively sound, they are very responsible, no problem. The issue becomes [when] they're given an open-ended question - that is where there seems to be more of a struggle," he says. For example, they would get the basic figures spot on, but when he asks what advice they would give to a chief executive - "that is where you draw a real blank," he says. In his experience, the number crunching by US students may not be as accurate, but "when I come to that question of what the CEO should do, they are much more capable of synthesising that and pulling together a much more cohesive answer and make a recommendation". But for Wojcicki it is about the balance between learning the basics and thinking creatively: "I look at Silicon Valley and we have so many great engineers that have come from India," she says. "American schools are really good [when it comes to] thinking about the creative component but we also need kids to learn the basics."

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>Biggest educator you've never heard of</title>
      <description>The biggest education provider you've never heard of</description>

      <body>This is the biggest education provider you've never heard of. Until now. The Alison project - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - has already signed up more than two million students to more than 500 online courses. It's adding another 200,000 each month and founder Mike Feerick is confident this expansion could accelerate even more rapidly and reach a billion students towards the end of the decade. But this ambitious project isn't another Silicon Valley spin-off, fuelled by venture capital and a surfeit of sunshine and flow charts. This global digital empire is based in a technology park in Galway in the west of Ireland. If there was such a thing as successful grey skies thinking, on a damp autumn day, this would be a prime location. But Alison's days in the shade could be numbered, as it has won a prestigious international award this week at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar. The online learning platform has already won an innovation award from Unesco. So how has it stayed below the radar? While the new wave of online courses - so-called Moocs, such as Coursera and edX, have become darlings of the digital media, why has Alison not had the same attention? Mr Feerick says the big difference is who they are trying to reach. It's the academic versus vocational divide being played out in the digital market. "The people we're helping do not have a huge voice," says Mr Feerick. While the Moocs are associated with high-status universities, Alison's focus is on the vast numbers of people around the world needing to improve their vocational skills and training. There are courses in subjects such as computer skills, learning English, basic accountancy, building a website, food safety, immunology, introductions to legal studies. He is planning to expand into secondary school level, with video lessons customised for national exam systems, beginning with maths. Organisations from the IMF to the OECD to the European Union have all spoken of the urgency of providing vocational, workplace skills to tackle dangerously high levels of youth unemployment. But Alison has been putting this into practice. A deal struck earlier this year will provide online training for 12 million young people in the Arab world. Many of those accessing the free courses are at the margins of formal education - low-skilled workers, the unemployed and immigrants. Within the coming months, India is expected to become the biggest source of learners, overtaking the UK and US. Nigeria and the Philippines are rapidly growing markets. Mr Feerick wants to use online technology to offer free lessons in the most important basic skills that people need. As he puts it, 99% of the people are learning the same 1% of information, again and again. His other challenge to the established order, heresy to some, is to question the necessity of exam certificates. If people are studying for a specific skill, such as learning to touch-type or a language, he argues the key question is whether they can put the lessons into practice. He says the fixation with a paper trail of certification is part of protecting an educational status quo. "They desperately want to keep the same system." Alison's other big difference is that it is profitable. The courses are free because of advertising revenue. The social mission is underpinned by a strong business sense. Mr Feerick says his approach to social entrepreneurship was influenced by his own business mentor, Chuck Feeney, a celebrated US investor in ideas and education, who took him under his wing when Mr Feerick had been studying at Harvard. Mr Feeney is a famously frugal and publicity-shy billionaire and philanthropist, who is currently helping to fund New York's hi-tech science campus. Inspired by his example, Mr Feerick says he wanted to combine thinking big commercially while maintaining a sense of social purpose. The idea of free education online, available around the globe, became his focus. "Education underpins all social progress. It's the tool of the most ambitious revolutionary in these technological times, you can change the world if you can change education." He sees the internet as making an irresistible impact on education, in the way it has in other industries, with a few giants emerging to dominate the multi-trillion dollar education market. "There is going to be huge consolidation worldwide into a small number of platforms for learning, because it's going to be very hard to compete with them," he predicts, likening it to how Amazon has become the global bookseller. "So these platforms are going to be huge, some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world." There are other projects challenging the idea that online learning should be dominated by prestigious Western universities. The Kepler project, launched in September, is using online technology to bring university lessons to Rwanda, to students who otherwise would have no chance of getting into higher education. Using laptops they can take lectures and resources from top universities putting course material online. In the Rwandan campus there are local teachers who are able to provide face-to-face lessons, with a ratio of 30 students for each member of staff. If they successfully complete their course they can get a US accredited degree. There are 50 students in a pilot phase, being charged $1,000 per year. If it works, this will expand rapidly and the longer-term aim is to reach 7,000 to 10,000 students. "There is a rising demand for higher education in Africa that can't be met by traditional models," says Jamie Hodari, chief executive of the non-profit organisation. The economy in Rwanda is growing, but if it wants to compete with other countries it is severely limited by low levels of education. "They have completely hit a wall," says Mr Hodari. Rwanda has ambitions to become a regional technology hub, but it lacks a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. At present, Mr Hodari says "so many children leave as the top of their class and go on to become taxi drivers, because there is no other pathway". The Kepler idea reflects the way that technology is dismantling the component parts of education - separating the local teaching from the online course materials and the international accreditation. If the format works, Mr Hodari says it could be replicated in other parts of Africa and beyond. It could be a "university in a box" that others could copy, he says. "The playbook will be right there in front of them." </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>Farming key to closing emissions gap</title>
      <description>A new study suggests that simple changes to agriculture could play a significant role in plans to cut global greenhouse emissions by 2020.</description>

      <body>Changing farming practices could play an important role in averting dangerous climate change says the UN. In their annual emissions report, they measure the difference between the pledges that countries have made to cut warming gases and the targets required to keep temperatures below 2C. On present trends there is likely to be an annual excess of 8 to 12 gigatonnes of these gases by 2020. Agriculture, they say, could make a significant difference to the gap. This is the fourth such report, compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) in conjunction with 44 scientific groups in 17 countries. It says the world needs to reduce total emissions to 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020 to keep the planet from going above the 2C target, agreed at a UN meeting in Cancun in 2010. But when all the pledges and plans made by countries are added together, they show an excess of between 8 and 12 gigatonnes per annum in seven years time, very similar to last year's report. To put it in context, 12 gigatonnes is about 80% of all the emissions coming from all the power plants in the world right now. The authors highlight a number of ways in which this gap can be closed, including tightening the rules for counting emissions and expanding the scope of pledges already made. They believe around half the gap could be closed in this way. But they say that simple changes in agriculture could cut emissions by four gigatonnes, about two thirds of the remaining difference. Emissions from farming, including nitrous oxide from applying fertiliser and CO2 from ploughing fields accounts for more than 10% of the global total right now. "The potential is enormous," said Dr Joseph Alcamo from the UN Environment Programme. "It's not with anything very exotic, it has to do with the way we apply fertilisers to our fields, it has to do with conservation tillage so you don't plough the fields very rigorously." Conservation tillage includes a number of methods including leaving the previous year's crop residues on the fields to help protect the soils. The UN cited the example of Argentina where 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided by a shift to conservation tillage that took place in the 1990s. They argue that not only would it curb global warming, it would help poor farmers as well. "You could take a big step down the pathway of sustainable agriculture," said Dr Alcamo, "You can unite ideas of sustainable agriculture for the whole world together with ideas of controlling emissions by 2020." The report highlighted a number of other measures that could bridge the looming gap including energy efficiency, greater emphasis on renewables and reform of fossil fuel subsidies. "A lot of these actions have been done not for climate mitigation but to further national and local interest," said Dr Alcamo. The study makes the point that if action on curbing greenhouse gases isn't taken in the short term, then the possibilities of getting emissions down in the future becomes much more difficult. "Remember 44 gigatonnes by 2020 just sets the stage for further cuts that will be needed," said Unep executive director Achim Steiner. "We need 40 gigatonnes by 2025, 35 gigatonnes by 2030 and 22 gigatonnes by 2050. "At the moment the trend is in the opposite direction, we are over 50 gigatonnes." Next week, delegates from all over the world will gather in Warsaw to continue negotiations on a new global climate agreement that is expected to be signed in 2015. According to Mr Steiner, the emissions gap report shows just how much needs to be done. "This report provides a very sobering perspective of where we are and still heading and quite how far- reaching the implications are of maintaining this trajectory." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>One in five suns has habitable world</title>
      <description>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet. Using data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope, they argue that one in five stars like the Sun hosts an Earth-sized world located in the "habitable zone". This zone is the region around a star where temperatures allow for water - a key ingredient for life - to stay liquid at the surface. The researchers have published details in the journal PNAS. "What this means is, when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest Sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye," said co-author Erik Petigura, from the University of California, Berkeley. He added: "That is amazing." His UC Berkeley colleague Andrew Howard said the discovery showed that planets like our own were relatively common throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Last week, astronomers announced the discovery of an Earth-sized, rocky planet orbiting its star at a hundredth of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Temperatures on this world would reach between 2,000C and 2,800C, with much of the dayside molten, meaning there would be little chance for life here. But team members cautioned that even finding Earth-sized planets in the habitable - or "Goldilocks" - zones of their stars was no guarantee these worlds would be hospitable to life. "Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive," said another author, Geoff Marcy, professor of astronomy at Berkeley. But Prof Marcy added: "Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbour liquid water suitable for living organisms. "We don't know what range of planet types and their environments are suitable for life." Researchers had previously combed through some 42,000 stars and discovered 600 likely planets. Of these, 10 were both Earth-sized and located at a distance that was just right for liquid water to persist on the surface. However, the team then corrected for planets that might have been missed by software designed to sift through the Kepler data for planet signatures. This process involved introducing fake planets into the data. Accounting for these missed worlds, as well as the fact that only a small fraction of planets are oriented so that they cross in front of their host star as seen from Earth, the astronomers were able to estimate that 22% of all Sun-like stars in the Milky Way have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. "For Nasa, this number - that every fifth star has a planet somewhat like Earth - is really important, because successor missions to Kepler will try to take an actual picture of a planet, and the size of the telescope they have to build depends on how close the nearest Earth-size planets are," Andrew Howard said. "An abundance of planets orbiting nearby stars simplifies such follow-up missions." </body>

      <body>India has successfully launched a spacecraft to the Red Planet - with the aim of becoming the fourth space agency to reach Mars. The Mars Orbiter Mission took off at 09:08 GMT from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the country's east coast. The head of India's space agency told the BBC the mission would demonstrate the technological capability to reach Mars orbit and carry out experiments. The spacecraft is set to travel for 300 days, reaching Mars orbit in 2014. If the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the US, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. In order for the MOM to embark on the right trajectory for its 300-day, 780-million km journey, it must carry out its final orbital burn by 30 November. Some observers are viewing the launch of the MOM, also known by the informal name of Mangalyaan (Mars-craft), as the latest salvo in a burgeoning space race between the Asian powers of India, China, Japan, South Korea and others. Prof Andrew Coates, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, told BBC News: "I think this mission really brings India to the table of international space exploration. Interplanetary exploration is certainly not trivial to do, and [India] has found some interesting scientific niches to make some measurements in." Those niche areas include searching for the signature of methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere, which has previously been detected from Martian orbit and telescopes on Earth. However, Nasa's Curiosity rover recently failed to find the gas in its measurements of atmospheric gases. CH4 has a short lifetime in the Martian atmosphere, meaning that some source on the Red Planet must replenish it. Intriguingly, some 95% of atmospheric methane on Earth is produced by microbes, which has led some to propose the possibility of a biosphere deep beneath the Martian surface. But the gas can be produced by geological processes too, most notably by volcanism. Definitive conclusions are likely to be elusive, but the spacecraft's Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) instrument will aim to make measurements and map any potential sources of methane "plumes". The spacecraft will also examine the rate of loss of atmospheric gases to outer space. This could provide insights into the planet's history; billions of years ago, the envelope of gases around Mars is thought to have been more substantial. At $72m (£45m), the mission is comparatively cheap, but some commentators have still questioned whether a country with one of the highest rankings for childhood malnutrition in the world should be spending millions on a mission to the Red Planet. In one sense, India was left in a quandary because of the failure of its most powerful launcher, the first choice to loft the MOM into orbit. It meant the country's space agency could no longer fire the satellite directly out of Earth's atmosphere. As a fuel-saving alternative, the spacecraft will circle Earth in an elliptical orbit for nearly a month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. The formal name for the route MOM will take to Mars is a "Hohmann Transfer Orbit". The spacecraft takes advantage of a favourable planetary alignment, carrying out six small engine burns over November to lift it to a higher orbit before a final burn sends it off on an interplanetary trajectory. The difficulty of visiting the Red Planet will not be lost on Indian officials; just under half the total attempts to reach Mars have succeeded. But Prof Coates said the planned mechanics for getting to Mars were on a sound footing, and that the probe stood a good chance as long as its engines fired correctly. Those who defend India's current direction in space exploration say the technological development required to mount this mission could indirectly benefit the country's other activities, including poverty reduction. Nisha Agrawal, chief executive of Oxfam in India, told the BBC: "India is home to poor people but it's also an emerging economy, it's a middle-income country, it's a member of the G20. What is hard for people to get their head around is that we are home to poverty but also a global power. "We are not really one country but two in one. And we need to do both things: contribute to global knowledge as well as take care of poor people at home." K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told the BBC's India Business Report: "Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: 'It is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society.' He added: "A great revolution has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme." Mr Radhakrishnan played down talk of a race between China and India in space, commenting: "We are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services." But a successful launch would allow India to surge ahead of regional rival China, at least in the exploration of Mars. China's Yinghuo-1 spacecraft was to have reached Martian orbit in late 2012. But it was piggybacked on the Russian Phobos Grunt spacecraft, which became stranded in low-Earth orbit shortly after launch in November 2011. The MOM was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to postpone lift-off. </body>

      <title>Badger cull fails to meet target</title>
      <description>Some 940 badgers were killed in total during a pilot cull, which was lower than the planned target, the government admits.</description>

      <body>One of the badger cull pilot schemes failed to meet its target - even after a three-week extension, the government has admitted. The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were "designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers". "I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November," said Mr Paterson. "During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. "This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. "While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane." Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a "complete failure" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' "The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards," said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. "Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. "The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping." Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because "the badgers have moved the goalposts". "By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations," she said. "David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed." </body>

      <title>Coastal retreat plan to curb floods</title>
      <description>The UK's largest ever coastal flood realignment sees a part of the West Sussex coast given back to the sea to increase protection.</description>

      <body>A scheme to combat flooding by surrendering land to the sea will be completed on Monday on the south coast. The £28m "managed realignment" at Medmerry in West Sussex has seen the building of 7km (four miles) of new sea walls up to 2km inland. By letting the waters in, the Environment Agency says the risk of flooding for hundreds of homes will be reduced. The surrendered land will become a wetland habitat for many species. The sea has long been a threatening presence on the flat land of the Manhood Peninsula that juts into the English channel on the coast between Portsmouth and Worthing. Caravan parks in Selsey and Bracklesham Bay have been flooded a number of times in recent years, as the shingle defences have yielded to the surging seas. Since 2011, the Environment Agency have been working on a plan that they believe curbs that threat. The project is billed as the country's largest ever coastal flood realignment scheme, but it has required the destruction of the existing sea wall at Medmerry and giving back to the sea some of the land nearest to the coast. "We have made a hole in the sea wall," the Environment Agency's flood and coastal risk manager, Andrew Gilham, told BBC News on a visit to the site. "But before doing that we've actually built 7km of new defences further inland from the coast. What we've been able to create here is an area that can absorb the energy of the waves and reduce the flood risk to people." Although the new walls are much closer to local communities, the Agency says homes are much better protected as a result, with the development able to withstand a once in a thousand year flood. The change is partly being forced on the Agency because of EU legislation that requires compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat through development. The Medmerry scheme makes up for the loss of similar conservation areas in and around the Solent. "It is not politically driven," said Mr Gilham. "But the benefit of creating the habitat here is not only to reduce flood risk in this area but also to reduce flood risk to communities in Portsmouth and Southampton. "If we weren't able create habitat here we wouldn't be be able to do those defences." The scale of the £28m development is enormous. Between the new earthen walls and the sea stand 183 hectares of land that the Agency says will rapidly become a saltwater marsh, with potentially huge benefits for wildlife in the area. It will be managed by the RSPB. "Even in construction, we're seeing lots of migratory birds using this area," said Andrew Gilham. "It is already starting to be used by the wildlife. It's a massive nature reserve and a massive opportunity on the south coast." Local people are hoping that letting the sea in will not only protect their homes but boost the local economy as well. Alan Chamberlain is the estate manager of the newly renamed Medmerry Park holiday village. His business, located next door to the new habitat, is actually below sea level. "In the past we have been very close to flooding, and now we've got a one-in-one-thousand-year protection, one of the best in the country actually," he told BBC News. "For us it's a win win, it will encourage visitors to the site, birdwatchers and those interested in nature." The new development is facing its first big test on the day it opens as it will see one of the highest tides of the year. But the Environment Agency are fully confident it will pass with flying colours. Medmerry is one of a number of managed realignment projects that the Environment Agency are involved in. Andrew Gilham says it's part of a new approach. "Rather than fighting it, we are working with nature," he explained. "It's an important change in approach, you can only keep building bigger and bigger defences for so long. We have to ask if we can make better use of public money. "Certainly the habitat we are creating here is important to the broader ecosystem and the broader economy of the country by encouraging people to visit remote areas." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Prostate cancer test 'may save ops'</title>
      <description>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest.</description>

      <body>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest. Early data, presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference, suggests a genetic test can tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours. A big challenge in treating the cancer is knowing whether surgery to remove the gland is needed. Cancer charities said a successful test would be a "game-changer". Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK. There are more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed and 10,000 deaths each year. The decision to remove the prostate is based on an examination of a tumour sample under the microscope. However, the procedure has significant side-effects such as infertility, difficulty maintaining and keeping an erection and uncontrolled urinating. One of the researchers, Prof Dan Berney, from Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC: "We need a better test as we are over-treating many men; most will die with, not of, prostate cancer. "We need to discriminate between the aggressive forms and those that will grumble along and just need monitoring." The commercial test, developed by Myriad Genetics but independently assessed by Queen Mary University of London, looks at the activity level of genes inside a sample of the tumour. If 31 genes involved in controlling how cells divide are highly active, it indicates the cancer is aggressive. Prof Berney said such information could "substantially change" decisions made by doctors and patients but the costs were "huge" and it was certainly not going to be offered on the NHS in the next few years. "We need to validate it and we're not there yet, but it is the strongest test we've had so far," he added. Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: "Developing an effective test to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer could be a game-changer for those affected by the condition. "We urgently need to reach a point where we can focus resources on saving more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year, whilst sparing the many others who needn't have concerns. "The results of this study are certainly intriguing, and take us a step closer to the diagnostic process for prostate cancer that men deserve. We will watch with great interest developments in this area." Dr Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: "Being able to tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours would help us take a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment. "Understanding more about the nature of a patient's tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side-effects, whilst also meaning that those who do need treatment receive it rapidly." </body>

      <body>A rare solar eclipse allowing a view of the Sun that is totally or partially blocked by the Moon has taken place. It was first visible in the southern United States, before sweeping east across the Atlantic Ocean and the African continent. The US space agency, Nasa, said the greatest total eclipse occurred over the Atlantic Ocean. One of the best views was in northern Kenya, where tour companies organised trips to view a total blackout. Local myths there attribute the event to the Moon eating the Sun. Partial views were available in eastern North America and southern Europe. This solar eclipse was a rare occurrence in that it was "hybrid" - switching between an annular and total eclipse. In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the sun, while an annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is at its farthest from the Earth and does not block out the Sun completely, leaving a halo of sunlight still visible around the Moon. The eclipse event began about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Jacksonville, Florida with an annular eclipse visible for four seconds at sunrise. As the Moon's shadow raced east the eclipse switched from annular to total along a narrow corridor. The greatest total eclipse occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 330km south-west of Liberia, and lasted for more than one minute. The eclipse continued across Africa through the Congos until it passed through northern Uganda and northern Kenya, ending in southern Ethiopia and Somalia. Either side, a partial eclipse was seen within a much broader path including eastern North America, northern South America, southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Experts warned that no-one should attempt to view the Sun with the naked eye. A safe view of eclipses can be obtained by using special welder's glasses or a pinhole camera. </body>

      <title>Trees help at-risk species keep cool</title>
      <description>Dense tree canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study shows.</description>

      <body>Forests with dense canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study has shown. Researchers found plants that favoured cooler conditions fared better under dense canopies than in ones that were more open to the elements. They added that these conditions could be a "critical mechanism" in the conservation of forest plant diversity. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A team of international researchers, headed by scientists from Belgium, noted that previous studies had shown that "biological signals of recent global warming" had been increasing across an array of ecosystems. "Around the globe, climate warming is increasing the dominance of warm-adapted species - a process described as 'thermophilisation'," they observed. The team gathered data from vegetation survey from more than 1,400 plots in temperate forests across North America and Europe. In each plot, they compared the results from an original survey with a repeated survey that was, on average, carried out 34.5 years later. The results showed that there had been a sizeable turnover, with about one-third of the species present in the original survey being replaced by other plants. Shaded sanctuary However, they also found that the thermophilisation of vegetation was lowest in forests where canopies had become denser. "These results suggest that recent forest canopy closure in northern hemisphere temperate forests has buffered the impacts of macroclimate warming on ground-layer plant communities, thus slowing changes in community composition," they wrote. As well as lowering temperatures, the dense canopy cover also increased relative air humidity and shade within forests' understorey. The researchers explained that these conditions also offered protection to forest herbs and tree seedlings from summer drought, "decreasing mortality and thus buffering the impacts of large-scale climate change". They noted that in western Europe, a number of factors - such as changes to management regimes - had resulted in increased tree growth and forest densities. "Logging and natural losses of tree biomass have been consistently lower than annual growth increments, resulting in an almost doubling of standing stocks of trees per hectare between 1950 and 2000," they wrote. Temperate forests account for about 16% of the world's tree cover, while understorey plants account for 80% of the flora diversity found in these habitats. Co-author Keith Kirby, a woodland ecologist from the University of Oxford's Department of Plant Sciences, said the microclimate created by a dense forest canopy allowed some plants to remain within their comfort zone. However, he warned: "The other thing we must remember is that this moderating characteristic only works as long as you have got the canopy there. "At some stage, the trees themselves may die from disease, they may get felled or they themselves might succumb to the effects of climate change. "Once that happens, what we might then see is that the ground flora might start to shift quite rapidly, so we might have things keeping relatively stable for quite a while but then we pass a tipping point once the canopy opens up." After a prolonged post-war hiatus, traditional woodland management techniques - such as coppicing - are becoming popular once again. But Dr Kirby told BBC News that this study's findings suggested that a more considered approach might be needed. He observed: "This might be a case to say hold on a minute because if we start coppicing and opening up the canopies, we will also be exposing these plants to future climate change more. "Maybe in the future we should be reducing the extent that we break up canopies." But he added that perhaps "the gentle intervention" of management techniques was needed in order to strengthen woodlands' resilience to the threats posed by pests, pathogens and extreme weather events. </body>

      <title>US to build hypersonic spy plane</title>
      <description>The US has revealed plans to develop a robot spy plane that is designed to fly at six times the speed of sound.</description>

      <body>Lockheed Martin has begun work on a successor to the supersonic Blackbird SR-71 spy plane. The unmanned SR-72 will use an engine that combines a turbine and a ramjet to reach its top speed of Mach 6 - about 3,600mph (5,800km/h). Like its predecessor, the SR-72 will be designed for high-altitude surveillance but might also be fitted with weapons to strike targets. Lockheed said the aircraft should be operational by 2030. The SR-72 is being developed at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works RandD centre in California that designed and built the original Blackbird. That aircraft first flew in 1964 and was a mainstay of US Air Force spying and surveillance work until 1998. It typically flew at altitudes of 24,000m (80,000ft) and could reach speeds of Mach 3. In a blogpost about the SR-72, Lockheed Martin said the aircraft would operate at similar altitudes but would fly far faster. At Mach 6 the plane could travel the 3,500 miles (5,500km) from New York to London in less than an hour. While spy satellites can photograph enemy territory, the relatively long time it takes for them to be moved to a new orbit so they pass over a target can limit their usefulness. By contrast, wrote Lockheed Martin, the SR-72 "would be so fast, an adversary would have no time to react or hide". For the SR-72, Lockheed Martin is drawing on work done on the Falcon HTV-2 hypersonic technology vehicle. This is a test-bed for the futuristic technologies needed to support safe hypersonic flight and cope with the extreme conditions encountered by any object flying at such a speed. For instance, on one test flight of the HTV-2, the aircraft hit a top speed of Mach 20 and its flight surfaces reached 1,927C (3,500F). To reach Mach 6, the SR-72 will use an engine that acts like a normal jet turbine until speeds of Mach 3 are reached but which then operates like a ramjet to accelerate beyond that. "Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades," said Brad Leland, Lockheed Martin's hypersonic programme manager on the blog. "The technology would be a game-changer in theatre, similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today." </body>

      <body>People are being asked to offer their views on how the English countryside should look. The government has opened a consultation on the priorities for spending nearly £20bn of EU subsidies over the next seven years. The budget has been cut overall and there is huge controversy about how it should be shared between helping farmers and protecting wildlife. The decisions will have an impact on hedgerows, trees, wild flowers, birds, bees, water quality and the appearance of the landscape. An EU settlement in the summer has given individual nations more discretion on how to spend funds. Some countries want to prioritise direct help for farmers, but the UK government says farmers should have to earn their cash as much as possible by working in a way that benefits the environment. Ministers want to divert the maximum amount of 15% into rural development and green schemes. They aim to help hill farmers and to create shelter for pollinators, such as bees and moths. But this has worried big farmers, who they say they will lose out and get less direct payment than some of their European counterparts. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) president, Peter Kendall, said: "English farmers are already significantly disadvantaged in comparison with their near neighbours in the EU." Environmentalists are not happy either. They argue the government's plans have failed to ensure that whole landscapes are farmed in a way that safeguards water quality and the environment. Helen Perkins from the Wildlife Trusts said: "We need to see farming for nature mainstreamed - with environmental standards raised on every farm so that exemplary practices aren't restricted to pockets of the countryside." Campaigners are perplexed that the government has given the public just 28 days to respond to the consultation on an immensely complex reform. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own processes over farm budgets. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin </body>

      <title>'Low health risk' from fracking</title>
      <description>The risks to public health from fracking for shale gas are low, according to a new official report.</description>

      <body>The risks to public health from fracking for shale gas are low, according to a new official report. Any problems publicised so far - such as in the US - are the result of operational failure or poor regulation. The study, by Public Health England, an agency of the Department of Health, reviewed the latest research. It focused on the risks of emissions of the chemicals used in fracking and radioactive material released with the gas. The central conclusion is that "potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction are low if the operations are properly run and regulated". The report recommends environmental monitoring through the lifetime of any project and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracking fluid. The findings have been welcomed by the government which is pressing for the development of shale gas in the UK. Environmental campaigners opposed to fracking say the study highlights the risks and the lack of oversight. So far exploratory fracking has been limited to one site in Lancashire but the British Geological Survey (BGS) estimates UK shale could yield 150 billion cubic metres of gas, so commercial interest is growing. The report draws on American research to conclude that though pollutants can enter the air from gas flaring or leaks, "these emissions are relatively small, intermittent and certainly not unique to shale gas extraction…" One quoted study - from the Barnett Shale in Texas in 2010 - found 70 individual volatile organic compounds including ethane, propane, butane and pentanes close to shale gas activity but observed these to be "localised" and significantly diminished downwind. But the authors recognise that there is relatively little evidence to go on - the only detailed peer reviewed study of the impact of air emissions was published last year by the Colorado School of Public Health. That work found that people living within half-a-mile of gas wells had an elevated risk of health conditions including neurological and respiratory effects. However the Colorado study was criticised for having a small sample size and the Public Health England report says local weather and topography may mean that similar results may not be likely in Britain. The PHE report acknowledges that extracting shale gas could produce residues containing naturally-occurring radioactive materials - but it argues that these risks would be similar to those in the existing oil and gas industry. On the dangers of groundwater being contaminated, the study quotes a 2011 paper by MIT researchers who found that nearly half of 43 pollution incidents were related to drilling operations - mainly because of faulty sealing of wells. According to the PHE study, American experience points to surface spills of chemicals being the most likely to affect water sources. However it points out that 99% of drinking water in England comes from heavily-regulated water companies so the risk is "considered minimal". The remainder who get their water from private wells are "particularly vulnerable" - but "high quality well integrity" should protect water sources. Another risk examined is from the chemicals used in the fracking process. An American study found 75% of them could affect skin, eyes and breathing while 25% are carcinogenic. For that reason, the PHE study calls for full disclosure of the chemicals used and strict enforcement of chemicals handling and of well design. Overall, the study concludes that the well-publicised problems experienced in the US may not be replicated in the UK because of differences in geology, operation and regulation. The energy minister Michael Fallon welcomed the findings. "The UK has the most robust regulatory regime in the world for shale gas and companies will only be granted permission to frack for shale if their operations are safe," he said. However Greenpeace campaigner Leila Deen said the report was a "timely reminder" of the risks of fracking and the potential long-term health impacts. "The government has so far responded to these risks by cutting the budget of the environmental regulator and effectively allowing companies to mark their own homework when it comes to monitoring." </body>

      <body>A wild boar which has been on the loose in Alderney for more than a month is thought to have swum there from the nearby French coast. The boar found its way into a pig farm on Friday but, when approached, escaped by jumping over a 1m (3ft) stock fence. Farm owner Tess Woodnutt said she would not have believed the animal could jump so high from a standing start, if she had not seen it with her own eyes. Islanders have dubbed the boar "ghost pig", as it has only been seen at dusk. Mrs Woodnutt said she first became aware of the boar on 27 September, when she was on holiday and received a call from a fellow islander saying one of their 40 pigs had escaped. Her son Jake immediately went to the farm and soon established no pigs were missing. Steve Shaw, who was Alderney harbour master for 25 years, said he did not believe it would be possible for a wild boar to get to the island by boat without the crew noticing, and he had never heard of a wild boar being found on any vessel. Some islanders have speculated the animal could be an "iron age pig", which have been farmed on the island. However, Alan Woodnutt, Tess's husband, said he was certain it was not. "Iron age pigs are a cross between a wild boar and a Tamworth," he said. "They look a bit like a wild boar but this animal was not the progeny of an iron age pig." Mrs Woodnutt said the boar's arrival on the island was a mystery but she had had it confirmed to her by an expert in the UK that a wild boar could swim long distances in open water. Wild boar are commonly found in Normandy, the coast of which lies seven miles (11km) to the east of Alderney. Duty Insp Kieran McGrath from Guernsey Police said islanders should contact them if they spotted the animal and should not approach it themselves, as any wild boar could be dangerous when cornered. </body>

      <title>Scientists decipher dog-tail wags</title>
      <description>The way a dog moves it tail can shed light on its mood - and other dogs can spot and respond to these differences, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood. Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish. But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences. The study is published in the journal Current Biology. Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions. "Here we attempted to look at it in other species." He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions. Dogs on film To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs. They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour. Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right." When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed. But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious. Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements. Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about. He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience." The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions. Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines. Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog. And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the [Italian] study." He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines. A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained. "While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said. "However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other." </body>

      <title>Forbidden City rocks carried on ice</title>
      <description>The huge stones that make up China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says.</description>

      <body>Huge stones that make up parts of China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says. That's despite the fact that wheeled vehicles had been developed 3,000 years earlier. The colossal city was built in the 15th Century by workers at the start of the Ming dynasty. Writing in PNAS journal, the team says that wood-on-ice sliding was more reliable than using wheels. Using sledges on ice was much more expensive and needed more workers but it was deemed a safer method than mule-powered transport. Howard Stone, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, said that on his first tour of the Forbidden City, he and colleagues were curious about how some of the huge stones had been transported. "There's a story on a sign that comments about an ice pack, so we started to investigate it," he told BBC News. "The funny thing about that sign is if you go to the leading scholarship on the science and technology of China, they don't indicate this as far as we can tell. "Most scholarly work indicates that the Chinese had the wheel in 1500 BC and the conclusion from that was they didn't have any need for sledges dragged by man. The Forbidden City was built 3,000 years later, so you have a contradiction. "So our suggestion is somehow that they didn't recognise the use of the artificial ice paths to drag these large rock carvings." But when the team translated a 500-year-old document from the historical record, they found a mention of huge stone carvings transported on ice. They then made calculations looking at the friction of ice to see how plausible it would be to drag such large rocks over the short time period in winter, when it was cold enough to do so. Prof Stone said several hundred workers would have been needed to transport stones ranging from 100-300 tonnes. "If you look at the frictional characteristics of ice for the rocks of this size, we estimate that 300 people were needed for this kind of dragging," he explained. Advance planning was also vital, as water had to be laid out in the winter months so it could freeze along the 43-mile (70km) stretch from a quarry outside Beijing. "They would dig wells every kilometre, pour water on the road which would give it a very smooth surface, The ice can support a lot of weight, they were then able to drag these objects," said Prof Stone. Other researchers say they were already aware of the use of ice to transport marble stone, but it had never been published in academic literature. Sally Church, from the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge University, had noticed the use of this method of moving marble after translating a Chinese book in 2007 called Stories of the Forbidden City. It was written in 1962, but based on earlier sources. The text said: "Really huge stones were moved on a contraption called a 'dry ship' or 'land ship'. Large pieces of wood were put together into a raft-like object, and there were two of these. "In very cold weather they poured water onto the roads and let it freeze, then either they or animals would pull it along." Dr Church said that it was "certainly new" and interesting to look at this topic from an engineering perspective. "It is just a small fact that lies buried in the sources in the subject. I would compare it to something like our knowing that the Tower of London once kept elephants and other exotic animals in a sort of zoo," she told BBC News. </body>

      <title>'Platypus-zilla' found in Australia</title>
      <description>Part of a giant platypus fossil, dubbed platypus-zilla, is unearthed in Australia, scientists report.</description>

      <body>Part of a giant platypus fossil has been unearthed in Queensland, Australia. Scientists have dubbed the beast "platypus-zilla" and believe it would have measured more than 1m long (3ft). Writing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the researchers say the creature lived between five and 15 million years ago. The discovery suggests the evolutionary back-story of today's platypus is more complicated than was thought. Prof Mike Archer, from the University of New South Wales, said: "Suddenly up pops 'playtpus-zilla' - this gigantic monstrosity that you would have been afraid to swim with. "It indicates there are branches in the platypus family tree that we hadn't suspected before." Today, all that survives of this platypus is a single fossilised tooth, which was unearthed in the Riversleigh fossil beds in northwest Queensland. Based on its size, the researchers have estimated that the new species (Obdurodon tharalkooschild) would have been at least twice as large as today's platypus. Bumps on its teeth and other fossil finds nearby suggest that the creature feasted on crustaceans, turtles, frogs and fish. Although the area where the molar was found is a desert, millions of years ago it would have been covered in forest. The researchers think the beast would have spent its time in and around freshwater ponds. Prof Archer said that with just one tooth, it was difficult to work out exactly what this species would have looked like. However other fossils suggest that it could have shared the same bizarre appearance as today's platypuses, with their duck-like bills, large webbed feet and poisonous spurs. But this would have been on a much larger scale. "I guess it probably would have looked like a platypus on steroids," said Prof Archer. Fossil platypus finds are in short supply, with just a few fragments found throughout the southern hemisphere. As a result, there are many gaps in our understanding of the creature's past. Prof Archer said: "We have been naively led to suspect that maybe it was just one lineage of strange animals bumbling its way through time and space at least for the last 60 million years. "The discovery of this new one was a bit of a shock to us. It was a wake-up call that the platypus's story, the more we know about it, is increasingly more complicated than we thought." The researchers are now hoping to find more platypus fossils in the same area to try to shed more light these enigmatic Australian animals. Follow Rebecca on Twitter </body>

      <title>Down's pregnancy blood test trialled</title>
      <description>A blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS.</description>

      <body>A simple blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS. It could significantly reduce the number of women needing invasive testing, which can cause miscarriage. The study at Great Ormond Street Hospital will assess how and when the blood test could be introduced across the NHS. In the UK, 750 babies are born with Down's syndrome each year. All pregnant women in the UK are offered screening for Down's syndrome. Currently a woman's risk is assessed, based on her age, an ultrasound scan and markers in the blood. Those deemed at high risk of a child with Down's are offered an invasive test. It involves using a needle to take a sample of either placental cells or of the fluid that bathes the baby - but this procedure carries a one-in-100 chance of miscarriage. The aim is to reduce the number of women having the invasive testing by more accurately assessing the risk. The new blood test, which is already available privately, looks for tiny fragments of DNA from the placenta and the foetus floating in the mother's bloodstream. Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of a massive stretch of DNA - a part or even all of chromosome 21. The test can analyse the free floating DNA for extra copies. It is thought to be 99% accurate. Those with a positive result will still be offered the invasive procedure to confirm the result. Prof Lyn Chitty, from Great Ormond Street who is leading the trial, told the BBC: "It could very significantly reduce the number of invasive tests and increase detection, this is seriously exciting stuff and it would be great to get it into the NHS. "What we are trying to do is give information on how and when to introduce it into the NHS." The NHS National Institute for Health Research funded trial will analyse the scale of the benefit and the best way to inform mothers and train staff, including midwives, about the test. "One of the very important aspects of our study is looking at ways to ensure women understand the test and the implications of the results so that they can choose whether or not to have it," she said. Dr Anne Mackie, from the UK National Screening Committee, said: "Early indications suggest that using Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) to screen women who are found to be at a higher risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome would enable earlier and safer detection of the condition. "[We have] been working in close collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, particularly in looking to ensure the new test does not affect the quality of the current service offered to pregnant women." Carol Boys, the chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association said: "We would be delighted if tests which lead to miscarriage were discontinued. "We understand that the new test is approximately 99% accurate for those women who have already been established as having a high chance of carrying a baby with Down's syndrome, and are interested to see if that accuracy is maintained in women where this has not already been established. The studies for this are still under way." She said the information and education provided to women and health professionals would be important. </body>

      <title>Earth-sized 'lava world' discovered</title>
      <description>A scorching "lava world" with a similar mass and density to that of Earth has been discovered orbiting a star 400 light-years away.</description>

      <body>A doomed "lava world" with a similar mass and density to that of Earth has been discovered orbiting a star 400 light-years away. Observations suggest the planet, named Kepler 78b, is composed mostly of rock and iron, much like our own planet. But its extremely close proximity to its host star - a hundredth of the distance between the Earth and the Sun - remains something of a puzzle. Details of the work by two teams of researchers appear in Nature journal. From theory, astronomers expect the planet to be tidally locked to its host star, which means that one side is permanently facing in, and the other side permanently facing away. Temperatures on Kepler 78b's "dayside" - the side of the planet facing its star - are a searing 2,000C-2,800C, far too hot to support life. "I think it's safe to say that the surface on the 'dayside' is molten," Josh Winn, associate professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), told BBC News. But he added: "Nobody has really calculated whether or not we expect the 'nightside' to be molten (we do not know the temperature of the nightside), nor how far down the molten layer is expected to go within the planet." The hot Earth-twin belongs to a new class of "ultrashort period" planets recently identified by the now-defunct Kepler space telescope. These newfound worlds all complete one circuit of their host star in less than 12 hours. But according to current theories of planet formation, Kepler 78b could not have formed so close to its star, nor could it have moved there. Dimitar Sasselov, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, an author on one of the Nature papers, said: "Kepler 78b is going to end up in the star very soon, astronomically speaking. "It couldn't have formed in place because you can't form a planet inside a star. It couldn't have formed further out and migrated inward, because it would have migrated all the way into the star. This planet is an enigma." Kepler 78b's orbit and size have been determined by analysing the light given off by the star as the planet transits, or passes in front as viewed from Earth. The researchers detected a transit each time the star's light dipped, and measured this dimming to determine the planet's size. This was possible because the bigger an exoplanet is, the more light it blocks. But measuring the planet's mass involved tracking the motion of the star itself. Depending on its mass, a planet can exert a gravitational tug on its star. This stellar motion can be detected as a very slight wobble, known as a Doppler shift. The results suggest Kepler 78b is about 1.2 times the size of Earth, and 1.7 times as massive. From the same measurements, the astronomers calculated the planet's density as 5.3 grams per cubic centimetre, close to the 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre value for Earth. These results provide strong evidence for Kepler 78b's rocky composition. Dr Winn said the fact that two independent teams of scientists came to similar conclusions about the alien world added confidence to the measurement. Kepler-78b is probably a doomed world, researchers explained. Gravitational tides are expected to draw it ever closer to its star. Eventually it will move so close that the star's gravity will rip the planet apart, vanishing within three billion years. Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <title>Dark matter hunt nears final phase</title>
      <description>The first results from a particle detector called LUX suggest that the hunt for dark matter could be entering its final stages.</description>

      <body>Scientists could be nearing the final phase of the search for dark matter: the enigmatic substance thought to make up a quarter of our Universe. The first results from a particle detector called LUX show it is the most powerful experiment of its kind. It did not detect any dark matter during its first run, but scientists say it is poised to probe deeper than ever before during its second in 2014. It has also ruled out earlier hints of dark matter shown by other experiments. Dr Chamkaur Ghag, a collaborator on the LUX experiment from University College London, said: "If the dark matter is out there and if it interacts the way we think it does we should really start seeing it now." Not finding any direct evidence for dark matter particles would mean that physicists would have to "go back to the drawing board", he added. Missing matter Dark matter is thought to make up 27% of the Universe. But astronomers have only been able to infer its existence through the gravitational effects it has on visible matter in the Universe; no-one has ever directly detected it. Most scientists believe that it takes the form of particles called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, and that millions of these are streaming through us every second without a trace. There are three main ways that scientists are hunting for this elusive stuff. One is to look in deep space, using detectors such as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), to search for the debris that dark matter particles leave behind as they collide with each other. Another method is with the Large Hadron Collider, where scientists are hoping to create dark matter as they smash particles together. And the third is using detectors, installed underground, to try and detect the particles as they pass through the Earth. These experiments are set up to spot the very rare occasions when dark matter particles bump into regular matter. The LUX (Large Underground Xenon) detector is located deep in a mine in the Sanford Underground Research Facility, US. Its first 90-day run took place earlier this year. "What we've done in these first three months of operation is look at how well the detector is performing, and we're extremely pleased with what we're seeing," said Prof Richard Gaitskell, from Brown University in Rhode Island. "This first run demonstrates a sensitivity that is better than any previous experiment looking to detect dark matter particles directly." During this period, the detector did not see any evidence of dark matter. The team said that this absence also ruled out the possibility that other detectors, such as DAMA in Italy and the CDMS and CoGeNT experiments in the US, had seen glimpses of dark matter. The researchers said because LUX was so sensitive, if these hints had been correct, then it would have seen dark matter particles too. However, the scientists are hopeful that in the next 300-day run, which is scheduled to start in early 2014, LUX could be the first experiment to directly detect dark matter. "This really really should be it. I personally hope we will have detected WIMPs within this decade," said Dr Ghag. "We should know what a quarter of the Universe really is and LUX should be the one that finds it first." Commenting on the LUX results, Prof Carlos Frenk from Durham University said: "In the last decade, there have been claims by different groups from around the world who say they have cracked the problem - and some of them have not been received by the community with overwhelming confidence. But in the last few years these claims have really come thick and fast from some very good groups - from some of the best experimentalists in the world. "What LUX has done is brought some more order into the chaotic world of claims and counter claims. So when they say they rule out previous claims - one has to take them very seriously. But no doubt, more debate will ensue." He said he was hopeful that LUX might find evidence of dark matter. "I won't get the champagne out right now. But I will buy some and put it in the fridge." Prof Anne Green from the University of Nottingham added: "LUX is a big step forward in the field of WIMP direct detection. It's really impressive that they've achieved world leading sensitivity with their first, short data taking run. "LUX is complementary to indirect detection and collider experiments, such as AMS and the LHC. Because we don't know the exact properties of the WIMP, we don't know which type of experiment will see it first. And to be 100% sure we've detected dark matter we'll want to see consistent signals in different experiments." If LUX fails to conclusively find dark matter, the team has another chance with an even larger and more sensitive experiment: LUX-ZEPLIN. But if this cannot see any signs of the elusive particles, then it could be that physicists have got the concept of dark matter wrong and will have to come up with some new theories. </body>

      <title>Doping effects can last a decade</title>
      <description>Research in mice indicates that using steroids can have muscle building benefits for far longer than previously believed.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that athletes who use steroids for a short period can benefit for their entire careers. Experiments with mice showed that a brief exposure to testosterone allowed the mice to rapidly regain muscle later in their lives. The scientist behind the study says that if a similar effect can be shown in humans, it should lead to a lifetime ban for dopers. The research has been published in the Journal of Physiology. Norwegian scientists had previously published work that showed the existence of a "muscle memory". This suggested that if people exercised when they were young, their muscles grew more easily when they exercised later in life. The same team has now looked at the impact of a brief exposure to testosterone on mice. They found that three months after the drug was withdrawn, their muscles grew by 30% after six days of exercise. A control group of mice saw growth of just 6% in the same time period. "It is rare to have data that clear cut, I was pretty satisfied with that," Prof Kristian Gundersen, from the University of Oslo, told BBC News. He explained that the drugs boost the number of cell nuclei in the muscle fibres. These nuclei are key to building strength in muscles when people exercise and the mouse study suggests that these extra nuclei gained through using testosterone remain in the long term. Prof Gundersen believes the same holds true for humans. Despite the long held belief that steroid users lose the benefit of the drugs when they stop taking them, the Norwegian research suggests that even a brief exposure to steroids could have a long-lasting effect. "If it is sufficient to build muscle mass, I think it would be sufficient to give you this long term effect. I think it could last 10 years but I don't have the data to back that up. It would be my speculation yes," he said. The Norwegians believe that their research calls into question the current proposal from the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) to raise the penalty for dopers from two years to four. "In science if you cheat, you are out for life, and my personal view is that it should be similar for athletes," he said. "It is a harsh treatment but if you really are cheating, I think that's reasonable." The team has been given a grant from Wada to carry out further research on humans. They are developing the protocols for a study involving students at a sports college in Oslo. The research follows on from work that was carried out in Sweden in the past few years. Researchers found that power lifters who have stopped taking steroids had an advantage in their sport years after they stopped using the drugs. The researchers discovered that the lifters who had once taken the drugs had a comparable number of cell nuclei in their quadriceps as athletes who were currently performing high intensity training.

      <title>Insect-like drone is 'crash happy'</title>
      <description>Flying robot Gimball has been designed to bounce off objects to cope with chaotic environments after a disaster</description>

      <body>An insect-like flying rescue robot that can bounce off trees and buildings has been revealed by its creators. Gimball has been developed to be used in situations that are hazardous to humans. The robot is designed to be able to deal with crashes, and to right itself after a collision. Gimball has a protective spherical roll-cage, and is mounted on pivots to stay upright. The flying robot, which bounces off walls, moves in a similar way to a mosquito. Gimball was in part inspired by the way insects fly, co-creator Adrien Briod told the BBC. "Usually robots need to move around obstacles, so we thought it would be interesting to allow it to sustain collisions," Mr Briod said. The drone, described as "crash happy", was designed and built by a team in Switzerland at the Ecole Polytechnique Federerale de Lausanne (EPFL). The robot was developed for use in disaster situations, such as entering a building on fire, or after a radiation leak. Normally flying robots are taken out of action by a major collision, but the designers did not think the problem could be solved by adding more sensors. To keep Gimball lightweight, the research team decided to allow the robot to ricochet off obstacles instead. The robot has a rotating flexible frame that lets it bounce off anything that it hits in a chaotic environment. To stay upright, Gimball has a gyroscopic system that includes an accelerometer, the same type of sensor as used in smartphones to let the phone know which way is up. The battery-driven robot has two propellers, and is steered by fins. It is fitted with a motion sensor, a camera, an altimeter, a magnetic compass and a micro-controller processor. The 34cm (13 inch) , 370g (13oz) drone can lift weights of up to 30g, so can carry gas or radioactivity sensors, Mr Briod said. The robot can be remotely controlled, but Mr Briod aims to eventually incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities into Gimball to allow it to accomplish complex tasks by itself. The team that built Gimball at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL included Mr Briod and engineer Mariusz Kornatowski. </body>

      <title>IBM PC pioneer William C Lowe dies</title>

      <body>William C Lowe, who supervised the birth of IBM's first personal computer, has died aged 72 in Lake Forest, Illinois. The IBM Personal Computer, known as the 5150, was launched in August 1981, several years after Apple had brought its first computer to market. Mr Lowe was instrumental in driving IBM's PC project from conception to manufacture within the space of a year. Until then, IBM had been primarily known for large, mainframe computers. Aware that IBM needed to play catch-up in the nascent PC market, Mr Lowe bypassed the company's rather cumbersome proprietary development process and brought in components from outside to speed things up. The operating system, MS-DOS 1.0, was provided by a little-known technology company called Microsoft, while the 8088 microprocessor came from Intel. It cost $1,565 - about $4,000 (£2,500) in today's money - without a monitor and was IBM's first foray into the consumer market. Mr Lowe studied physics at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania, and joined IBM in 1962 as a product test engineer. In 1975, he became director of development and manufacturing operations for the company's General Systems Division. Three years later, as laboratory director of the division's Boca Raton site in Florida, he hatched the idea of IBM selling an own-branded computer targeted at small businesses and consumers. Mr Lowe originally suggested using Atari to help IBM gain quick entry to the market, but this idea was rejected. Instead, management gave the go-ahead for him to develop a prototype made from off-the-shelf components. He assembled a team of 12 engineers to work on the Acorn Project (not to be confused with the UK's Acorn Computers) under the direction of Don Estridge. Part of the testing involved the computer's ability to run the Pac-Man game. "We didn't just design a computer; we created an industry," said Patty McHugh, Acorn project team member responsible for designing the PC's motherboard. The rest, as they say, is history. More than 250,000 IBM PCs were sold in the first year after its launch. As a reward for his efforts, Bill Lowe was promoted to vice president of the Information Systems Division and general manager of IBM's facility in Rochester, Minnesota. But the IBM PC was not, technically, the very first personal computer the company made. In 1973, IBM's General Systems Division produced a prototype called "Special computer, APL machine portable" (Scamp), also made from off-the-shelf materials and components. Scamp could be used as a desktop calculator and interactive programming device and led to the development of the IBM 5100 two years later. But the IBM PC was the first machine designed specifically for the mass market. The IBM PC project had highlighted the benefits of collaboration, and in 1985, IBM and Microsoft agreed to develop software together that could also run on other machines. But while Mr Lowe believed in the "open architecture" concept, it opened the back door to rival manufacturers who could build IBM-compatible machines more cheaply. It seemed to some that the approach had backfired, as IBM faced increasingly tough competition in the PC and software markets. Mr Lowe took a lot of the blame and this may have contributed to his decision to leave IBM in 1988 to join Xerox, the photocopier specialist, then looking to expand into other product areas. In 1991, he became president of corporate jet maker, Gulfstream. Mr Lowe died on 19 October 2013 from a heart attack. </body>

      <title>Elephant cull effects 'last decades'</title>
      <description>African elephant society remains disrupted by culling operations that took place decades ago, research reveals.</description>

      <body>African elephants' decision-making abilities are left impaired by culling operations that ended decades ago, University of Sussex research suggests. A study found that elephant herds that lost adults to culls during the 1970s and 1980s were less able to respond appropriately to other elephant calls. Lead researcher Prof Karen McComb said the animals' "social understanding" had been impaired by the loss of adults. The results are published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology. The scientists, from the University of Sussex, say this is the first "systematic evidence that fundamental social skills may be significantly impaired by man-made disruption". To study this, the researchers compared the behaviour of two herds of elephants: those in the Amboseli National Park, in Kenya, which have been relatively undisturbed by culling operations and a population in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. The herd at Pilanesberg was made up of young orphaned elephants introduced during the early 1980s and 1990s, after management culls of adult and older juvenile animals in the Kruger National Park. There is already evidence that the loss of these adult elephants had dramatic social consequences on South Africa's elephants; the researchers describe these effects as akin to post traumatic stress disorder. In two protected areas in South Africa, Prof McComb told BBC News, "young, orphaned male elephants became hyper-aggressive and attacked and killed rhinoceroses". Dr Graeme Shannon, who led this study, used sound to test the animals' social understanding - playing recordings of other elephants calls to monitor their response. When Amboseli elephants heard the call of an unfamiliar elephant, they reacted in a defensive way - bunching together and moving towards the sound. This, Prof McComb explained is an appropriate response. "It's what elephants should do when faced with a genuine stranger," she said. Equally appropriately, Amboseli elephants "remain relaxed when faced with the calls of more familiar animals". In Pilanesberg, by contrast, the elephants' reactions were "completely random". "There was no pattern at all to their responses," Prof McComb told BBC News, suggesting that these elephants could not tell the difference between friend and foe. "This really suggests that the breakdown in their social fabric, even though it occurred decades ago, has had a real effect on their decision-making processes," she added. "Their social understanding has been impaired." Their second playback experiment reinforced this conclusion, revealing that the Pilanesberg elephants did not distinguish between the call of a mature, dominant elephant and that of a much less threatening youngster. African elephants can live for up to 70 years and form close-knit groups that are dominated by a matriarch. So the researchers say that the loss of experienced adults can have long-term negative consequences on a herd. This, they add, is "the first direct evidence" that these important social abilities in elephants are "severely compromised" in animals that had been separated from family members decades before. Richard Byrne, professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews, said this was a "very important piece of work". He told BBC News: "By probing directly into the social knowledge of elephants years after translocations shows that the long-term unfortunate effects have indeed not been underestimated. "I hope the results will be taken into account in any further plans to cull locally 'unwanted' elephants." </body>

      <title>Falling trend in CO2 emissions</title>
      <description>New research suggests that the rate of global emissions of CO2 may be slowing down, despite economic growth.</description>

      <body>Global emissions of carbon dioxide may be showing the first signs of a "permanent slowdown" in the rate of increase. According to a new report, emissions in 2012 increased at less than half the average over the past decade. Key factors included the shift to shale gas for energy in the US while China increased its use of hydropower by 23%. However the use of cheap coal continues to be an issue, with UK consumption up by almost a quarter. The report on trends in global emissions has been produced annually by the Netherlands Environment Assessment Agency and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. It finds that emissions of carbon dioxide reached a new record in 2012 of 34.5bn tonnes. But the rate of increase in CO2 was 1.4%, despite the global economy growing by 3.5%. This decoupling of emissions from economic growth is said to be down to the use of less fossil fuels, more renewable energy and increased energy savings. The main emitters, accounting for 55% of the global total, were China, the US and the European Union. All three saw changes that were described as "remarkable" by the report's authors. Emissions from China increased by 3% but this was a significant slowdown compared to annual increases of around 10% over the past decade. There were two important factors in reducing China's CO2. The first was the ending of a large economic stimulus package. As a result electricity and energy prices increased at half the rate of GDP. "They want to grow economically less fast," one of the authors, Dr Greet Maenhout, told BBC News. "It is like a tiger that you have to keep under control, and you can also see in the CO2 trends, the growth is not so big." China also achieved exceptional growth in the use of hydropower for the generation of electricity, increasing capacity and output by 23% in 2012. This alone had the effect of curbing the country's emissions by 1.5%. In the US, the shale revolution continues to make waves. Overall emissions were down by 4% in the year mainly because of a continuing shift from coal to gas in the generation of electricity. Shale is now responsible for one third of US gas production and almost one quarter of total oil production. "It is amazing, shale gas has been growing since 2007/8, I think it will continue but that is speculation," said Dr Maenhout. "I think there is an economic benefit to further expansion, I am not expecting it to go down." The other major decline came in the European Union where economic recession in the 27 nation bloc saw emissions decline by 1.3%. This was down to a decrease in energy consumption of oil and gas, with a 4% decline in road transport. Renewable energy also continued its upward trend, at accelerating speed. It took 15 years for the renewable global share to increase 0.5% to 1.1% - but it took only six years for it to double again, to 2.4% in 2012. Looking ahead, the report suggests that if the push for shale continues in the US, if China sticks to its published plans and if renewables continue to grow - particularly in Europe - global emissions might slow down permanently. "It is good news but still not sufficient," said Dr Maenhout. "We are still having increases every year which are cumulative. Since CO2 lives for 100 years in the atmosphere, we will still not be able to cope with a 2C target for 2050." The report was welcomed by green activist Bill McKibben, who is campaigning for a divestment from fossil fuel stocks and shares. "It is good news but nowhere near good enough," he told BBC News. "The solution we need here is dictated by physics, and at the moment the physics is busy melting the Arctic and acidifying the ocean. "We can't just plateau or go up less, we have to very quickly try and get the planet off fossil fuels." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>The golden eagle has topped the vote in a campaign to find Scotland's favourite wild animal. The bird of prey was competing against the red deer, red squirrel, harbour seal and otter. The campaign was run jointly by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and VisitScotland as part of the Year of Natural Scotland 2013 celebrations. Thousands of votes were recorded online following the campaign launch in spring this year. Voting closed on Thursday. The golden eagle received 4,773 of the 12,417 votes cast. The red squirrel was second with 2,523, the red deer 1,819, otter 1,794 and harbour seal 725. Other animals received 783 votes, with the top three being wildcat, pine marten and puffin. Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "While we can be enormously proud of all our native wildlife, it is fitting that the magnificent golden eagle has topped this poll of Scotland's Big 5 species. "At present Scotland is home to all of the UK's breeding pairs of golden eagles, and the species has done well to recover after almost being wiped out in the last two centuries. "However, recent incidents have shown that the golden eagle is still threatened by illegal persecution in some areas. We have a responsibility to protect this wonderful bird so that future generations can continue to enjoy its presence in our skies." Scotland's Big 5 were selected because they were all high profile species, widely associated with Scotland, and with a broad geographical spread. Ian Jardine, SNH chief executive, said: "The response to the campaign has been brilliant. Thousands of people have voted for their favourite from Scotland's Big 5 list. "There have been several alternative lists put forward for seabirds, game animals, trees and plants, and support for rarer species like the pine marten and wildcat. "It has got people thinking about and talking about wildlife, and showing how much affection and pride people have, not just for the five species on the list, but for Scottish wildlife generally." Through the partnership with SNH, VisitScotland promoted the campaign to millions of potential visitors. The campaign explained where best to see the animals in their natural environments. This saw all of Scotland's Big 5 championed through a series of billboard advertisements in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh and extensive radio and online advertising. Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, added: "We've been absolutely delighted with the response that Scotland's Big 5 campaign has received, and it has been a cornerstone of our celebrations for the Year of Natural Scotland 2013. "One of the key pillars of the year was to get as many people here at home out seeing parts of Scotland that they may not have been to before, and the Big 5 campaign has given us a fantastic opportunity to promote even the most remote areas of our wonderful country." </body>

      <body>A team of researchers says it has identified a new species of humpback dolphin. Physical and genetic evidence suggests that cetaceans found in waters off northern Australia are distinct within the humpback family. This general group grows up to 2.4m in length and inhabits coastal waters from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The evidence for the distinct species in northern Australia is outlined in the academic journal Molecular Ecology. "Based on the findings of our combined morphological and genetic analyses, we can suggest that the humpback dolphin genus includes at least four member species," said co-author Martin Mendez, from the Wildlife Conservation Society's Latin America and the Caribbean programme. Dr Mendez added: "This discovery helps our understanding of the evolutionary history of this group and informs conservation policies to help safeguard each of the species." The authors analysed physical data gathered mostly from beached dolphins and museum specimens. Specifically, the team examined features from 180 skulls covering most of the distribution area of the group in order to compare features across the region. The researchers also collected 235 tissue samples from humpback dolphins, stretching from the eastern Atlantic to the western Pacific Oceans, analysing both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to study variation. Dr Nicholas Higgs, a marine biologist from Plymouth University, told BBC News: "It is an interesting and significant finding and has important conservation implications, namely that the Australian population is a distinct species and should be given conservation status on its own. He added: "We knew that there were humpback dolphins living off Australia, but didn't realise that they were a separate species from that living in the rest of South-East Asia."

      <title>Bat virus clues to origins of Sars</title>
      <description>The discovery of Sars-like viruses in horseshoe bats could point to the origins of the human pathogen, researchers say.</description>

      <body>Researchers have found strong evidence that the Sars virus originated in bats. Two novel Sars-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats which are closely related to the pathogen that infects humans. Critically, the viruses infect human cells in the same way, binding to a receptor called ACE2. This suggests coronaviruses could transfer directly from bats to humans, rather than via an intermediate species like civets as was previously thought. The results are reported in the journal Nature. According to Gary Crameri, virologist at CSIRO and an author on the paper, this research "is the key to resolving the continued speculation around bats as the origin of the Sars outbreaks". This Sars-like coronavirus is around 95% genetically similar to the Sars virus in humans, the research shows. And they say it could be used to develop new vaccines and drugs to combat the pathogen. The Sars outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003 resulted in more than 8,000 worldwide cases and more than 770 deaths. This, along with the ongoing endemic of the Mers-coronavirus demonstrates the threat to humans from novel coronaviruses. Dr Peter Daszak is the president of the EcoHealth Alliance and an author on the paper published in Nature. He said: "Coronaviruses evolve very rapidly. The ones we are seeing are exquisitely evolved to jump from one species to another, which is quite unusual for a virus. So the big question is why are they emerging now?" At wildlife markets in China other animals and humans come into close proximity with bats, creating an ideal environment for the virus to jump between species. Also, those hunting in or living near bat caves have a significant risk of infection from such viruses, which are excreted in bat faeces. Understanding the origins of infectious diseases like Sars could help scientists tackle future infectious viruses before they emerge, through knowing where they are likely to arise and which families of virus we are most vulnerable to, and taking action to prevent initial infection. Dr Daszak said it would cost "about $1.5bn to discover all the viruses in mammals. I think that would be a great investment because once you have done it, you can develop vaccines and get ready with test kits to find the first stage of emergence and stop it." </body>

      <title>Japan sea species 'face extinction'</title>
      <description>Japanese hunting of dolphins, smaller whales and porpoises is threatening some species with extinction, an environmental group says.</description>

      <body>Japan's hunting of dolphins, smaller whales and porpoises is threatening some species with extinction in its coastal waters, a report by a British environmental group has said. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) report says that more than a million such creatures have been killed in Japanese hunts in the past 70 years. It says that each year thousands are killed despite conservation concerns. The Japanese government has not commented on the report. But it has consistently defended its coastal whaling as a longstanding tradition, a source of livelihood and necessary for scientific research. The government has also argued that small cetaceans should be excluded from the International Convention on Whaling. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says that the Japanese practice of driving many dolphins and porpoises onto beaches to be slaughtered has drawn international condemnation. The EIA says that it is also unsustainable, and a danger to human health. Studies have found high levels of mercury and industrial chemicals like PCBs in dolphin and porpoise meat. One study found people living in one dolphin-eating community in central Japan have mercury levels five times higher than normal. "A comprehensive analysis of the available scientific data demonstrates unequivocally that there are grave concerns regarding the sustainability of these hunts," the EIA report says. It goes on to accuse the government of "displaying a lack of responsibility" in ensuring the sustainability of small cetacean populations in Japanese waters - warning that its annual quota of 16,000 dolphins is far too high. The EIA says that the quota is based on 20-year-old data and that dolphin populations are much lower now. The conservation status of each species varies, the report says, depending on its range and hunting practices. Catch limits for Dall's porpoises are 4.7-4.8 times higher than the safe threshold, it claims. For the striped dolphin, once the mainstay of the industry but now endangered and disappearing from some areas, catches have dropped from more than 1,800 in the 1980s to about 100 today. Our correspondent says that anyone who has seen the documentary The Cove will know how controversial Japan's annual dolphin hunt can be. Hundreds of animals are driven into a bay where men jump into the water and cut their throats, turning the sea red. </body>

      <body>Two orphaned otter cubs are being cared for by the Scottish SPCA after being found in distress at Thurso beach in Caithness. The 10-week-old males were spotted by a member of the public. They were scared off by two dogs and were eventually found hiding under a wheelie bin in a nearby garden. Scottish SPCA senior inspector Audrey Gunn managed to trap the pair. They are receiving care at the charity's rescue centre in Clackmannanshire. The cubs, found on 26 October, have been named Thurso and Surf. Ms Gunn said: "Thurso and Surf were timid but curious and I paid a visit to the local fish shop to make sure they were well fed. "They were lucky to be found as otters are dependant on their mothers until they're around a year old and they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own." National Wildlife Rescue Centre manager Colin Seddon added: "Both cubs are well, albeit very frightened. However, they are clearly very happy to be together and they follow each other everywhere." </body>

      <body>Hedgehogs which have been nursed back to health are being fitted with GPS "backpacks" to find out how they go on to survive in the wild. The 24 hedgehogs, cared for at Shepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire, will have their movements tracked. The animals will be released in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire on Wednesday. Rebecca Willers, chairwoman of Shepreth Wildlife Conservation Charity, hopes the study can eventually boost survival rates of rehabilitated hedgehogs. The £150 devices weigh just over 1.8oz (50g) and have been designed for the project by Dr David Wallis of Ecometry Technologies. An inch-square section of spines will be clipped on each creature's back with the battery-powered backpacks then glued on. This will take place as the hedgehog is coming around from an anaesthetic, which will be administered so the charity's vet can give them a health check. The tracking device, which uses satellite positioning, will be monitored on a computer. It will fall off when the animal naturally sheds its spikes in a few months. Miss Willers hopes the pioneering study will run for a number of years if funding can be found. "The over-arching aim is to see if hedgehogs survive in the wild after rehabilitation in what is a plastic environment," she said. "But the most important aspect is to find out if hedgehogs go on to reproduce and if rehabilitation is helping the hedgehog population as a whole. "In 10 years we want to have a comprehensive guide of the best release sites and methods." The animals are being set free at both rural and urban sites in Shepreth on the Hertfordshire/Cambridgeshire border, Ely in Cambridgeshire and West Stow and Beck Row in Suffolk. This year researchers hope to discover if captive hedgehogs revert to their natural behaviour once released. "The point of this study is to find the best release weights for hibernation and to discover if they are actually going to go into hibernation," said Miss Willers. Pre-release pens have been set up at the park and are housing the hedgehogs as they get used to living outside. "We wouldn't be releasing animals if they were not at optimum fitness," said Miss Willers. "Nothing is being put at risk." Before the study was finalised, the hedgehogs were put under 24-hour surveillance for two weeks to see if the GPS packs caused any ill-effects. Volunteers have also been assigned to each location and if an animal stops moving they will investigate. The £9,500 cost of the research has been funded by the British Hedgehog Preservation Society. A report published in 2011 said hedgehog numbers were believed to have fallen by a quarter in a decade. </body>

      <body>Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood, in a study published in the journal Current Biology. Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish.

      <body>Scientists from the University of Manchester have created a "digital robot" of the biggest dinosaur ever to have walked the Earth - Argentinosaurus. This animated sauropod has shown the researchers how these creatures would have walked, showing that supporting their 80 tonne weight would have stretched muscle and bone to the limits of its capabilities. The team used a laser scan of the dinosaur's skeleton and mapped onto that its tendons and bones. Here, Dr Bill Sellers, who led the study, describes how the model was able to "learn how to walk".

Even disturbing their nests is a criminal offence. The raptor is not considered to be under threat but scientists are worried about a recent increase in the number of golden eagles killed by wind turbines. Eagles in flight tend to focus on the ground below as they look for prey, unaware of the fast-spinning blades in their paths until it's too late. The wind energy industry says such deaths account for a tiny percentage of human-caused deaths of eagles. It says it is working with the government to help protect birds.

The biggest of the sauropods, including the famous diplodocus, weighed up to 80 tonnes. Professor Kent Stevens from the University of Oregon has used digital skeleton simulations to resolve the question of whether sauropods held their heads high or out to the front with their incredibly long necks. He told BBC News that if you "let the bones tell the story," it is clear that these giants would not have the flexibility in their necks to pull them high above their heads. Instead, as this simulation reveals, the sauropod Apatosaurus (formerly and perhaps more famously known as Brontosaurus) could place its head at any point across an "enormous feeding surface". The collection of papers on "Sauropod gigantism" is published in the journal PLoS One. Simulation courtesy of Kent A Stevens, University of Oregon </body>

      <description>What a mission to Mars means for India</description>

      <body>India's launch of a small unmanned satellite to Mars is being described as a giant leap for its space programme. Science writer Pallava Bagla writes on what the mission means for India and the world. If all goes well and the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the United States, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. India's 1,350kg (2,976lb) robotic satellite which is undertaking the 10-month-long, over 200-million-kilometre journey to Mars is equipped with five instruments. They include a sensor to track methane or marsh gas - a possible sign of life - on Mars, a colour camera for taking pictures, and a thermal imaging spectrometer to map the surface and mineral wealth of the planet. The mission will also analyse the thin Martian atmosphere. After India's successful unmanned Chandrayaan mission to the Moon in 2008 that brought back the first clinching evidence of the presence of water there, the Mars mission, according to K Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), is a "natural progression". More than 500 scientists from the Bangalore-based Isro worked round the clock on this $73m (£45m) mission, which was announced by PM Manmohan Singh in August last year. Project chief Subbiah Arunan says he has not taken a vacation in the last 15 months, sleeping at Isro's satellite centre in Bangalore and going home for "about one or two hours every day". So does India's Mars mission mark the beginning of a new Asian space race? India sees the Mars mission as an opportunity to beat its regional rival China in reaching the planet, especially after a Russian mission carrying the first Chinese satellite to Mars failed in November 2011. Japan also failed in a similar effort in 1998. China has beaten India in space in almost every aspect so far: it has rockets that can lift four times more weight than India's, and in 2003, successfully launched its first human space flight which India has not yet embarked on. China launched its maiden mission to the Moon in 2007, ahead of India. So if India's mission succeeds, it will have something to feel proud about. "National pride is important. If the Mars mission succeeds, it will be a big morale booster for India. We are not in a space race," says SK Shivakumar, director of Isro's Bangalore-based satellite centre. The risks can be high in a space race. Since 1960 about 40 missions to Mars have been launched, more than half of which have failed. And no nation - apart from Mars Express, Europe's maiden venture to Mars representing 20 countries - has succeeded in its maiden venture. Though India says its Mars mission is the cheapest inter-planetary mission ever to have been undertaken in half a century of space exploration, some are questioning its scientific purpose. "This is a highly suboptimal mission with limited scientific objectives," says D Raghunandan of Delhi Science Forum, a think tank. Others like economist-activist Jean Dreze have said the mission "seems to be part of the Indian elite's delusional quest for superpower status". Rejecting such talk, a top government official says: "We have heard these arguments since the 1960s, about India being a poor country not needing or affording a space programme. "If we can't dare to dream big it would leave us as hewers of wood and drawers of water! India is today too big to be just living on the fringes of high technology."

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24765783</url>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <body>India is preparing to send a robotic spacecraft into orbit around Mars - a first for the country. Yogita Limaye from the BBC's India Business Report spoke to K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) - the country's space agency - about his hopes for the mission. A: Essentially in this Mars mission, which we are planning, the prime objective is to demonstrate India's capability to capture the Martian orbit and then to conduct a few meaningful scientific experiments. A: See, essentially when we talk about Mars and exploration of Mars, you look at life as one of those goals. So (we look for) the presence of methane in the Martian environment and see whether this methane, if it is there, has a biological origin or a geological origin. We also would like to study the Martian atmosphere and the escape processes there. A: No, see Curiosity is measuring the presence of methane in a small area where it is there today. We are talking about the entire Martian environment. So Curiosity saying "no" is not a point to be worried about. A: Any mission to Mars has to be done in an opportune window and the imminent window is November 2013, that is we need to get out of this sphere of influence of earth by 30 November to ensure that we have the minimum distance between Earth and Mars. Now we are launching this Mars orbiter from Sriharikota in the east coast of India in the first week of November and then the PSLV-XL (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) is used for the launch which will put this orbiter into an elliptical orbit around the Earth... then around the last week of November, we have a crucial operation, it's called the "trans-Martian injection" where the spacecraft is directed towards Mars. Then it is a long voyage of 300 days where the orbiter spacecraft passes through the sphere of influence of the Earth... Then it goes through a long phase of heliocentric flight where the orbiter spacecraft will be influenced not only by the Sun but by the other planets too. Then as it approaches Mars... we have another major action: capturing the orbit of Mars, which is on 21st of September 2014. A: Soon after the orbiter is put into the orbit of Mars, we would start the experimentation and even before this orbiter reaches the Martian environment we would be calibrating these instruments as it travels from Earth to Mars. But the most important part of it is looking at the distances involved. It takes at least 20 minutes for any signal to come from the Mars orbiter to Earth in some phases. It could be anything between four to 20 minutes one-way. A: Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: "it is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society." And in this area, India has become a role model for the whole world. Let me talk in terms of numbers. We spend in India about a billion dollars for the space programme. If we look at the central government expenditure, we spend 0.34% of its budget for the space programme. This goes primarily for building satellites in communications and remote sensing and navigation for space applications. Nearly 35% of it goes on launch vehicle development and about 7-8% goes on the science and exploration programme. So the Mars mission we're talking about today is part of that 8% of the 0.34% of Indian central government expenditure. And if you look at the benefit that the country has accrued over the years, it has surpassed the money that has been spent in terms of tangible and intangible benefits. [This can be expressed in terms of] the advantage that the people have got, the fishermen have got, the farmers have got, the government bodies have got for informed decision-making, the support the country has got for disaster management and by providing a communication infrastructure for this country using the INSAT satellites. Today we have nearly 10 communication satellites and 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. This is a great revolution that has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme. A: See, Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter, but Chandrayaan-2 as you said looks at the surface of the Moon using a rover and a landing module there. In 2009-2010, we planned this as a joint mission where India was to provide the launch and the orbiter and Russia was to provide the lander and the rover. Over these years there has been a programmatic realignment on this and, as of now, the plan is that the rover will be made by India and the lander will also be developed by India, and we must have this lander developed by the year 2016. Now, we also require a reliable GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket) for launching Chandrayaan-2. In December 2013, we are going to launch the GSLV T5 rocket with our own cryogenic engine stage. If that is successful, and we are able to have one more successful flight of the GSLV, then we would be ready - from the launch angle - for Chandrayaan-2. So, this is the scenario emerging and there will be scientific experiments in the lander module and in the rover, and a few in the orbiter too. Yes, 2016 is the correct target and the limiting factor for that is the development of the lander module. A: See, as of now we have no declared programme on human space flight, but in the year 2006-07 we began a study... and as of now we have taken up the critical new technologies that India needs to master a human space flight. The core module development, environment control and life support systems, the crew escape system, these are all part of that and we are working on it at the moment. But we require a human-rated vehicle that is capable of taking the crew module into a lower orbit. So you need to have a reliable GSLV for a manned mission or a GSLV Mark 3 developed and then manned-rated. A: As of now, there is no timeline for a mission but we are working on the development of the critical technologies required for it. A: Let me first say each country has its own priorities and focus. Right from the beginning, right from the early sixties, India's focus has been on peaceful uses of outer space and space applications and there India is today a role model for the whole world. One can be proud of it. China has its own priorities and it is moving in that direction. So, we are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services. We need to do it more cost-effectively and deliver it to the target audience in the country, whether it is to the people or the government or other agencies in the country. So that has been the focus of the Indian space programme. This interview has been abridged for reasons of article length. </body>

      <title>Thorium backed as a 'future fuel'</title>
      <description>Could thorium usher in a new era of nuclear power?</description>

      <body>Nuclear scientists are being urged by the former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix to develop thorium as a new fuel. Mr Blix says that the radioactive element may prove much safer in reactors than uranium. It is also more difficult to use thorium for the production of nuclear weapons. His comments will add to growing levels of interest in thorium, but critics warn that developing new reactors could waste public funds. Mr Blix, the former Swedish foreign minister, told BBC News: "I’m a lawyer not a scientist but in my opinion we should be trying our best to develop the use of thorium. I realise there are many obstacles to be overcome but the benefits would be great. "I am told that thorium will be safer in reactors - and it is almost impossible to make a bomb out of thorium. These are very major factors as the world looks for future energy supplies." His enthusiasm is shared by some in the British nuclear establishment. Scientists at the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) have been encouraged by the government to help research on an Indian thorium-based reactor, and on a test programme in Norway. The Norway tests at the OECD’s nuclear trials facility in Halden are conducted in a Bond-style underground bunker. A couple of charming Nordic homes perch on top of a hill at the edge of the town. Below them a garage door in a cliff face leads into a tunnel deep into the hill where the reactor hall lies. In theory, at least, the mountain protects the town from an accident. The thorium tests are being carried out by a private firm, Thor Energy (the element itself was discovered in Norway in 1828 and named after the Norse god of thunder). The company hopes to get thorium licensed alongside uranium in current water-cooled reactor plants. The British government says it would be useful to increase the fuel options for nuclear operators, as thorium is believed to be three times more plentiful than uranium. It is also currently being produced as a by-product from mining rare earths. Staff from NNL have been advising Thor on the use of mixed oxide fuels (MOX). NNL has also been helping the Indian authorities develop a thorium reactor, as India sits on top of the world’s biggest thorium reserves. The Thor project represents an evolutionary approach, using thorium in existing reactors together with uranium or plutonium. Oystein Asphjell, chief executive of Thor Energy told BBC News: "There is lots of thorium in the world, very well distributed all over the globe. In operations, in a reactor, it has some chemical and physical properties that make it really superior to uranium as well. On the waste side, we don’t generate long lived waste." China is going for a revolutionary approach, devising a next-generation reactor which its supporters say will enable thorium to be used much more safely than uranium. When a uranium reactor overheats and the fuel rods can’t contain the chain reaction, as happened at Fukushima, the crisis continues. If something happened to a thorium reactor, technicians could simply switch off the stimulus which comes from uranium or plutonium in a small feeder plant and the thorium reaction would halt itself. Prof Carlo Rubbia from Cern previously told BBC News: "Thorium will be able to shut itself off without any human intervention... You just switch off the beam.” "There are also no long-lived waste products... We estimate that after something like 400-500 years all the radioactivity will be dissipated away." These advantages, if they were realised, would be huge. But thorium still has many technical problems to overcome. What is more, countless billions have been ploughed into uranium-based research and development, and in the words of Mr Blix, uranium has a very deep furrow, backed by vested interests. Canada, China, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the UK and the US have experimented with thorium as a substitute fuel in the past. Questions are being raised, though, about the advisability of pinning the world’s energy ambitions on another nuclear dream. Environmentalists often allege that if renewable power had commanded a fraction as much research funding as nuclear it would already be much cheaper and more common. Dr Nils Bohmer, a nuclear physicist working for a Norwegian environmental NGO, Bellona, said developing thorium was a costly distraction from the need to cut emissions immediately to stave off the prospect of dangerous climate change. "The advantages of thorium are purely theoretical," he told BBC News. "The technology development is decades in the future. Instead I think we should focus on developing renewable technology - for example offshore wind technology - which I think has a huge potential to develop.” If thorium ever makes it as a commercial nuclear fuel, uranium may be seen as a massive and costly diversion. Some supporters of thorium believe that it was bypassed in the past because governments wanted the plutonium from certain conventional reactors to make atomic bombs. They believe thorium was rejected because it was simply too safe. Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <body>In an era of giants, sauropods dwarfed everything. These dinoasurs, including the diplodocus, were the biggest to walk the Earth. T. rex would have nipped at the knees of the largest sauropod - Argentinosaurus huinculensis. University of Manchester researchers have now made a digital Argentinosaurus robot to work out how this 80-tonne monster would have moved its vast bulk. The study is published in an issue of PLoS One on "sauropod gigantism". The immense size of sauropods - the long-necked, tree-trunk-legged storybook giants of the Jurassic period - presents a quandary for biologists because they push animal bones and muscles to their limit. This is why researchers have set out to answer some of the big questions about these very big animals, including: How did their muscles and bones support and move their bodies? How did their digestive system process sufficient food? And how high could they have reached with their immensely long necks (much longer, proportionally, than a giraffe's)? "The biggest elephants weigh around six or seven tonnes," said Dr Bill Sellers, of the University of Manchester, who led the digital robot study. "So Argentinosaurus was at least 10 times bigger than the biggest elephant. "As you get bigger your weight goes up by the cube of your height, but the force your muscles can generate only goes up by the square, so your strength-to-weight ratio gets much worse." As with many dinosaurs, the reconstructions of this giant are based on a relatively limited fossilised jigsaw. For Argentinosaurus, only its legs and part of its spine have been unearthed. So controversy has raged over whether it was possible for an animal to be so huge and heavy and still able to walk on land. "Whenever anyone finds a dinosaur, they want it to be the biggest, meanest dinosaur ever, so there might be a temptation to make a reconstruction a bit bigger than it was," Dr Sellers told BBC News. "We wanted to test whether it was a reasonable reconstruction for an animal." To make the digital dinosaur, Dr Sellers and his colleagues scanned a reconstructed skeleton housed at the Carmen Funes municipal museum in Argentina. They were able to map muscles and tendons on to the skeleton using the anatomy of modern animals, including reptiles and birds, as a guide. Then came the difficult part - their digital dinosaur had to learn to walk. This, Dr Sellers said, required a technique called "machine learning". "The animal needs to learn how to move the best way it can using the muscles and skeleton we've given it," he said. This took a huge amount of computer processing power, as the simulated dinosaur robot took the information programmed into its virtual muscles and worked out how to use them to walk. The resulting steady march of this digital dinosaur revealed that, to keep its body steady, the movement at its joints had to be very restricted. "This animal is so big that it's right at the limit of what you could cope with as an animal that lives on land," said Dr Sellers. "So things like getting up off the ground would have been extraordinarily difficult if not impossible." Something else these beasts would not have been capable of, according to Prof Kent Stevens, of the University of Oregon, would be adopting the storybook pose of holding their heads aloft. He says that while "soaring necks is congruous with childhood expectations, the bones tell a different story". For his study, Prof Stevens also created virtual dinosaurs - digitally reconstructing the skeleton of Apatosaurus (better known in the past as brontosaurus). Dr Stevens said: " [If we] put sauropod neck vertebrae back together with the proper separations, and they form a very straight line." He says the bones simply do not have the curves seen in giraffes' or some birds' necks. A natural J-curve in a giraffe's vertebrae direct its neck upwards at a steep angle. A vertebral S-curve gives a swan its shapely neck. But while Prof Stevens' less soaring reconstructions of these dinosaurs might puncture childhood myths, his digital dinosaurs were still capable of impressive feats, thanks to their huge size. As his animations reveal, by sweeping its outstretched neck, Apatosaurus would have explored, and devoured food, over a huge space. "While none were very flexible, sauropods could sweep out broad areas - in some cases 10 or so metres above the ground," Prof Stevens said. All this sweeping and devouring provided a digestive challenge for these huge herbivores. And Dr Marcus Clauss, of the Clinic for Zoo Animals at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, set out to find out how their digestive systems coped. Just as Dr Sellers found that normal bones and muscles could carry 80 tonnes of bulk, it seems there was also nothing unusual about the sauropod gut. "A normal gut can work for any size of body," said Dr Clauss. "A mouse can get enough energy for its size, and an elephant can. The main thing is that [the elephant] eats much more." One key factor that seems to have allowed sauropods to become so gigantic is that they would swallow their food without chewing. As this unchewed food would spend so much time passing through extremely long intestines, it would have ample time to break down. "If you spend so much time chewing, you're limited in the amount of food you can take in," Dr Clauss said. "So one of the conditions for an animal to become that large is that it must not chew." The secret to just how massive these creatures were could be contained in their ancient fossilised trackways. Dr Tom Schanz, of Ruhr University in Germany, has lent his engineering skills to the study of dinosaurs by developing a technique to estimate sauropod weight from a single footprint. He is an engineer who studies the properties of soil to work out exactly how buildings will settle and move on their foundations. Dr Schanz's new method incorporates this expertise. His laser scanning of preserved footprints could produce the most accurate measurements yet of what the dinosaurs weighed. To prove this, Dr Schanz's team took an elephant for a walk. The researchers studied every "dynamic component" of the walk - measuring the speed at which the elephant planted its feet, and how its weight was distributed in each step. "[Then we used the] laser scanning technique on the elephant footprints and back-calculated the weight," Dr Schanz said. The team was able to calculate the elephant's weight to within 10%. And since sauropods and elephants have such similar anatomy, the scientist says the same technique could be used to estimate the weight of the extinct dinosaurs. Building up an accurate picture of how these animals worked is revealing some of the most basic aspects of biology, including how bones and muscles work, and what the very limits are of their ability to function. "That's very important," Dr Sellers says, "because these things go wrong very commonly, and the better we understand them, the better our chances are of fixing them." </body>

      <description>Rare glimpse of one of the most sophisticated US spy planes</description>

      <body>The Global Hawk is one of the US military's most sophisticated spy planes and the BBC was able to get a rare view of one at Grand Forks Airbase in North Dakota. It can travel halfway round the world on a single tank of fuel and can track a man on the ground, even when the earth is covered by cloud, from a height of about 18,000m - that's close to 60,000ft. That means it could in theory peer into Syria to track chemical weapons while still flying in international airspace. Or keep track of North Korea's nuclear programme flying from the Pacific island of Guam. The man in charge of operations at Grand Forks, Colonel Lawrence Spinetta, says the Hawk "spans the globe on a daily basis, 24-7, providing some great intelligence for senior decision makers", though he won't be drawn on details. The use of drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft, as the US Military prefers to call them, is highly controversial, not least because of the clandestine killings carried out by armed CIA drones, such as the Reaper and Predator. Some Americans are worried about the way drones can be used to carry out surveillance at home; 17 US states have passed laws limiting their use. But North Dakota, which is sparsely populated and has wide-open empty spaces, appears more relaxed. The University of North Dakota is one of the first in the US to offer a degree course in how to operate drones. While the Global Hawk is not armed there is still a lot of secrecy surrounding its use. At Grand Forks airbase, there is still little sign that the US military is about to lift the lid. The crew of the United States Air Force (USAF) even remove their name badges to avoid identification. We were asked to leave any recording devices, cameras or phones behind as we were shown one of the "shelters" from which the Global Hawk is flown. Outside it looks like a shipping container. Inside, there are banks of screens, though for this visit they had all been switched off. The Operations Room, which oversees missions, is firmly out of bounds behind a heavy door with a secure entry code. We are, however, allowed to witness a pilot carry out a simulated mission from his desk. One of the pilots admits he misses what he calls the "seat-of-the-pants feeling" you get while in the air. He says "it's not as exciting as flying a manned aircraft", but adds that it is rewarding in other ways. The aircrew speak positively about being able to fly missions anywhere in the world without leaving the comforts of home or the family behind. That is perhaps one reason why a pilot can feel "a little detached", even if he or she is totally focused on the mission. But these unmanned aircraft are the future. The Nato alliance doesn't usually purchase its own military hardware but its members have clubbed together to buy five Global Hawks at a cost of $1.7bn (1.2bn euros). By 2017 they will be flying out of Sigonella in Sicily with the potential to cover maritime security as well as supporting troops on the ground. Those who manufacture drones are keen to highlight their utility beyond the battlefield. Bob Zeiser, who helps run the Global Hawk programme at Northrop Grumman, says the Global Hawk has been involved in helping out in the aftermath of natural disasters. In 2010, one flew over Haiti following a devastating earthquake, where it mapped the devastation and helped direct rescue efforts. It was able to conduct the mission from California and survey the entire country three times before returning to base. More recently, a Global Hawk was used to assess the damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. Mr Zeiser acknowledges there's still a challenge in winning around the public, but he says the negative perceptions can be overcome by showing the public that drones are safe to fly and that they are a good way of keeping people out of harm's way. But there are still plenty of questions as to how drones can be safely integrated into civilian airspace and how the rest of us feel about being watched by an unblinking eye in the sky. </body>

      <title>Flying car dream is becoming reality</title>
      <description>Why flying cars may finally be ready for launch</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635758</url>

      <body>In 1940 Henry Ford famously said: "Mark my word: A combination airplane and motorcar is coming. You may smile, but it will come." Just nine years later Moulton Taylor had designed and flown his Aerocar, proving the viability of Ford's fantastical concept. But only three models were ever built, and the dream of a viable vehicle that can offer freedom both in the air and on the road has remained frustratingly elusive. Until now that is. Technology - "sense and avoid" avionics, computer-aided design, and materials science - has advanced to such a degree that safety authorities are tantalisingly close to giving full approval to flying cars. "Since the Wright Brothers and Henry Ford we've had the dream of marrying the plane and the car," said Dick Knapinski, spokesman for the US Experimental Aircraft Association, "but engineering, regulatory and cultural hurdles have always got in the way. "Now we are really getting closer to making the dream come true." For example, in July this year, Boston-based company Terrafugia showed off its Transition "roadable aircraft" at the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) AirVenture event in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. "We have an experimental airworthiness certificate from the FAA [US Federal Aviation Authority] which means we still have to stay away from populated areas," said Richard Gersh, Terrafugia's vice-president of business development, "but everything is going to plan to achieve full certification." The Transition, whose wings fold up against the body of the carriage, is also licensed for testing on the road, but Mr Gersh emphasises its primary function is as an aircraft. "We don't envisage this replacing your family car, and you'll always have to take off and land at an airport," he said. "But it does give you the flexibility of driving to the airport and to your destination at the other end." When the Transition eventually goes on sale - which could be in two years, depending on how long full safety certification takes - it will retail for about $280,000 (£173,000), slightly cheaper than a Cessna Skyhawk fixed-wing plane. The company has already received more than 100 orders, said Mr Gersh. Les Dorr, FAA spokesman, told the BBC: "If a 'flying car' is intended to operate on US highways then the vehicle has to conform to both the applicable US Department of Transportation standards for a car and the applicable aviation standards for an aircraft. "Terrafugia is the only US aircraft certification project that has obtained an exemption or for which we've defined the certification requirements with both the FAA and NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]." Looking to the future, Terrafugia's concept craft - the TF-X - will incorporate vertical take-off and landing thanks to hinged propellers on the foldable wings combined with a rear propeller for forward propulsion. It will be a plug-in hybrid electric flying car promising a top speed of 200mph (320km/h) and a range of about 500 miles. The company envisages incorporating existing autopilot and new sense-and-avoid technology to help it steer clear of air traffic, bad weather and restricted airspace. It will also include a full parachute system in case of total engine failure, and an auto-land capability if the pilot becomes incapacitated. But Mr Gersh estimates that the TF-X is "about eight to 10 years away" from becoming a reality. Another US outfit, the Indigenous Peoples' Technology and Education Center (I-TEC), has developed the Maverick LSA, a rough terrain buggy that can fly using a rear propeller and parachute combination. Built by Beyond Roads, it is designed to aid humanitarian missions to difficult-to-reach areas. The parachute is hoisted up a flexible mast to prevent it fouling the rear propeller. At the moment, the vehicle is treated as a "kit car" for regulatory purposes and also has a Special Light Sport Aircraft airworthiness certificate. Stefan Klein, co-founder and chief designer at Slovakian firm Aeromobil, caught the flying car bug as a child after watching the French filmFantomas se Dechaine, featuring a Citroen DS that could turn into a rocket-powered plane. A graduate of the Slovak University of Technology and a former head of research projects for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design, he comes from a family of aviators and has spent about 20 years trying to make his dream come true. The svelte-looking "pre-prototype" 2.5, which made its debut flight in Montreal in September this year, is potentially the shape of things to come. With hinged wings that sweep forward for flight, a top air speed of more than 200km/h (124mph) and flight range of 700km (430 miles), the Aeromobil certainly looks like a credible player in the nascent flying car market. But spokeswoman Tatiana Veberova admits: "We haven't even begun to solve the problem of certification yet. We have a long way to go." The 3.0 prototype is likely to be ready in 2014, she said, and the company intends to target the US market where regulatory acceptance is more advanced than in Europe. So technology is finally making flying cars a viable product for the mass market, and regulators are certainly catching up with the speed of development. But are we really ready for motorways in the sky? "Lots of people are still afraid of flying," says Mr Knapinksi at the EAA. "There's a mystery about it. That's also part of its joy. "Gaining cultural acceptance for flying cars will be the last hurdle to overcome." </body>

      <body>Apple has revealed details of requests it has received from governments across the globe to share customer data. The US government, which made between 1,000 and 2,000 requests in the six months to 30 June, topped the list. The firm said the US requests affected 2,000 to 3,000 accounts, adding it gave out data on zero to 1,000 accounts. Apple said the most common "requests involve robberies and other crimes or requests from law enforcement officers searching for missing persons". It said the response usually involves disclosing information about an account holder's iTunes or iCloud account "such as a name and an address". "In very rare cases, we are asked to provide stored photos or email. We consider these requests very carefully and only provide account content in extremely limited circumstances," the firm said. The UK was second on the list, with 127 requests. Spain, Germany and Australia also featured in the top five. The tech giant added that since its main business was "not about collecting information", the vast majority of requests it received from law enforcement agencies were about information on "lost or stolen devices". The company logs these requests under a separate category as "device requests" which, it said, "never include national security-related requests". Apple received more than 3,500 such requests in the US between January and June this year. Apple also used the report to call for more freedom to disclose the details of such requests to customers. It said that currently the US government did not allow it to disclose "except in broad ranges, the number of national security orders, the number of accounts affected by the orders, or whether content, such as emails, was disclosed". "We strongly oppose this gag order," it added. It said it had asked the government to ease these restrictions but so far had not seen any major changes. "Despite our extensive efforts in this area, we do not yet have an agreement that we feel adequately addresses our customers' right to know how often and under what circumstances we provide data to law enforcement agencies". Earlier this year, Google, Facebook and Microsoft asked the US government to allow them to disclose the security requests they receive to hand over user data. The move by these companies came after leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed mass surveillance programmes by the National Security Agency (NSA) and associated agencies. Apple said it had filed a letter with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court supporting a group of cases requesting greater transparency. "We will continue to aggressively pursue our ability to be more transparent." </body>

      <body>Microsoft has warned that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers. It said attackers could exploit this by requesting users to preview or open a specially crafted email or web content. Microsoft said it was "aware of targeted attacks" and was investigating. The issue affects Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Office 2003 - 2010, and Microsoft Lync. The current versions of Microsoft Windows and Office are not affected by the issue - which centres on a graphics component. Microsoft said it would take appropriate action to address the issue, which "may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs". In the meantime, it has advised customers to apply workarounds - a setting or configuration change that "does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available". According to Microsoft, the flaw lies in the handling of the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image files by a graphics processing component in the affected software versions. In a blog post on the Microsoft Security Response Centre, Dustin Childs a communications manager, said any move by hackers "requires user interaction". He said that the attacks are disguised as an email requesting potential targets to open a specially crafted Word attachment. If the attachment is opened or previewed, it attempts to exploit the issue using a malformed graphics image embedded in the document. "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user," Mr Childs said. Microsoft added that hackers could also exploit the issue via a web-based attack. "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website," it said. However, it added that an attacker would have "no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content". "Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website." </body>

      <body>Mystery surrounds two barges that Google has moored off the coast of America. The barges have a four-storey structure on deck and rumours are circulating about what the company plans to use them for. One suggestion is that they could be turned in to floating data centres powered by wave action. Others believe they could be fitted out with new showrooms for Google Glass with a "party deck" on top. So far Google has declined to comment on what the vessels are being used for. But the company does have a patent from 2009 for a "water-based" data centre. "It's an interesting concept," said Nick Layzell, of Telehouse, a data centre provider. "Cooling is the big cost for any data centre, so perhaps they're trying to take advantage of having some water on tap." But he added that water was the biggest threat to data centres because of the damage it could cause to equipment. One of the barges is anchored at Pier 1, Treasure Island Marina in San Francisco. The authority in charge of projects within San Francisco Bay confirmed that it had met with Google officials several times in recent months. Its chief executive Larry Goldzband said that Google had been "less than specific" about its plans. "When they decide to let us know what they plan to do with it, or hope to do with it, then we can decide if it's allowable," he told AP. Documents revealed following a freedom of information request by the The Day newspaper in Connecticut show Google is also linked to a barge near Maine on the eastern coast of the United States. According to the paper, the documents did not explain what the barge would be used for but detailed a plan to "operate" the barge in different ports around the United States starting in New York. </body>

      <description>The Bitcoin virtual currency is vulnerable to a 'selfish' attack that would let someone take control of the digital cash system, warn researchers.</description>

      <body>The Bitcoin virtual currency is vulnerable to a "selfish" attack that would let someone gradually take control of the digital cash system. The theoretical attack tries to subvert the way that computers involved in Bitcoin share information. It plays upon the fact that everyone involved in keeping track of Bitcoin assumes all participants are honest. Such an attack could already be happening, said the US researchers who discovered the vulnerability. "Bitcoin is broken, " wrote Prof Emin Surer, one of the Cornell University scientists who developed the attack, in a blogpost describing the work. The weakness he and Dr Ittay Eyal uncovered is fundamental to the way that Bitcoin works, he said, and emerges from the way that people find or mint new coins. Typically new Bitcoins are generated by getting lots of computers to tackle a complicated cryptographic puzzle. At any given moment thousands of computers are involved in tackling this puzzle. Roughly every ten minutes one group involved in solving this puzzle is rewarded with Bitcoins. The process is known as "mining" because, like miners, those who take part have to sift a lot of dross before they find a valuable nugget. As soon as the new coins are found, the news is circulated and everyone starts working on the next puzzle. One Bitcoin is currently worth about £145. The Cornell attack involves one large mining group that does not say when it has been rewarded with new Bitcoins. This "selfish" mining group then begins working on the cryptographic puzzle that will eventually release the next reward. This gives it an advantage because every other mining group will still be working on a puzzle that has already been solved. By leveraging this advantage and being careful about when they release information about new Bitcoins they have mined, the group could gradually take control of the entire mining system. "Once the system veers away from the happy mode where everyone is honest, there is no force that opposes the growth of really large pools that command control of the currency," wrote Prof Surer. The pair pointed out that there were already mining groups big enough to mount a selfish attack on the protocol. The two researchers have also proposed updating the protocol to limit the size of mining groups and make the whole system less susceptible to a selfish attack. Vitalik Buterin, technical editor of Bitcoin Magazine, said the attack was "highly theoretical" because no software currently existed that could turn an honest mining group into a selfish one. At the moment Bitcoin software shares information about what different miners are doing with the entire community. For a group to become selfish they would have to change this fundamental Bitcoin software in order to manipulate this information flow. In addition, he said, only the biggest pools could try to subvert the system and the communication demands of the network would likely stymie those attempts. In addition, he said, the rewards of selfish behaviour were outweighed by the benefits of being honest. "No honest (or semi-honest) miner would want to join a selfish pool," he suggested. "Even if they do have a small incentive to [join], they have an even greater incentive to not break the Bitcoin network to preserve the value of their own Bitcoins and mining hardware." </body>

      <description>Privacy International demands an investigation into exactly how telecom firms worked with intelligence agencies.</description>

      <body>Privacy International has asked the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to investigate telecoms companies over the alleged interception of private data on their networks. It follows allegations from whistle-blower Edward Snowden that fibre-optic networks were accessed as part of mass surveillance programmes. His latest leaks suggest that data was intercepted on British territory. The privacy group wants more information about how this was done. "With each passing day, the public finds out more and more how private companies are colluding with governments to operate mass surveillance programs that intercept our daily phone calls, text messages, emails and personal data," said Eric King, head of research at Privacy International. "Far from being coerced, it appears some of the companies have gone well beyond their legal responsibility by colluding with GCHQ on its Tempora [data collection] programme. "We call on these companies to do the right thing and halt their involvement with mass surveillance," he added. Privacy International wants companies such as Level 3, BT, Verizon, Vodafone Cable, Viatel and Interoute to explain all the steps they took to oppose or challenge requests from GCHQ, the UK's intelligence gathering headquarters, in Cheltenham. It also wants them to cease any voluntary compliance with GCHQ and introduce policies to ensure that further requests do not interfere with what it calls "the fundamental right to privacy". In response BT said that it would study the details of "any complaint we receive". "We are clear that matters of national security are for governments, not telecommunications providers. As a company, we comply with the law," it told the BBC. Level 3 said: "All of the countries where we deliver services have law enforcement and security concerns, and we are periodically compelled by in-country government authorities to assist in their investigations. Our policy is the same everywhere. We comply with applicable local law, including all the applicable laws in the UK, while taking all reasonable steps to protect our customers' privacy." Meanwhile Interoute declined to comment. "The particular concern of Privacy International is that phone companies and [internet service providers] went beyond what the law required, either because they wanted a quiet life or because they thought that it was a good thing to do," said digital forensic expert Prof Peter Sommer. Unwinding what legislation had been used and whether warrants had been issued for each intercept could be tricky though, he added. "One of the puzzling things is how does it happen politically? Do the spooks go to their political masters and say, 'We are going dark. We can't follow the people we want to follow,' and ask for special warrants?" "And if these are granted why aren't the politicians asking whether it is a good idea or not?" Last week the Washington Post alleged that the US National Security Agency had worked with British counterpart GCHQ to access the private data networks of Yahoo and Google. The paper said it did not know exactly how the interception had worked only that it "happens on British territory". Slides supplied by Edward Snowden appeared to show that the NSA had tools that could pull apart data packages sent across Yahoo and Google's internal networks. The project, referred to as Muscular, was operated by GCHQ and offered "large international access located in the United Kingdom", according to the slide. Companies such as Google have multiple data centres worldwide to share the load of the vast amount of traffic generated daily, making it easier and quicker for consumers to access the data they want. "The allegations are that the spooks are able to get inside these networks, decode the information and reap the benefits," said Prof Sommer. "The UK is a good place to do it because London and Manchester are huge hubs for telecom and internet data," he said. </body>

      <body>More than 100 Britons were among 1,000 men caught trying to pay a computer-generated child to perform sex acts online, after a Dutch children's charity set up a fake profile. Terre des Hommes carried out a 10-week sting near Amsterdam, posing on video chat rooms as "Sweetie", a 10-year-old Filipina girl. Some 20,000 men contacted her, with 1,000 found to have offered her money. The names of these men - including 110 Britons - were passed to police. When I visited the charity's operations room - in a warehouse on the outskirts of Amsterdam - I watched as a researcher logged on to a chat room as Sweetie - incredibly life-like but created by a computer. Within seconds, like sharks, men were circling. Of the 1,000 men who were willing to pay Sweetie to take off her clothes in front of a webcam, 254 were from the US, followed by 110 from the UK and 103 from India. Researchers used evidence including profiles on Skype and social media to identify the suspects. Project director Hans Guyt told a news conference in the Hague on Monday that the crime "requires a new way of policing". "The predator won't come forward. The victim won't come forward," he said. "We identified ourselves as 10-year-old Filipino girls. "We did not solicit anything unless it was offered to us." Terre des Hommes has launched a global campaign to stop "webcam sex tourism". Managing director, Albert Jaap van Santbrink, said: "Our worst-case scenario is that the same will happen with this phenomenon as with child pornography, which is now a multi-billion industry in the hands of criminal gangs." The charity has now handed over its findings to police and has said it will provide authorities with the technology it has developed. But European policing agency Europol has expressed reservations about the findings. "We believe that criminal investigations using intrusive surveillance measures should be the exclusive responsibility of law enforcement agencies," spokesman Soren Pedersen told the Reuters news agency. Andy Baker, of the UK's National Crime Agency, also said that "tackling child sex abusers is best left to specialist law enforcement agencies". But he praised the campaign, saying it had "widened awareness of a global child sex abuse threat". "Working with our international law enforcement partners, we will now look at the information being passed on by Terre des Hommes," he added. Sweetie will not be used again. She has done her job - showing the predators that they can easily become prey. </body>

      <title>'123456' tops Adobe password list</title>
      <description>The number sequence '123456' was the most popular password among Adobe users exposed by a security breach, suggests analysis</description>

      <body>"123456" was the most popular password among the millions of Adobe users whose details were stolen during an attack on the company. About 1.9 million people used the sequence, according to analysis of data lost in the leak. Online copies of the data have let security researchers find out more about users' password-creating habits. The analysis suggests that many people are making it easy for attackers by using easy-to-guess passwords. On 4 October, Adobe reported that its systems had been penetrated by attackers who had stolen the online credentials for millions of its users. Early reports suggested about 2.9 million records had been compromised. On 30 October, this figure was revised, with Adobe saying information about 38 million active users had gone astray. In total, information about more than 150 million accounts was stolen - but many of the other accounts were disused, abandoned or duplicates. Adobe has now shut down all the compromised accounts, saying it will only reopen them once passwords have been changed. Copies of the data that was exposed by the breach have begun circulating online and inspired security researcher Jeremi Gosney to go through it working out which password was most popular. Top of the list, with 1.9 million entries, was the "123456" string of numbers. Second was the slightly longer "123456789" sequence. Other popular easy-to-guess passwords included "adobe123", "qwerty" and "password". Mr Gosney said the results of the analysis should be treated with caution because, so far, no-one had access to the keys that Adobe used to encrypt the data. However, he added, flaws in the way Adobe had stored and encrypted passwords along with clues in the giant file of data had made it possible to draw up a list that he was "fairly confident" was accurate. Computer security researchers who study password-creating habits have also seized on the data dump as a way to refine the word lists they use to attack login systems in a bid to make them more secure. Lists of passwords and email addresses are a boon to attackers not just because they can be used to get access to the systems they were supposed to secure. Many people re-use the same password for different services potentially giving attackers a way into other networks. </body>

      <title>Call of Duty faces 'slower' sales</title>
      <description>The creator of Call of Duty: Ghosts says initial sales of the game may be slower than its predecessor because of the launch of new games consoles.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24803894</url>

      <body>The creator of the latest Call of Duty video game has acknowledged that initial sales of the title are likely to be slower than last time round. CoD: Ghosts launches weeks ahead of the release of Sony and Microsoft's new consoles. As a result, Mark Rubin, studio head at developer Infinity Ward, said some gamers would wait for the new hardware to become available. The previous game, CoD: Black Ops II, made $1bn (£630m) within 15 days. By the end of last year, more than 2.6 million copies had been sold in the UK alone - nearly double the number of tickets bought for the Avengers Assemble movie - making it the country's best-selling entertainment release of 2012. "Next-gen has historically created a bit of a challenge for all games from a numbers standpoint," Mr Rubin told the BBC. "It's definitely something we're aware of. I know talking to a lot of people, figuring out what they're going to buy is a problem. "I think it will be spread out a little bit - it's harder to do the day-one [sales]... but I think we're in a good spot." He added that to encourage early take-up, publisher Activision was offering purchasers of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 games discounted copies of the Xbox One and PS4 editions if they upgraded within a time limit. The launch is publisher Activision Blizzard's first since it gained its independence by using debt to buy most of French firm Vivendi's shares in the business. Ghosts is the first game in a new story arc, set in 2023 - a future in which much of the US lies in ruins after an attack by a space weapons system. In the single-player campaign, players take part in a military unit attempting to lead a fight-back against a new South American superpower. It is being released just over a decade after the first CoD game went on sale. As part of efforts to keep the franchise fresh, Infinity Ward has added features not available before. These include: Gameplay in both the current and next-generation console editions is similar, although the latter promises superior graphics and the ability to have more people involved in multi-player battles. "Early adopters of consoles will want a game that impresses visually," said Michael French, publisher of games trade magazine MCV. "The games don't have to be 100% original. Eventually over time the audience will want something new - the big franchises will have to either take some time out or totally reinvent themselves. "But for those buying close to day one, they just want something that looks better." Ghosts will compete against Electronic Arts' recently released war game Battlefield 4 - which has won praise for its large-scale multiplayer maps - and its highly anticipated sci-fi shooter Titanfall, which has been developed by several former members of Infinity Ward. Mr Rubin caused surprise last week when he revealed that only the PlayStation 4 version renders Ghosts in full 1080p high-definition video. The Xbox One and Nintendo's Wii U consoles will deliver 720p graphics - half the resolution - despite the fact they can support the higher-quality format. "We did what we could to make sure each platform looked as good as it could and that it performed," Mr Rubin told the BBC. "One of the key pillars of Call of Duty has been 60 frames per second... and ensuring that was of utmost importance, and the resolutions that appear are geared around that." The PS4 and Xbox One are both powered by customised chips from the same manufacturer, AMD - however, Sony's machine has more cores in its graphics processing unit (GPU) and uses faster, albeit more expensive, RAM memory. However, Mr Rubin did not rule out future CoD titles running in 1080p on Microsoft's machine. "It don't think it's the case that the Xbox One definitely can't do it - I just think that we need time to get there. "It's a normal thing when new platforms come out that the first games are trying to find their feet. "An analogy I use is that it's like an awkward first date - you're still trying to figure each other out. "There's enormous amounts of work ahead of us in perfecting our game engines on both platforms." </body>

      <title>Tesco to use face-scan ad targeting</title>
      <description>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target adverts at different types of customers.</description>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all of its 450 forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, from Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <title>Netflix tests 4K video streams</title>
      <description>Netflix tests "ultra high definition" video streaming as it looks to launch a full service to users in 2014.</description>

      <body>Netflix, the TV and film streaming service, has started testing "ultra high definition" video. Also known as 4K the technology offers four times the amount of detail as 1080p high-definition content. Netflix said it plans to offer the first titles in 4K to customers next year. But some analysts question whether broadband speeds in the UK are fast enough to cope with ultra high definition streaming. "Average broadband speeds in the UK are 7.6 megabits per second, you would need to have at least double that speed to watch 4K reliably on a streamed basis," says IHS broadband analyst, Richard Broughton. "Currently only 15% to 20% of households have the speeds necessary." Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of "superfast" speeds, defined by Ofcom watchdog as 30Mbps or above. Craig Nelson, spokesman for the Internet Service Providers' Association, told the BBC: "We think streaming of 4K TV services will require minimum broadband speeds of about 100Mbps to work properly, but only businesses, production houses and a limited number of homes currently have that kind of speed. "A lot will depend on the compression technologies, or codecs, service providers use. "The real hindrance won't be broadband speeds but the availability of screens." Only a few manufacturers currently make 4K TVs and, as with all cutting-edge technologies, they are expensive. For example, Panasonic's 65in LED 4K TV costs £5,500, while Sony's equivalent costs £5,000. </body>

      <body>A robot developed by Japanese scientists is so fast it can "win" the rock-paper-scissors game against a human every single time. The Janken robot - named after the game's Japanese name - is a faster version of one unveiled by University of Tokyo researchers in June 2012. Version two completes its chosen hand shape almost at the same time as the human hand. It uses high-speed recognition and reaction, rather than prediction. Technically, the robot cheats because it reacts extremely quickly to what the human hand is doing rather than making a premeditated simultaneous action as the rules state. Taking just one millisecond (ms) - a thousandth of a second - to recognise what shape the human hand is making, it then chooses a winning move and reacts at high speed. Version one completed its shape 20ms after the human hand; version two finishes almost simultaneously. The scientists at the Ishikawa Oku Laboratory, part of the University of Tokyo, specialise in a range of technologies, including "sensor fusion", which aims to replicate and improve upon the human senses using high-speed intelligent robots. But Sethu Vijayakumar, professor of robotics at Edinburgh University, told the BBC: "These robots are really fast at reaction, but there are scenarios where even a millisecond's delay is not acceptable, such as accident avoidance or virtual stock markets. "In these cases we need to combine high-speed reaction with high-speed prediction, using game theory and behaviour patterning." </body>

      <body>The micro-blogging company Twitter has increased its estimate of shares' value by 25%. It now says they will sell for between $23-25 (about £15) a share on Monday, from a previous target of $17-20. Demand for the shares has been so heavy the company is ending the offer a day early. The estimate values the seven-year old company, which currently has 218 million monthly users but has yet to make a profit, at up to $13.6bn. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. It is selling 70 million shares, which thanks to the revised share price valuation will raise up to $2bn. There is likely to be enough pent-up demand as a result of the shortened offer time and analysts expect the shares to rise once they begin trading later this week. The share offer is the most hotly anticipated since Facebook's flotation in 2012, but the massive hype turned to disappointment after the share price fell in the following days. Unlike Twitter, Facebook increased the number of shares it was releasing to take advantage of the hot demand at the time, a move some analysts say oversupplied the market. The final price of Twitter's initial public offering (IPO) will be set to price on Wednesday, with shares making their debut on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday. The traditional home for technology companies is the Nasdaq exchange, but Twitter chose the NYSE instead after trading in Facebook's shares hit difficulties due to the heavy demand. The NYSE has already tested trading of Twitter's shares to try to clear up any technical hitches that it may face when shares go public. Twitter also said on Monday it had received a letter from IBM alleging it had infringed at least three of IBM's US patents. Patent disputes are a regular feature between technology companies. </body>

      <title>US to build hypersonic spy plane</title>
      <description>The US has revealed plans to develop a robot spy plane that is designed to fly at six times the speed of sound.</description>

      <body>Lockheed Martin has begun work on a successor to the supersonic Blackbird SR-71 spy plane. The unmanned SR-72 will use an engine that combines a turbine and a ramjet to reach its top speed of Mach 6 - about 3,600mph (5,800km/h). Like its predecessor, the SR-72 will be designed for high-altitude surveillance but might also be fitted with weapons to strike targets. Lockheed said the aircraft should be operational by 2030. The SR-72 is being developed at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works RandD centre in California that designed and built the original Blackbird. That aircraft first flew in 1964 and was a mainstay of US Air Force spying and surveillance work until 1998. It typically flew at altitudes of 24,000m (80,000ft) and could reach speeds of Mach 3. In a blogpost about the SR-72, Lockheed Martin said the aircraft would operate at similar altitudes but would fly far faster. At Mach 6 the plane could travel the 3,500 miles (5,500km) from New York to London in less than an hour. While spy satellites can photograph enemy territory, the relatively long time it takes for them to be moved to a new orbit so they pass over a target can limit their usefulness. By contrast, wrote Lockheed Martin, the SR-72 "would be so fast, an adversary would have no time to react or hide". For the SR-72, Lockheed Martin is drawing on work done on the Falcon HTV-2 hypersonic technology vehicle. This is a test-bed for the futuristic technologies needed to support safe hypersonic flight and cope with the extreme conditions encountered by any object flying at such a speed. For instance, on one test flight of the HTV-2, the aircraft hit a top speed of Mach 20 and its flight surfaces reached 1,927C (3,500F). To reach Mach 6, the SR-72 will use an engine that acts like a normal jet turbine until speeds of Mach 3 are reached but which then operates like a ramjet to accelerate beyond that. "Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades," said Brad Leland, Lockheed Martin's hypersonic programme manager on the blog. "The technology would be a game-changer in theatre, similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today." </body>

      <body>Shares in struggling smartphone maker Blackberry have fallen 16% after it announced it had abandoned a plan to sell itself to its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings. Instead, it intends to raise $1bn (£627m) in fresh financing. Chief executive Thorsten Heins will step down and former Sybase chief executive John Chen will serve as interim chief executive. Last month, Blackberry reported a second-quarter net loss of $965m. Those losses were blamed on poor sales of its new smartphone, the Z10. Fairfax was planning to lead a consortium of firms in a takeover of Blackberry worth $4.7bn. But that plan, announced last month, has fallen through. Last week, Reuters reported that Fairfax was struggling to raise the financing needed for the deal. Instead, Fairfax, which owns a 10% stake in Blackberry, is contributing $250m to the new fund-raising. "This financing provides an immediate cash injection on terms favourable to Blackberry, enhancing our substantial cash position," said Barbara Stymiest, chair of Blackberry's board of directors. In September, the company announced a plan to cut 4,500 jobs, or 40% of its workforce, to reverse giant losses. The interim chief executive, John Chen, acknowledged the challenge ahead: "Blackberry is an iconic brand with enormous potential - but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success." Some analysts remain sceptical about the firm's prospects. "Now we're back to the downward spiral," said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. "They've got $1bn more cash that buys them time. The drumbeat of negativity is likely to continue." </body>

      <description>Zynga's Scramble With Friends game does not infringe Mattel's Scrabble trademarks, a High Court judge rules.</description>

      <body>Zynga's Scramble With Friends word game for mobile devices does not infringe Mattel's Scrabble trademarks, a High Court judge has ruled. Mattel had argued that Zynga's use of the word "Scramble" was too close to the word "Scrabble". But Mr Justice Peter Smith disagreed. However, he did accept that Zynga's use of a curly letter M in the logo "gives the impression that the word is Scrabble when one looks at it quickly and has the propensity to confuse". This means Zynga will have to change the game's logo, but not the name itself. US company Mattel, the world's biggest toy manufacturer, owns brands such as Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price Toys, as well as Scrabble. In response to the ruling, Mattel spokesman Alan Hilowitz said: "We are pleased that the English High Court today affirmed Mattel's request for an injunction against Zynga, finding that the similarities between their Scramble With Friends logo and Mattel's intellectual property likely would confuse the public into thinking they were in fact downloading Scrabble. "We are, however, disappointed that the court did not rule that Zynga should cease using the Scramble name, which Mattel intends to appeal." Zynga said it was not prepared to comment on the case. The ruling will be a relief to Zynga, the online games company that made its stock market debut in December 2011 and was valued at $1bn (£630m). Since then it has struggled to replicate the success of games such as FarmVille and Words With Friends. In October, the company reported a net loss of $68,000 for its third quarter, compared with a $57.3m loss for the same period last year. While the results were better than expected, year-on-year revenues fell 36% to $202.5m and the number of fee-paying players has halved to about 1.6 million. But chief executive Don Mattrick, who joined Zynga in July from his role as head of interactive entertainment at Microsoft, maintained that a return to profitability was in sight for the company. Zynga bought OMGPOP, the company behind the popular game Draw Something, for $200m in March 2012, but shut the company less than a year later. Despite the setbacks, Zynga's share price has risen 60% over the past 52 weeks. </body>

      <body>A hacking group calling itself Anonymous Indonesia claims to have attacked over 170 Australian sites, following reports of Australian spying. The sites affected seemed to belong primarily to small businesses. On Friday, Indonesia summoned Australia's ambassador amid reports that its Jakarta embassy was used as part of a US-led spying network. The reports were based on a US National Security Agency document leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The allegations caused anger in Indonesia, which is a key ally and trading partner of Australia. The Australian government has declined to comment on the reports, saying it does not comment on intelligence matters. Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa told reporters on Monday: "Enough is enough". "While [the US and Australia] are not able to confirm or deny past activities, at least they should be able, and I'm making a public expectation here, I think they should be able to say henceforth they are not going to do it anymore," he said. "In the absence of assurances that such [spying] activities never took place, then of course we must assume that such activities are taking place, and draw our own conclusion in terms of their view of Indonesia as a partner," he added. Anonymous Indonesia posted a list on Twitter of more than 100 Australian websites it said it had hacked. Sites affected including a bouncy castle company and a dry cleaner. Affected websites were replaced with the message: "Stop spying on Indonesia", and an image of a Guy Fawkes silhouette on the Indonesia and Australian flags. Members of the online group wear Guy Fawkes masks when demonstrating in public or in online videos. The spying allegations were originally published by German newspaper Der Spiegel. The newspaper described a signals intelligence programme called Stateroom which intercepted radio, telecommunications and internet traffic using equipment in US, British, Australian and Canadian diplomatic missions. Diplomatic posts involved included those in Jakarta, Bangkok, Hanoi, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur, amongst others, the Sydney Morning Herald reported late last week. The reports are the latest in a series of documents leaked by ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia and is wanted in the US in connection with the unauthorised disclosures. The US is facing growing anger over reports it spied on its allies abroad. However, correspondents say that in reality most governments conduct surveillance or espionage operations against other countries whose activities matter to them. </body>

      <body>Imax, the cinema technology company specialising in immersive 3D screenings, is to offer home cinemas for China's wealthy elite in a joint venture with Shenzhen's TCL Multimedia. Each luxury theatre will cost at least $250,000 (£157,000), Reuters reported. "China now is our second largest market in the world, and our fastest growing market," Imax chief executive Richard Gelfond said. The company is also targeting Russia, Hong Kong and the Middle East. China's burgeoning wealthy class is hungry for luxury goods of all kinds, with TCL estimating that the home theatre market will grow 20% a year over the next five years. Three-D films are also growing in popularity, with more than 80% of audiences for the recent blockbuster film Gravity opting for the 3D format thanks to the film's ground-breaking special effects. Luxury, immersive home cinemas are now possible - albeit only for the rich - thanks to advancements in 3D and large-screen technology. Shooting a film with dedicated Imax cameras used to cost more than £6m before the company developed a way of converting standard films to Imax format using algorithms for less than £1m. Producers started making films specifically for 3D, with James Cameron's Avatar in 2009 proving to be the first mainstream 3D box office success, taking about $250m in Imax theatres. Imax already earns 16% of its revenue in China, and now has 131 screens installed there. In July, it announced an agreement with China's Dalian Wanda Group Corp to build up to 120 new cinemas in the country, building on its 2011 deal with the group. </body>

      <title>Insect-like drone is 'crash happy'</title>
      <description>Flying robot Gimball has been designed to bounce off objects to cope with chaotic environments after a disaster</description>

      <body>An insect-like flying rescue robot that can bounce off trees and buildings has been revealed by its creators. Gimball has been developed to be used in situations that are hazardous to humans. The robot is designed to be able to deal with crashes, and to right itself after a collision. Gimball has a protective spherical roll-cage, and is mounted on pivots to stay upright. The flying robot, which bounces off walls, moves in a similar way to a mosquito. Gimball was in part inspired by the way insects fly, co-creator Adrien Briod told the BBC. "Usually robots need to move around obstacles, so we thought it would be interesting to allow it to sustain collisions," Mr Briod said. The drone, described as "crash happy", was designed and built by a team in Switzerland at the Ecole Polytechnique Federerale de Lausanne (EPFL). The robot was developed for use in disaster situations, such as entering a building on fire, or after a radiation leak. Normally flying robots are taken out of action by a major collision, but the designers did not think the problem could be solved by adding more sensors. To keep Gimball lightweight, the research team decided to allow the robot to ricochet off obstacles instead. The robot has a rotating flexible frame that lets it bounce off anything that it hits in a chaotic environment. To stay upright, Gimball has a gyroscopic system that includes an accelerometer, the same type of sensor as used in smartphones to let the phone know which way is up. The battery-driven robot has two propellers, and is steered by fins. It is fitted with a motion sensor, a camera, an altimeter, a magnetic compass and a micro-controller processor. The 34cm (13 inch) , 370g (13oz) drone can lift weights of up to 30g, so can carry gas or radioactivity sensors, Mr Briod said. The robot can be remotely controlled, but Mr Briod aims to eventually incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities into Gimball to allow it to accomplish complex tasks by itself. The team that built Gimball at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL included Mr Briod and engineer Mariusz Kornatowski. </body>

      <body>Near Field Communications (NFC) technology allows small amounts data to be exchanged when enabled devices are tapped or held closely together or one device is touched against an NFC tag. Although the technology can be found in many smartphones, credit cards and passports it has yet to become mainstream. But Singapore's size and willingness to embrace new technology might make it the perfect place to roll out a nationwide NFC network. Spencer Kelly finds out more.

      <body>Kate Russell's weekly review of the best apps and websites. This week we take a look at some data visualisation tools that might help you understand your social networks a little more. Mentionapp connects to Twitter and lets you explore how users are linked to each other by the hashtags they use. Facebook fans can try Friend-wheel - an interesting visualisation that shows all the connections between your friends - you might be surprised to learn who knows who. And for all you LinkedIn fans, there is a visualisation tool that lays bare a colour-coded map of your contacts to see how they are all interlinked on this enormous business network. As well as being a social space, the web is great if you like to create and Sketchtoy serves up a fun platform for any freehand artists to try their hand and making something lovely in a wibbly-wobbly drawing style that is quite hypnotic. Another interesting sharing app which is available free on Apple and Android is Chirp.io. This unique system uses a burst of sound - a bit like birdsong - to transmit the data required to share an image to any phones using the app within hearing range. A burst of chirp and the image instantly appears on the other phone. Music fans should set a reminder for a first this weekend. YouTube - the site that made Justin Bieber famous - is launching its own music awards. The event will be headlined by Lady Gaga and streamed live on 3 November 2013.

      <body>A robot developed by Japanese scientists is so fast it can "win" the rock-paper-scissors game against a human every single time. The Janken robot - named after the game's Japanese name - is a faster version of one unveiled by University of Tokyo researchers in June 2012. Version two completes its chosen hand shape almost at the same time as the human hand. It uses high-speed recognition and reaction, rather than prediction - effectively cheating.

      <body>New York City officials collect an extraordinary amount of data, ranging from information about parking meters to phone calls to a city-run help line. A new law signed last year by Mayor Michael Bloomberg requires the release of all public data by December 2018. In the meantime, officials who work for city agencies may be granted access to other agencies' information in order to help their workflow. And entrepreneurs can tap into the data. "With the news of the NSA and Prism and all that stuff, people are scared about big data," says Joel Natividad, the co-founder of Pediacities.com, which compiles data about restaurants and schools.

The screens, manufactured by Lord Sugar's digital sign company Amscreen, will have an inbuilt camera to identify a customer's age and gender and will then play targeted advertisements. A Tesco spokesperson said the technology does not use facial recognition software, have eyeball scanners, record data or identify customers in any way - it simply estimates age and gender. Technology expert Tom Cheesewright told BBC Radio 5 live's Richard Bacon: "So much of this stuff happens today online already and you don't even know it.

      <title>Ways to plan a hi-tech wedding</title>
      <description>How to plan a hi-tech wedding</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24759238</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70923000/jpg/_70923249_laptops.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Anyone taking a casual stroll around the average wedding fair could be forgiven for thinking that here is a ceremony whose technology has not been updated since the days of Jane Austen. When you consider that the industry is worth more than £10bn a year in the UK alone, you would think the tech giants would be eager to give it a makeover. Instead it is smaller-scale pioneers who are making the in-roads into a sector where tradition still reigns supreme. The BBC asked bride-to-be Ella Williamson to discover how hi-tech a wedding can become. Over the past year, fashion and technology have fused like never before. We've seen the model Dita von Teese step out in the world's first 3D-printed dress and singer Nicole Sherzinger perform in an outfit showing tweets via LED lights threaded into its fabric. So, is it possible to purchase a bridal gown that displays well wishes from loved ones? CuteCircuit, the company behind the Twitter Dress, confirms it would take on such a commission. But its chief creative director suggests a more subtle concoction. "We have made wedding outfits using conductive silver fabric that create a connection when the marrying couple kiss, triggering a private message on the linings of their garments," says Francesca Rosella. The time-honoured ritual of wearing a hat to a wedding has undergone a technological revamp too. Belgian 3D-printing firm i.materialise dabbled with headwear when it launched a millinery competition for designers last year. It now offers two services for creating bespoke headgear - collaborate with one of the company's recommended designers or alternatively design your own and then have it made in the lab. The company's community officer, Tatiana de Wee, adds that 3D-printed "wedding rings, engagement rings and wedding cake toppers" are available too. Merging the virtual world and the real world is an innovative way of getting guests to save the date. So, printing firms have started to offer augmented-reality-enhanced products, allowing invitations to come to life. The process is straightforward - record a one-minute video and send the MP4 file to the company to incorporate it. By holding a smartphone or tablet over the card, the guests can then view a personal message from the bride and groom. Advocates for the tech have claimed it has been about to take off for years - but one of the businesses involved insists the wedding industry is ripe for an AR revolution. "After a slow start 18 months ago, augmented reality printing is now proving popular thanks to increased smartphone ownership, 4G networks and advertising campaigns," Chris Hughes, managing director at Stuprint.com, tells the BBC. No tech wedding is complete without at least one robot. At least Japanese couple Tomohiro Shibata and Satoko Inoue thought so. Their ceremony in 2010 was conducted by i-Fairy, a £46,000 robot by Kokoro. But in 2014, getting married by an automaton should become more affordable thanks to the launch of Oscar the WeddingBot. Oscar is a 2ft (61cm) robot intended to be an officiant, pageboy, usher or speech giver. It uses an Arduino computer as its brain, features a text-to-speech module to talk and a high-definition video camera to see, while the hands were salvaged from a broken Kinderbot toy. "After I completed my first home-made robot in 2012, my friends Mark and Sarah joked about having him at their wedding," says Minneapolis-based inventor Jon Shmig. "I told them I'd make a custom robot and as the list of features expanded I realised that other people may be interested in his services." A prototype was used as a ring bearer at a ceremony in August, and Mr Shmig says he hopes to make the final version available for hire in the US early next year. He adds it will be able to move in time to music - so, be careful that he doesn't cut in to your first dance. With 50,000 downloads in eight weeks alone, Brazil's Boyfriend Tracker app has shown many people want to know their partner's movements. The software secretly sends GPS location and SMS updates about a handset's whereabouts. This begs the question - when will a GPS chip-enabled wedding ring come to market? US engineer Benjamin Kokes has created an engagement ring for his fiancee that features embedded LEDs that illuminate when in close proximity to a specially designed transmitter. But he has doubts about adding a Find My Spouse feature. "I would not rely specifically on GPS - with current technology you couldn't pack enough battery into the ring to have any useful operation," he says. Instead he suggests including a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, which could be detected by strategically placed reader units. For less suspicious but more forgetful nearly-weds, Alaska Jewelry is developing the Remember Ring. The piece of jewellery, which is still at the concept stage, promises to self-heat 24 hours before your anniversary as a reminder. A built-in micro-thermopile would convert the heat from the wearer's hand into electricity to keep its tiny battery charged and its clock running. "We've received quite a bit of interest," says Alaska's Cleve Oines. "But we probably would not launch a GPS ring as GPS trackers and wedding rings are on opposite sides of the sentiment spectrum." If gadget shopping has left you little time to plan the rest of the celebrations, the web can again come to the rescue. American wedding planner TheKnot.com held what's thought to be the first crowdsourced wedding in New York on Valentine's Day this year. Members of the public voted online to select each element of the day - from the outfits to the Modern Ice Castle wedding theme. And if that doesn't sound ideal, you can always Photoshop the pictures. </body>

      <description>Beck, Arcade Fire and the music videos inviting fans in</description>

      <body>Picture the scene: you're at home watching the latest concert by your favourite musician. The crowd is raving, the singer approaches them holding the microphone out and a few people climb past security onto the stage. But alas, stuck in front of your computer screen, you can't join them. Except now you can - if you're a fan of American musician Beck, that is. He is one of a few artists making interactive music videos requiring fan participation. Throughout his 20-year career the industry has seen many changes, including more people now watching music videos on YouTube than on MTV. Beck has made many memorable music videos, though he started out with limited means. "[For] my first video we had no money," he says. "I had a friend who had film in the freezer left over from film school and we used that one roll of film. "Every frame was precious." The video in question was for his hit song Loser, which went on to sell half a million copies and became one of the defining singles of the 1990s. "I was surprised when some of these videos actually got played," he continues about his early releases. "Most of them were just friends who were making them and editing them." Since then the 43-year-old has collaborated with acclaimed directors such as Spike Jonze and Michael Gondry on his music videos. Earlier this year he took this one step further, developing a 360 degree experience with director Chris Milk. In Hello Again viewers can join Beck onstage or stroll around among the 170 musicians as they play David Bowie's Sound and Vision. Viewers move around by turning on their computer's webcam and moving their heads in the direction they want to move in. For Beck, music videos can create a strong connection between bands and fans in the digital age. "I grew up in an era where the packaging was such a big part of how you related to the music," he says. The cover of Psychocandy, the first Jesus and Mary Chain album, which has a bold design and stark red, white and black colour scheme, had an especially strong influence on how he related to the band and came to understand them. "It gave me enough information, it opened up a whole idea about where this music is coming from and what it was." He believes music videos can fulfil this role in today's digital era where there is less emphasis on physical records. "I felt that they were album artwork come to life," he says about these videos. The Google Creative Lab's Aaron Koblin has directed several interactive music videos. The 31-year-old heads the data arts team and grew up in the era of big budget videos which played a large role in teen culture, but says the fan was passive. "When I used to watch music videos it was very much 'I am receiving the content which is helping me understand and create a picture of the musician's identity'," he says. "But it didn't necessarily make me feel all that much closer." He thinks interactive web-based videos enable a new way of creating that bond. He has worked with Arcade Fire on videos that require fans to interact with the band. "I hope we can create a deeper emotional experience which will then help bring a better connection," he says. Together with director Vincent Morisset, he aimed to do just that with the Just A Reflektor project, which uses the title track from Arcade Fire's latest album. Fans connect their smartphone to their webcam via a unique code on the video's site. By moving their smartphone around viewers can change the visual effects on the video, creating sprinkles of light and colour. They also can guide the protagonist on her journey and eventually join her. "Your phone and computer are actually talking to each other," Mr Koblin says. "The computer is observing and talking about the phone's location and movement and in doing that is able to construct and change the story based around the way the phone is being moved around." While videos are increasingly being viewed on the internet, interactive web-based ones are still rare. Just A Reflektor uses new code and tools, that were specifically created for the Google Chrome browser. "These things aren't that easy to make yet," Mr Koblin explains. Creating these new tools is currently the most expensive part of making these videos. "That's part of why when we create them we're releasing a lot of the code that we used and a lot of the tools that we created so we can encourage other people to get involved." Arcade Fire have tried the interactive experience before in another experiment for Google Chrome. The song We Used To Wait was used by Mr Koblin and Mr Milk to become the interactive experience The Wilderness Downtown, which uses Google Earth to bring a new dimension to the song. Viewers type in their home address and will see images of where they grew up within the video. Jordan Gauthier is an Arcade Fire fan and says their interactive videos have strengthened his relationship with the band. He grew up in the French suburban town of Rennes and says The Wilderness Downtown made him relate to the song in a new way by helping him recall his childhood memories. "It's like putting your own memories into the video," he says. "I thought that was amazing." Ultimately Beck thinks the web opens up numerous possibilities to interact with fans. "I think that's an infinite idea," he says. "That kind of idea is going to spread because the technology exists." He points to the success of crowdfunding in other fields and thinks more videos will source their ideas and materials from fans in the future. Mr Koblin and Mr Milk crowdsourced for The Johnny Cash Project, which features the song Ain't No Grave. Released after Cash's death, the interactive site pays tribute to him through a video made up of stills drawn by fans. Viewers can then select and watch the frames in different orders. As material is continuously being added to the project, every viewing is unique. Crowdsourcing can also build closer bonds between fans themselves, according to British director Ninian Doff. He crowdsourced images of fans dancing to make the video for Graham Coxon's What It'll Take. One hundred fans sent in videos from 28 countries, and Mr Doff cut up all the videos for the final piece. "It's a big jumble," he explains. "Sometimes it's one person's legs and another person's top half, or it's one person's legs, one person's body, one person's head. "It's like making a Frankenstein out of fans' bodies." And people managed to find themselves and each other through leaving comments about the video online. "One person commented saying, 'Oh that's me at 2 minutes 5 seconds'," Mr Doff says. "Then another person replied, 'I'm your legs at 2 minutes 5 seconds'. "They'd managed to meet over the internet through being connected in the video." </body>

      <title>Could we hatch a British Twitter?</title>
      <description>Rory considers if Twitter would have thrived had it been British</description>

      <body>For Jack Dorsey, Ev Williams, and Biz Stone these are heady days. A plan hatched just seven years ago now looks certain to culminate in a triumphant stock market debut for Twitter this week. But I've been gnawing over two nagging questions. How did Twitter's co-founders, who never seemed that sure what kind of business they wanted to build, end up with the right recipe? And why don't we in the UK seem able to produce similar companies? The first question was provoked by reading an excellent new book about the company, Nick Bilton's Hatching Twitter. It paints a picture of three men not quite out of the top drawer of Silicon Valley software types, each with something of an inferiority complex, at least when mixing with all the Stanford and MIT graduates at firms such as Google. Perhaps because of that, they seem even more determined to follow their own path. While they are working together at a failed start-up called Odeo, founded by Williams, the idea of Twitter emerges as a side venture - although whose original idea it is, will become a matter of enduring acrimony. Indeed the feuding between the founders - and in particular Williams and Dorsey - over who should run the business and what direction it should take is on an epic scale. First Dorsey is forced out as CEO, then after months of plotting, he exacts his revenge and Williams suffers a similar fate. The two disagree fundamentally on what Twitter is for - Dorsey believes it's all about sharing your status with friends, so the status update box says, "What are you doing?". But Ev changes that to "What's happening?' to reflect his belief that Twitter has a broader mission as a place to share news. But neither seems to worry too much about finding a business model, and it is only when Dick Costolo is elevated to CEO in the coup led by Dorsey that the commercialisation of the service begins in earnest. That at least is the picture painted by Nick Bilton, and it certainly rings true. The three co-founders have come together again to appear in the video shown to potential investors in the run-up to this week's IPO. Sitting perched on stools they don't look at ease in each other's company, and the video does nothing to explain just why they believe Twitter can make the huge amounts of money it needs to justify an ever higher valuation. But, by accident or design, they have built a global audience and are now starting to convince advertisers that Twitter can offer them a smart way to connect with customers. So many things have gone wrong along the way, from the internal feuding to the constant technology problems that took the site offline for hours or even days at a time, that it seems a miracle that it has come so far. Which brings me to my second question: Why was Twitter possible in California but not in the UK? From ARM to Mind Candy, we do produce successful tech firms, but nothing that grows so far and so fast as a Twitter or a Facebook. We have people just as talented as Dorsey or Stone, but somehow they never get quite as far. Apart from the important fact that it provides a huge market for any start-up, the other answer for me is that the US, and Silicon Valley in particular, is still a place where optimism rules and anything feels possible. Despite all the setbacks and disagreements, the Twitter trio and their venture capital backers remained profoundly positive about their belief that their technology could change the world. Here in the UK, our first reaction to anything new is too often a furrowed brow or a dismissive sneer rather than a "Wow, that's cool!" Even for the most optimistic entrepreneur it is difficult to keep going when everyone is telling you that you're doomed to fail. The sad truth is that most tech start-ups will fail to meet their founders' expectations - but unless we believe that there is a chance that just a few will make it big, then we're unlikely to hatch a British Twitter. </body>

      <body>No-one knows exactly who is behind them, but in towns, villages and cities right across the UK, "Spotted In" Facebook pages are springing up - offering a kind of local information, dating site, and lost and found service all rolled into one. From big cities and towns like Cardiff and Reading, to the small village of Grampound in Cornwall, these sites are increasingly popular. In many places, more than one in 10 people are following their local "Spotted In" site. Almost all have been set up within the past year. The posts are a dizzying splash of late night post-pub sprawls, people shopping in pyjamas, and information about firework displays - all rolled up in typically British humour. Popular posts on the Spotted in Andover site include a cat found in bin - who became known locally as "Bin Cat" or "Stealth Pussy" - and the "so bad it's good" local rapper video (which spurred its own parody). Lost pets, wallets and ID are more regular fare - as is online flirting. "There are lots of happy endings... We are still waiting for our first engagement and wedding. It will happen though!" Some Spotted sites deal with serious subjects too. Spotted in Ipswich - which has more than 13,000 likes - was the first to expose a local man who claimed to have terminal cancer as a fraud. Also hugely popular are sites like Spotted on a Bus, Spotted on the Train, and Spotted on the Road. Some Spotted sites have had problems with bullying and harassment and have closed down - the most successful ones operate strict house rules and are carefully moderated. "It's almost like a forum for the town," says the admin of Spotted in Chippenham - who admits that being privy to the Wiltshire town's most "juicy secrets" is one of the perks of running the site. "Just to hear people say 'Did you see that on Spotted last night' is brilliant. My mum often talks about it and so does most of Chippenham." Spotted in Chippenham - like other sites - though is run anonymously. Not even his mum knows. Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <body>Back in the 1970s, Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak, and the rest, if you like, is history. The two became firm friends and although Steve Jobs often gets the credit for Apple's success, it was Woz, as he's known, who was the brains behind the silicon. He spoke to the BBC's technology programme Click. Computers are on the verge of understanding human gestures and speech, but it has not yet been perfected. Wozniak says he often finds Android human speech recognition software is more accurate than Apple's Siri. "Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is. And very often usually I find out that Android does." Wozniak says this is due to Android's access to Google's search engine. "That is actually the future of intelligence probably for computers getting smarter and getting artificial intelligence. I wish to God that Apple and Google were partners in the future." But how likely would a partnership between the two companies be? "I don't know. If I were there, it would be pretty likely. I'm probably wrong, there's probably an awful lot I don't know about the business concerns and one thing you've got to remember is a company has always got to make money," says Wozniak. Encouraging openness and sharing information and methods would benefit everyone to develop the best technology, Wozniak says. "I believe you should have a world where you've got to license something at a fair price. There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone. I wish Apple would use them and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us," he says. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology, all our products would be better, we'd go further. I do wish they were more compatible." Wozniak believes more sharing between companies would lead to developments in bigger and better technology in wearable tech, like smartwatches and augmented reality glasses. "I want a full smartphone-like capability on my wrist. The trouble is the more I think about it, I don't want the small size. "We're just at the verge of having products that have foldability and flexibility," he says. "For about three or four years I've been talking about organic LED displays that could be theoretically printed on plastic, wrapped and folded," he says. "But think outside of the box. It could be on the inside of your arm and then when you flip your arm up it could actually flip open into your own hand." Despite his legacy, Wozniak is not seen as an Apple insider these days. But he is still beloved by many of the Mac faithful. "His comments aren't influential in any shape or form. He was one of the founders of Apple and walked away, so the fan boys love him. He is free to say anything he likes," says Stuart Miles, founder of technology news website Pocket-lint. "I don't think he has any insight or influence into the inner workings of how Apple works. But nonetheless he is a fascinating storyteller," he says.

      <title>Facebook beheading: Who was the woman?</title>
      <description>Who was Mexico's Jane Doe?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24772724</url>

      <body>A film of a woman being beheaded in Mexico caused an international outcry in October when Facebook refused to remove it from its site. There have been hundreds of reports about the video - but why has no-one identified the victim in it? In the grainy footage, the woman is on her knees in jeans and a pink top, before a masked man holding a knife behind her says in a gruff voice: "Well, gentleman, this is what happens to all those in the Gulf Cartel. On behalf of Los Zetas." The rest of the video is a gruesome 40 seconds of cold-blooded murder, which caused international controversy recently when it was posted on Facebook. "Irresponsible" was the word used by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, about the social network's policy permitting the video to be uploaded. After a day or so of impassioned debate on both sides, Facebook reversed its decision and took the video down. Needless to say, it is still easy enough to find online, especially in Mexico. There are numerous websites dedicated to uploading videos of "narco-killings" or executions similar to the Facebook example. Yet despite the fact the victim is clearly identifiable and that presumably someone somewhere in Mexico must recognise her - as their wife, daughter or sister - no-one has come forward to name her. As far as the BBC has been able to ascertain, there is no investigation under way in Mexico to establish the woman's identity, or find the culprits of her murder. "The place to start [such an investigation] is with the municipal police," says Dr George Grayson, one of world's authorities on Los Zetas and author of the book, The Executioner's Men, about the criminal organisation. The problem, he says, is that although many municipal police officers may work for the public during the day - and sometimes even that is questionable - at night they work for the cartel. As such, he says, fear is a powerful tool used by both the Zetas and their rivals. "People are reluctant to report crimes, even heinous crimes. State forces are not much better in terms of their corruption and their collaboration with the cartels." Meanwhile, the unfortunate lady in the controversial film continues to be nameless and with no known identity - a "Jane Doe", reminiscent of dozens, perhaps hundreds of others who met a grisly end on camera in Mexico. In the case of the Facebook victim, one is faced with an even more basic problem when trying to identify her. Based on the non-descript wasteland in the video clip, it is almost impossible to establish where in Mexico she was killed and therefore which local authorities are responsible for investigating her murder. In essence, the act could have happened almost anywhere in the country where there is drug-related violence. Los Zetas' and Gulf Cartel's areas of influence, Oct 2013 QandA: Mexico's drug-related violence Stratfor: Cartel influence map "This gets to the heart of one of Mexico's biggest dramas - and that's the issue of investigation," says newspaper columnist, Julian Andrade, who has also published a number of books on the drug war. "Remember that statistics show we have a 96-98% rate of impunity. The majority of crimes are never going to be investigated here in Mexico. This is the profound problem - that even high profile cases like this one which make an impact in the world's media still reflect the incapacity of the authorities to carry out investigations." The BBC was due to interview the National Security Commissioner in Mexico, Manuel Mondragon, to pose questions about security and the investigation into the beheading which appeared on Facebook. Despite repeated requests, the security commissioner's office has still not granted us an interview or made any comment on the video. It may be the case, of course, that the woman in the film was deeply entrenched in the drug war as an active member of the Gulf Cartel, as her killer intimated before the attack. But George Grayson says it is almost impossible to know for sure what her supposed crime against Los Zetas was. "Often these ghoulish events take the form of settling scores against someone who has offended Los Zetas or is in conflict with Los Zetas," he says. It's possible she was just a relative or friend of a member of a rival drug gang, and was killed for revenge. He recounts a story he has written about in the past in which a woman in Nuevo Laredo, said to be an informant, was allegedly beaten to death by the sadistic former leader of Los Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino or "Z-40", in front of an assembled group of corrupt policemen, sending out a clear message not to cross the cartel. "Twenty to 25 years ago, women were involved in the narco-trade but you typically didn't kill women. Now all the rules have changed and the Zetas have been the main impulse in changing the rules." Despite the reams of words written about the Facebook beheading video, seemingly no-one asked the basic question, "Who was this woman?" If her execution is now considered so normal in today's Mexico that it doesn't even merit an investigation, in the final analysis, it is perhaps this - rather than any decision by Facebook - that is the most "irresponsible" element of this brutal killing.

      <body>Depression is the second most common cause of disability worldwide after back pain, according to a review of research. The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other diseases and injuries as a cause of disability. Globally, only a small proportion of patients have access to treatment, the World Health Organization says. Depression was ranked at number two as a global cause of disability, but its impact varied in different countries and regions. For example, rates of major depression were highest in Afghanistan and lowest in Japan. In the UK, depression was ranked at number three in terms of years lived with a disability. Dr Alize Ferrari from the University of Queensland's School of Population Health led the study. "Depression is a big problem and we definitely need to pay more attention to it than we are now," she told BBC News. "There's still more work to be done in terms of awareness of the disease and also in coming up with successful ways of treating it. "The burden is different between countries, so it tends to be higher in low and middle income countries and lower in high income countries." Policy-makers had made an effort to bring depression to the forefront, but there was a lot more work to be done, she added. "There's lots of stigma we know associated with mental health," she explained. "What one person recognises as disabling might be different to another person and might be different across countries as well, there are lots of cultural implications and interpretations that come in place, which makes it all the more important to raise awareness of the size of the problem and also signs and how to detect it." The data - for the year 2010 - follows similar studies in 1990 and 2000 looking at the global burden of depression. Commenting on the study, Dr Daniel Chisholm, a health economist at the department for mental health and substance abuse at the World Health Organization said depression was a very disabling condition. "It's a big public health challenge and a big problem to be reckoned with but not enough is being done. "Around the world only a tiny proportion of people get any sort of treatment or diagnosis." The WHO recently launched a global mental health action plan to raise awareness among policy-makers. </body>

      <title>IVF success affected by ethnicity</title>
      <description>Asian and black women who have IVF are less likely to become pregnant than white women using the same fertility treatment, UK research reveals.</description>

      <body>Asian and black women who have IVF are less likely to become pregnant than white women using similar fertility treatment, UK research suggests. The Nottingham University team say they are unsure why this is, but say it could be down to genetics as well as social and environmental factors. They looked at IVF success rates for 1,517 women treated in their clinic. Live birth rates for ethnic minority women were significantly lower, the study published in BJOG found. Overall, 35% of ethnic minority women successfully conceived and gave birth after IVF compared with 44% of white women treated at the clinic between 2006 and 2011. This was despite all the women appearing to have favourable chances of having a baby, based on factors such as the quality of their egg reserves. The birth rate also differed between three ethnic sub-groups - 21.4% for Middle East Asian women, 23.3% for African-Caribbean women and 38% for South East Asian women - although this finding was not statistically significant. Lead researcher Dr Walid Maalouf said the reasons behind the findings were unclear. "Further research into genetic background as a potential determinant of IVF outcome, as well as the influencing effects of lifestyle and cultural factors on reproductive outcomes is needed," he said. The researchers say their findings could be used to help counsel couples about their realistic probabilities of success with IVF. Women from ethnic backgrounds might be encouraged to seek treatment earlier to improve their odds of having a baby, for example, said John Thorp, BJOG deputy editor in chief. The outgoing head of the UK's fertility watchdog has also called for greater clarity over the relative pros and cons of IVF. Prof Lisa Jardine said success rates were "discouragingly low" and that those providing the treatment "traded in hope". Two thirds of couples will not conceive after a cycle of IVF. </body>

      <body>A hospital cancer unit is being investigated by police after staff said they were being "pressured or bullied" to falsify data relating to patients. "Inaccuracies" were found with waiting time data relating to cancer treatment at Colchester hospital, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found. Patients' lives may have been put at risk, the hospitals inspector said. Essex Police said it was looking into whether a "criminal investigation" was needed. Staff told inspectors they were "pressured or bullied" to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines, the CQC said. The findings were reported to police "due to the serious failings identified", it added. Dr Gordon Coutts, chief executive at the Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust, said: "We are truly sorry that in some cases cancer patients, their carers and families have not always received the high quality of care that they should have expected from our trust." Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, recommended the trust be put into special measures, which could lead to a new management team being installed or another trust put in charge. He said: "It is shocking to think that people's lives may have been put at risk for the sake of the waiting-time figures." NHS England said it would lead an incident management team of cancer specialists to ensure the safety of cancer patients at the hospital. There will also be a review looking back as far as 2010 to check whether any other patients had their records changed or "inappropriately recorded". The CQC said its inspectors visited the trust in August and September after receiving complaints about waiting times for cancer treatment. It said some patients did not get their treatment within the required 62 days and in three cases delays exceeded 100 days. "Six people described problems experienced in their treatment, including delays in receiving care," the report said. "The provider did not have adequate systems to maintain the safety and welfare of cancer patients." The CQC identified 22 cases where patients experienced delays in their care. Essex Police said it had been contacted by the CQC and was "reviewing information" to "establish whether a criminal investigation is necessary". In a statement, the CQC said: "We found that the concerns raised by staff in relation to changes made to people's cancer pathways were not appropriately managed, investigated or responded to by senior staff of the trust. "Staff we spoke to provided examples of bullying and harassment by the management team in respect of changes of the cancer pathways. "We found that managers did not show clear leadership in a way that ensured the safety and welfare of patients by providing a high quality of care." Royal College of Nursing regional director Karen Webb said: "The CQC report concerning Colchester Hospital does chime with concerns we have voiced on behalf of nurses. "It is right that the hospital is placed in special measures." About 6,000 people a year receive cancer treatment at the trust. </body>

      <description>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest.</description>

      <body>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest. Early data, presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference, suggests a genetic test can tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours. A big challenge in treating the cancer is knowing whether surgery to remove the gland is needed. Cancer charities said a successful test would be a "game-changer". Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK. There are more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed and 10,000 deaths each year. The decision to remove the prostate is based on an examination of a tumour sample under the microscope. However, the procedure has significant side-effects such as infertility, difficulty maintaining and keeping an erection and uncontrolled urinating. One of the researchers, Prof Dan Berney, from Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC: "We need a better test as we are over-treating many men; most will die with, not of, prostate cancer. "We need to discriminate between the aggressive forms and those that will grumble along and just need monitoring." The commercial test, developed by Myriad Genetics but independently assessed by Queen Mary University of London, looks at the activity level of genes inside a sample of the tumour. If 31 genes involved in controlling how cells divide are highly active, it indicates the cancer is aggressive. Prof Berney said such information could "substantially change" decisions made by doctors and patients but the costs were "huge" and it was certainly not going to be offered on the NHS in the next few years. "We need to validate it and we're not there yet, but it is the strongest test we've had so far," he added. Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: "Developing an effective test to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer could be a game-changer for those affected by the condition. "We urgently need to reach a point where we can focus resources on saving more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year, whilst sparing the many others who needn't have concerns. "The results of this study are certainly intriguing, and take us a step closer to the diagnostic process for prostate cancer that men deserve. We will watch with great interest developments in this area." Dr Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: "Being able to tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours would help us take a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment. "Understanding more about the nature of a patient's tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side-effects, whilst also meaning that those who do need treatment receive it rapidly." </body>

      <description>Learning a musical instrument as a child confers brain gains that last long into adult life, according to a small study.</description>

      <body>Learning a musical instrument as a child gives the brain a boost that lasts long into adult life, say scientists. Adults who used to play an instrument, even if they have not done so in decades, have a faster brain response to speech sounds, research suggests. The more years of practice during childhood, the faster the brain response was, the small study found. The Journal of Neuroscience work looked at 44 people in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The volunteers listened to a synthesised speech syllable, "da", while researchers measured electrical activity in the region of the brain that processes sound information - the auditory brainstem. Despite none of the study participants having played an instrument in nearly 40 years, those who completed between four and 14 years of music training early in life had a faster response to the speech sound than those who had never been taught music. Researcher Michael Kilgard, of Northwestern University, said: "Being a millisecond faster may not seem like much, but the brain is very sensitive to timing and a millisecond compounded over millions of neurons can make a real difference in the lives of older adults." As people grow older, they often experience changes in the brain that compromise hearing. For instance, the brains of older adults show a slower response to fast-changing sounds, which is important for interpreting speech. Musical training may help offset this, according to Dr Kilgard's study. It could be that learning an instrument in childhood causes a fixed change in the brain that is retained throughout life. Or, music classes somehow prepare the brain for future auditory learning, say the researchers. Past work by the same team found younger adults were better listeners if they had been taught an instrument as a child. Experts also believe musical training - with an emphasis on rhythmic skills - can exercise the auditory-system. But these studies are all relatively small and cannot ascertain if it is definitely musical training that is causing the effect. Arguably, children offered the opportunity to learn an instrument, which can be expensive, may come from more privileged backgrounds and this may have an influence. </body>

      <body>TV chef Jamie Oliver has been honoured by GPs for his work in tackling childhood obesity. The Royal College of General Practitioners praised the 38-year-old who can now use the letters FRCGP (Hon) after his name. Oliver, who started his own campaign to make school dinners healthier, said he was "humbled" to receive the award. The chef, who already has an MBE, also championed a movement to get more people cooking wholesome meals. There are now seven Ministry of Food centres around Britain where people can learn how to make nutritious meals on a budget and are encouraged to pass on the skills. RCGP chairwoman Clare Gerada said the star was deserving of his award - the highest honour the college can bestow. Accepting the award, Oliver said doctors could help tackle the long-term, obesity-related issues which might not be resolved by politicians during their short electoral terms. "Governments, as wonderful or awful as they might individually be in their randomly changing roles, they are like ships that pass in the night," he said. "Sometimes if they get great they often move on and someone on their maiden voyage has to learn and pick it up from scratch again. "So actually GPs, chefs, the people that work in public health - they're the people that spend decades doing it. Hopefully between us all we can make a difference. "To make real change you need to be able to think 10 to 15 years in advance, not three. "I'm not a political expert but all I would say is that change requires that long-termism. When it comes to things like school food and school food education I don't think it should be political, it should be standard." Oliver grew up surrounded by good food: his parents ran the Cricketers pub in Essex and, from the age of eight, he started cooking and helping the chefs there, and learning to appreciate quality ingredients along the way. After an undistinguished school career, he decided he wanted to cook for a living and studied catering at Westminster Kingsway College in London. During his apprenticeship, Oliver worked with some of the best chefs in London. He then moved into TV, hosting the first of many cookery shows - The Naked Chef. </body>

      <body>Three carers mocked, bullied and assaulted elderly residents of a care home, a court has heard. The three female staff members deny abusing eight people with advanced dementia at Hillcroft nursing home in Slyne-with-Hest near Lancaster. One resident was slapped and others were mocked "for entertainment" between May 2010 and September 2011, Preston Crown Court was told. A fourth carer has pleaded guilty to ill-treating residents, the jury heard. Darren Smith, 34, of Howgill Avenue, Lancaster, was seen in bed with a distressed resident and has admitted abusing eight people at the home, the court heard. Katie Cairns, 26, of Riverview Court, Westgate, Morecambe, is alleged to have abused four residents - stamping on the foot of one and mocking others by throwing bean bags at them and touching them. Carol Moore, 53, of Ripon Avenue, Beaumont, Lancaster, is accused of abusing six residents - slapping one and throwing bean bags at others while laughing. Gemma Pearson, 27, of Hill Street, Carnforth, is accused of tipping a resident out of their wheelchair. The defendants told other carers they were bored and were doing it for entertainment, prosecutors said. All were charged under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 with ill-treatment and wilful neglect of a person with lack of capacity. They had previously been suspended from the home following abuse allegations made by a receptionist and a cleaner in September 2011, the court heard. But they returned to work after being handed warnings following an internal investigation and the matter was not referred to the police or social services. The court heard in December 2011 the Care Quality Commission (CQC) was sent anonymous emails about the standard of care inside the home. The CQC referred the matter to the local authority's safeguarding team who told police in May 2012. The trial is expected to last up to four weeks. </body>

      <title>GP 'computer support' to spot cancer</title>
      <description>A computer program could help busy GPs spot patients who might have cancer, say UK experts.</description>

      <body>A computer program could help busy GPs spot patients who might have cancer, say UK experts. It estimates the risk of five types of cancer, including hard-to-detect conditions such as ovarian and pancreatic cancer, based on symptoms. If cancer is a possible diagnosis, it alerts the GP and suggests more tests. Practices in England and Wales have been testing the software in a pilot scheme which is partly funded by the Department of Health. Macmillan Cancer Support, the charity behind the work, hopes the electronic Cancer Decision Support programme could be rolled out to surgeries across the UK from next year. Dr Rosie Loftus, lead GP adviser at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: "GPs have a vital role to play in ensuring that cancer is diagnosed at an early stage to give people the best possible chance of survival. "When you've only got around 10 minutes with each patient, it's vital that you ask the right questions and are able to quickly calculate someone's risk in order to facilitate an early referral." The program can estimate cancer risk for oesophago-gastric, lung, colorectal, pancreatic and ovarian cancers and alerts GPs to cancer risk as soon as a patient tells them about a symptom. For instance, if a patient visits their GP complaining of nausea and returns three weeks later with difficulty swallowing, the program detects that the patient could be at risk of oesophageal cancer. Prof Willie Hamilton, a GP researcher based at the University of Exeter, and one of those upon whose work the tool is based, said: "Despite the fact that more than one in three of us will be diagnosed with cancer in our lifetime, cancer cases are still relatively unusual occurrences for GPs to encounter during their day-to-day practice. "We've designed a system that doesn't replace their knowledge or training, but could be used alongside their notes to give extra information." </body>

      <body>Countries worst hit by the global financial crisis saw their happiness levels fall as a result, a survey has suggested. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), levels of "life satisfaction" fell sharply between 2007 and 2012 in countries like Greece and Spain. Trust in governments also deteriorated over that time. The OECD said the findings showed the far-reaching impact of the crisis. However, the UK saw its happiness levels rise 1% between 2007 and 2012, putting it in the 20% of happiest countries in the OECD, alongside the likes of Australia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and New Zealand. The UK also bucked the trend by showing a rise in trust in the government, up from 36% to 47% between 2007 and 2011. "The global economic crisis has had a profound impact on people's well-being, reaching far beyond the loss of jobs and income, and affecting citizens' satisfaction with their lives and their trust in governments," the 34-member organisation said. Greece saw average life satisfaction levels fall by 20%, while Spain saw a decline of 12%, and Italy 10%. Countries less affected by the economic downturn saw less of an impact on happiness levels. In Germany, life satisfaction rose by 4% over same five-year period. But trust in governments has been eroded across the OECD as a whole, with just 40% of those surveyed saying they now trusted their governments - the lowest level since 2006. The figures were derived from a survey which gauged quality of life under 11 categories, including personal security and work-life balance. "This report is a wake-up call to us all," said OECD secretary-general Angel Gurria. "It is a reminder that the central purpose of economic policies is to improve people's lives. We need to rethink how to place people's needs at the heart of policy-making." </body>

      <title>Families cut back on fresh food</title>

      <body>Many young families cut back on fresh fruit and vegetables and switched to less healthy processed food as the recession squeezed budgets, a UK study of 15,000 households' data suggests. It showed rising food prices and stagnating wages had led people to buy less food and choose cheaper products. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said pensioners, single parent households and families had the biggest drop in the nutritional quality of their diets. Food campaigners expressed concern. The Children's Food Trust said the move to processed food was a "huge worry". The report's authors used food purchasing data from 15,850 British households from 2005 to 2012, enabling them to analyse the impact on spending of the recession. They found that households spent 8.5% less on food in real terms across the period as disposable incomes failed to keep pace with rising food prices. People also swapped the type of food they bought, shifting from fresh fruit and vegetables to "calorie dense" processed food, with a resulting increase in saturated fat and sugar content, the Food Expenditure and Nutritional Quality over the Great Recession report said. Food prices rose by 33% between 2007 and 2013, official figures show. Butter, meat and fruit prices all increased by more than average while processed food rose by 28%. The IFS researchers found that on every measure, pensioner households, single parents and families with young children experienced a worse-than-average decline in nutritional quality. Pensioners tended to increase their purchases of fatty foods while households with young children chose more sugary products. IFS research economist Kate Smith, one of the authors of the report, said: "Over the recession households have responded to higher food prices and the squeezes on their incomes by switching to cheaper calories. "This has coincided with a fall in the nutritional quality of foods purchased, with moves away from fresh fruit and vegetables and towards processed foods. As a result, the average saturated fat and sugar content of food purchases has increased over this period." Children's Food Trust chief executive Linda Cregan said: "Feeding children well is absolutely crucial for their future health - these figures are an indication of just how tough this has become for many families in recent years. "Some of the trends in this report are a huge worry - we need to see the foods children eat containing less saturated fat, salt and sugar, not more." A second report from the IFS, looked at longer term trends. Between 1980 and 2009, households bought 15% to 30% fewer calories, but average weight continued to climb. During this time there was a big rise in snacking and eating out, but an even bigger fall in calories bought for the home during the 30-year period. "We were surprised to find that there has been a substantial decline in total calories purchased at a time when obesity has increased," said one of this study's authors Melanie Luhrmann. "This does not mean that poor diet plays no part in rising obesity. But understanding the interaction between diet and physical activity is clearly crucial." Both reports are being presented as part of the Economic and Social Research Council's Festival of Social Science in London. </body>

      <body>A senior doctor at a private hospital in north-west London has been jailed for two-and-a-half-years for killing a patient. Surgeon David Sellu was found guilty at the Old Bailey of manslaughter by gross negligence of a patient. James Hughes, 66, died in 2010 at the Clementine Churchill Hospital in Harrow, having suffered a perforated bowel after a routine knee replacement. Sellu ignored his condition and carried on with his clinic, the court heard. After Mr Hughes's knee operation on 5 February 2010, the retired builder from County Armagh, Northern Ireland, developed abdominal pain and was transferred to the care of Sellu. The Old Bailey heard he "simply ignored" the urgency of the potentially life-threatening condition and instead of operating on Mr Hughes carried on with his scheduled appointments. Mr Hughes died on 14 February. Elizabeth Joslin of the Crown Prosecution Service said Sellu's care "fell far below the expected standard, with terrible consequences". "This doctor's actions were not mistakes or errors of judgement but negligence so serious that he has now been convicted of a criminal offence," she said. Mr Hughes's widow Ann Hughes said the family had been subjected to a "tortuous purgatory" only brought to an end by "truth and justice". She said: "Our trust in normal processes, authorities and structures of society was shattered by the inexplicable, callous and deceitful actions of the medical profession entrusted with the most basic responsibility to protect human life." Sellu, 66, had denied gross negligence manslaughter. He was was found not guilty of perjury after he was accused of lying to the victim's inquest under oath. </body>

      <title>NI 'must stem junior doctor loss'</title>
      <description>The government must do more to stop junior doctors from leaving Northern Ireland to work abroad, the British Medical Association says.</description>

      <body>The government must do more to stop junior doctors from leaving Northern Ireland to work abroad, the British Medical Association (BMA) has said. It said part of the problem is that junior doctors working in the UK are facing increasingly challenging and highly pressured work environments. This forces some to move overseas where conditions are more favourable, according to the BMA. NI chairman, Dr Paul Darragh, said the drain on local talent is immense. "Our education and training is among the best in the UK. After spending a lot of money training up that pool of talent, eventually some leave to work elsewhere," he told the BBC. "Some of those young people reluctantly leave but conditions here are just too tough. "While doctors must be prepared to deal with the worst, the argument is that if more were employed per shift patients would receive an even higher standard of care and there would be fewer mistakes." Queen's University School of Medicine in Belfast is ranked as one of the best in the UK. Almost 84% of the students who graduated from the school in 2012 opted to begin their careers in Northern Ireland. Just over 12% of them took up employment in Great Britain while almost 2% secured jobs in the Republic of Ireland. However, evidence shows that several years after graduation, many junior doctors are moving away to work elsewhere, for instance, emigrating to Australia. Currently, there are 270 medical students preparing to graduate next year from Queen's University School of Medicine. One of the highlights of the Queen's course is the simulator exercise where final year students get to experience life on a virtual ward, as actors take on the role of patients. The 45-minute exercise begins with a ward round then the drama unfolds. In one scenario, a female patient who is a chronic asthma sufferer goes into cardiac arrest. The medical student is required to react as they would in a real life medical emergency. Chest compressions begin, chest x-rays are ordered, antibiotics are prescribed and nurses are given instructions. Not all necessarily in that particular order. The clinical director of the course is Dr Jim Murray. "We make students aware of what is going on around them. They shouldn't get too focused on one particular task and miss things in the wider picture," he said. "We teach them to be decisive, to prioritise, to ask for help to call for help when required - these are all human factors which are far more important in mitigating error or the effects of error," Dr Murray added. In cubicle three, the patient loses consciousness. He has been admitted to AandE after being hit by a golf ball. A student is tasked to find out what is wrong and to respond. Even though it is just a simulation, the effect is powerful. Among the students is Adam Gowdy. "Yes it's scary - but it's what I want to do," he said. "The whole point of our training is to prepare for this type of scenario - next year it won't be a simulator, it will be the real thing. "Yes that's scary but we are constantly training and next year will be shadowing junior doctors on the wards for 10 weeks." The BMA argues that the UK, and in particular Northern Ireland, trains the best of medical students. Therefore changes need to be made if the UK wants to retain them. Speaking recently, Dr Mark Porter, BMA Chair of Council, said: "Doctors in the NHS face increasingly challenging, high pressured and stressful work environments, often with limited resources and gruelling workloads. "Unsurprisingly, the result has been more doctors choosing to leave the UK to work abroad. In some specialties, such as emergency medicine, this has contributed to a recruitment crisis and means existing doctors have to work flat out to meet rising demand," Dr Porter said. "To stem this problem we urgently need to address issues around workload pressures, resourcing and work-life balance. Only by making working practices and environments safe and sustainable will the NHS be able attract and retain the best and brightest." Dr Murray said it is important to remember that the students are humans, not robots. "We are human beings, we all make mistakes but this is how we prepare them for the times when they will be stressed and interrupted. "This is excellent training among the best in the UK - but we must try and hang on to this great pool of talent." Dr Paul Darragh agrees. "The working conditions must be improved. Other countries abroad can do it - so must we." </body>

      <title>Health job cuts plan under scrutiny</title>
      <description>The head of one of Wales' largest health boards appears before assembly members to explain a decision that puts hundreds of jobs at risk.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-east-wales-24811641</url>

      <body>The boss of one of Wales' largest health boards has appeared before assembly members to explain a decision that has left hundreds of workers at risk of losing their jobs. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has to find £61.4m of savings in this financial year and a further £56.7 million in 2013/14. In June the health board announced plans to close almost 400 posts. Its chief executive Adam Cairns said it faced tough choices. He told the committee that due to the scale of financial savings required and the impact of staff pay on the overall budget, it would be "intellectually dishonest" to pretend there would not be an impact on worker numbers. Mr Cairns said only between 20 and 40 of the job losses would be compulsory redundancies and insisted that a constructive dialogue was ongoing with unions. He added that there was a need for a discussion across Wales about the terms and conditions of contracts in the NHS in Wales. But the Welsh Conservatives have called the plans "barmy" while the Unison union said any job cuts were "unnecessary". Cardiff and Vale is responsible for the University Hospital of Wales, Llandough Hospital and other units around the Welsh capital. In evidence submitted to the assembly's public accounts committee, the Cardiff and Vale board outlined plans to save money by: Members of the public accounts committee had the chance to question Mr Cairns on Tuesday. In the letter to the committee before the meeting, he said the health board faced tough choices as 45% of its costs related to staff pay. "This means that in order to manage in a flat cash environment with a national pay increase, continuing requirement to fund incremental pay awards and no changes to terms and conditions, either workforce numbers need to reduce or average pay needs to reduce," said Mr Cairns. Unison officials have organised a rally at the Senedd in Cardiff Bay against redundancies on Wednesday. A petition will be presented to the National Assembly calling on the Welsh government to oppose what petitioners describe as "draconian" cuts. "Our members are understandably concerned for their jobs, but they are also really angry that the health board has chosen to take this unnecessary decision rather than work in partnership to resolve this situation," said Mike Jones, Cardiff and Vale health branch secretary for Unison. "In a wider sense when you take into consideration the strains around staffing level, we have fears for the impact job cuts could have on patient safety. "NHS staff in Cardiff and Vale have been working hard to deal with the increasing pressure and demand on health services. "They should be applauded for their commitment and dedication to the NHS rather than told that they may lose their jobs or have their pay cut." The Welsh Conservatives have criticised the proposed job cuts and questioned their timing. "It's absolutely barmy to cut hundreds of staff at a time when waiting lists are rocketing and unscheduled care is in crisis," said the party's shadow health minister Darren Millar. "The board's report is extremely disturbing and will make worrying reading for patients." Tracy Myhill, deputy chief executive of the Cardiff and Vale board, said that although some 384 staff had been "potentially at risk" of losing their jobs back in June, action had been taken which limited the need for compulsory redundancies. This included redeploying staff into vacancies, redesigning services, voluntary redundancies and closing vacant posts where they were no longer needed. "We are confident that by the end of the year only a relatively small number of staff will find themselves in a redundancy position," she added. </body>

      <title>Time for MPs to snuff it out?</title>

      <body>It is said to offer a performance-enhancing pick-me-up for crucial Commons tests of mettle... or chemical consolation for those found wanting. But do MPs still need their supply of snuff? Under a tradition sparked when smoking was banned in the chamber in the late 17th century, snuff, or powdered tobacco, is distributed on demand and free of charge to MPs. Few partake nowadays, and for Green MP Caroline Lucas it has become an emblem of how Parliament remains tethered to a bygone era. "As I walked into the chamber today, I noticed the snuff box still provided for MPs by the entrance," Ms Lucas reported in 2012, during a debate on reforming Commons working hours. "I hope that members will take this opportunity to bring the Commons out of the snuff age and into the 21st century," she said. The sight of the snuff box - fashioned from wood reclaimed from the old Commons chamber, which was destroyed in World War II, and decorated with a silver plaque - piqued another MP's curiosity, and he tabled a written question in Parliament on the topic. Conservative MP for Gillingham and Rainham Rehman Chishti called on the House authorities to disclose how much snuff had been distributed to his colleagues in the past decade, and at what cost. "It is unusual for members to request snuff, and there are no regular users of this facility. No records of usage or cost are maintained," came the response. "Recent practice has been for this tradition to be maintained at the principal doorkeeper's personal expense." Mr Chishti told the BBC: "Parliament is full of these quirky and anachronistic rituals and procedures. "The last time this question was asked it was found that in 1989, 1.5 oz of snuff was being consumed at the cost of 99p. "The answer to my recent question appears to show that no one's really using it, it's not paid for by the taxpayer and it's therefore not currently costing very much money." Robin Fell, the current occupant of the principal doorkeeper post, described his snuff-distribution duties as a "great privilege" in a recent interview with BBC Parliament's Sam Francis - despite the apparent paucity of dabblers. "It may come as a surprise to some people, as it does to some MPs, that I pay for the snuff," he said. "A member may perhaps feel the need for a mild stimulant before he enters the chamber, or perhaps when he's leaving the chamber if he's had an unfortunate experience in there. "But it's not a serious drain on my emoluments, because when I took over the job, my predecessor left me with a nice supply of snuff and I haven't had to replenish it yet. "In due course, I suspect, perhaps next year, I might have to tootle off to a snuff shop, and purchase some." Martin Dockrell, the director of policy and research at public health charity Ash, commented: "It seems a shame for the poor doorkeeper who has to shell out from his own pocket for MPs' snuff. "But this tradition is a useful reminder of just how far things have changed. It used to be the sign of a good host to offer visitors tobacco and now it is the sign of a good guest not to smoke indoors - at least not without asking. "It is, of course illegal to give free samples of tobacco products so organisations should be wary of following Parliament's example, unless they share the immunity of a royal palace." There appears to be scant data on the health risks for non-smokers using nasal snuff, although an increased risk of cancer has recently been observed in smokers and ex-smokers who take the powder. Public Health England notes that similar products, such as chewing tobacco, are "known to be carcinogenic", and advises "strongly against use of tobacco in any of its formulations, including snuff". But Ms Lucas concluded that the Commons snuff supply was "perhaps just a faintly amusing anachronism, which falls into the category... of traditional things that are not harmful". The principal doorkeeper puts it pithily: "If members want a pinch of snuff, why shouldn't they have a pinch of snuff?" </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour.

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <body>Fears are growing about the sheer pressure of increasing patient numbers on the National Health Service, which could cause problems in accident and emergency departments this winter. Last week a National Audit Office (NAO) report said there were too many emergency admissions to hospitals in England, and the College of Emergency Medicine is warning a shortage of emergency doctors has the potential to put patients at risk. Speaking to the Today programme, Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's medical director, said: "I don't think we understand all the reasons why the winter made AandE busier than other seasons." He said: "One of the things we'll be considering in our strategy is that we need a better offer outside hospitals. "What we're really seeing is although this is manifest in AandE, this a problem with the whole system. Winter is going to be a particular issue," he added.

      <body>One year on, the BBC's Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth reports on his slow recovery from Bell's palsy, and frowns, almost symmetrically, at the lack of medical awareness about the condition. It may have taken a whole year, but the muscles on the left hand side of my face have been slowly drifting away from the picket line and getting themselves back to work. The strike, it seems, is over. My left eyebrow, the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do - smile and blink. Shortly after the onset of my Bell's palsy, in October last year, I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter. The response was overwhelming, with many, many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition. So, exactly 12 months on, by way of returning some of that generosity, this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets. Bell's palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight - and unwitting - members of a very strange club. There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they can't move half of their face. Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company, including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan, it is not a club that anyone would choose to join. The paralysis can be shocking and, socially at least, very difficult to deal with. The hardest part for me, as well as the loss of my smile, was the inability to close my left eye. Bell's Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open, unable even to blink, sometimes for months on end. Of course, the other, unaffected eye carries on as normal, merrily blinking away. So, for the record, my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought I'd been winking at them for the past year or so. Except the barmaid in the Nag's Head. That was a wink. The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting. With my left eye stuck open, the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same - in manic two-eyed stare - or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers. Move over Anne Robinson. Thankfully, as the above video shows, at some time between the six- and nine-month mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again. Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus, often at times of stress and lowered immunity, much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed. The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear. Signals then cease to be transmitted along it, paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless. The only treatment that has been shown to have significant, measurable benefit is a course of steroids, but it must be started early, within 72 hours of the onset. These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve. Remarkably, despite this clear evidence, a recent study has shown that many people (more than 40% in the UK) are still not getting the appropriate treatment. And the same study shows that Bell's palsy is more common than previously thought. The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than 7,000 new cases every day. One year ago, as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis, Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity, Facial Palsy UK, which campaigns for better UK services for Bell's palsy and a range of related conditions. "The information available online about Bell's palsy at the moment is pretty appalling," he tells me. "And there is very poor data because there is not enough research." The illness, he believes, is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis. But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take. One patient, a professional musician, is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone. Another, a receptionist, is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public. In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph. As one of the UK's leading experts in the treatment of the condition, Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases: Of course the two questions any new Bell's palsy sufferer wants answered are, "Will I get better?" and "How long will it take?" The good news is that most people make a full recovery - many within a matter of weeks. Something like 70% of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year. Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category. Even without steroids, as my own case shows, most people get back to normal. The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and, by the time I realised how important they were, it was too late. I'm left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them. I'll never know, because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they don't guarantee it. Estimates suggest that up to 30% of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset. Five per cent of sufferers will experience after-effects that are severe and long lasting and, as a result, face the possibility of serious psychological distress. "It may be even harder nowadays," Mr Nduka says. "Face is everything - Facebook, Facetime, Skype. We live in a very image-conscious age." As for me, well I'm almost back to normal, as you can see from the video. I've been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye. But recovery can continue for up to 18 months and the blink, being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve, is often one of the last things to return. Anyway, I'm not complaining. So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement, advice and good humour. You made a difficult 12 months so much more bearable. And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than they'd like, a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more.

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063</url>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <body>A recent Magazine article by Lisa Jardine about the frequency with which In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) fails prompted readers to send in their own experiences. Five million babies have been born worldwide since 1978 thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, said Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), in the article. Fertility problems are estimated to affect one in six or one in seven couples in the UK - approximately 3.5 million people . Around 60,000 fertility treatments are performed in UK licensed clinics per year, with the live birth rate after IVF about a quarter, according to latest figures (2010) from the HFEA. The latest HFEA figures show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients under the age of the 35 will be successful. And the percentages decrease as women get older. Moreover, costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics Here are some of our readers' experiences with IVF. Karen, Blackpool: I knew about my fertility issue as a teen and met my husband when I was 31 and living and working in France. We put our names down on the waiting list as soon as we could at a French hospital. As I had contributed to the French social security system, we did not have to pay for the treatment. However, we did have to wait four years and I was therefore 36 when I started treatment, by which time we had returned to the UK. Four donor embryos and nothing but empty arms. This treatment gave us nothing but false hope when we could have spent energy on other things at an earlier stage. Of course, you only get to hear the success stories. Thurstan, Farnborough: My wife and I are going through our second round of IVF after the first one didn't work. We got through to the very end successfully, but the final result did not happen. We have to pay for our treatment, yet if we lived five miles in a different direction we would have got it free. We are told the success rate - for us its 25% to 30% - and you do live on hope. It is absolutely crushing to find out it has not worked and nobody can tell you why. Another £6,000 down the drain and you are left with a devastated feeling. Joanna, UK: At 27 I was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, and then with signs of premature ovarian failure - with a three-year time limit for most women with my condition. The technology used in assisted reproductive techniques is ever changing. If we were to wait even just a year, our chances of success would potentially increase. But waiting wasn't an option for us. Without a crystal ball to see how technology will evolve, you're forced into an emotional "now or never" scenario. The first thing we did as a couple was to decide how many IVF attempts to make. We agreed three - the first ending in yet another miscarriage, the second ending in no viable embryos. The second round was by far the worst outcome. Sitting in the clinic car park having arrived a little early, we got a phone call telling us not to come in for what was our embryo transfer appointment, because there was nothing to transfer. No viable embryo. We didn't have the energy to go in for the testing results, we just went home. Even now, putting that into words is horribly difficult and not without pain. Awash with the IVF drugs, which are hormonally altering, you just can't trust yourself to be at your best to make major life decisions. A game plan becomes a must. Had we not decided upon a game plan, I think we would have become addicted to IVF and its offering of hope. Having a game plan was also necessary to make sure we were on the same page. It's a strain within a marriage, but we were fortunate. It's really a gamble. We've all heard the expression "that floored me'". The phone call that caused my knees to buckle, I crumpled in a heap of disbelief and tearful, shaking joy. That's the hope people are offered. J, Cumbria: I'm just about to start my second round of IVF, and as mad as it sounds I wish it wasn't available/invented. It gives you hope and you pray you are one of the lucky ones. It feels like a raffle - how many tickets do you buy? Gemma, Liverpool: At 29, having found out my fallopian tubes were blocked, I started IVF treatment only for it to result in a failure. We had been trying for nearly three years with one miscarriage, devastation and despair to show for it. It felt like we had to wait ages for the referral to the fertility centre, but in reality it was only about three months as I'd had a confirmed diagnosis. We were informed that despite the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stating that we should have three rounds of IVF, our primary care trust only funded two cycles. Straight away you feel under incredible pressure for it to work, as IVF can cost thousands of pounds at a private clinic - there is the worry of where you'd find the money (I work in the NHS, while my husband is a teacher). Arranging time off work, the endless appointments and the invasive treatment you go through in the hope that you'll get your dreamed for family out of it. It gave us hope that despite there being an issue with me, we might be able to have a family. Out of nine eggs, we only got four which fertilised normally, one was transferred and one was frozen. After the dread of a two-week wait, we found out that it was unsuccessful. I'd joined a support group and other women were announcing that their treatment was successful. It's horrible feeling guilty that you wish it was you experiencing joy rather than that woman, although you're so pleased they've been successful. We waited for months for a follow-up appointment, and it was decided that an operation was now my best option, with the possibility of removing my tubes - a scary prospect for any woman, but even worse when you know that's it - take them away and you've literally got no chance of falling pregnant naturally. Add in an extra wait for my operation, and by the time it came round I was a wreck. Amazingly, I didn't have to have my tubes removed. We were given the further hope that we might be able to conceive naturally, but if it didn't occur within a few months, there was still the frozen embryo. Imagine our surprise when four weeks after my operation my period was late. I'm now six months pregnant, and I still can't believe it, it still feels like a dream. Donna, UK: Several years ago, my husband and I embarked on consultations and investigations, then minor operations and IVF to be able to conceive. We had no choice but to go privately - at 34, I was the wrong age to get IVF on the NHS in our area. Having had the initial consultations and started a course of treatment we were told that IVF was not going to help us at all. In a way, we were lucky as our clinic was honest with us and did not try to "sell" us any more treatments or give us false hope - we had only spent £500. This enabled us to cope with the "loss" more easily at this early stage. Our expectations were well managed by our clinic, although I understand that this is not always the case. We have since gone on to adopt a beautiful boy who has made our family complete for the past three and a half years. I hated the invasive nature of IVF, and although I am glad we tried, I would never turn back the clock. We are financially secure now and would have had no savings for a rainy day if we had continued down the route of IVF. Beth, Sussex: Having been through IVF four times, I can honestly say that all these clinics are after is your money. I've never received a phone call or letter after a failed cycle. In fact, the last clinic in Brighton thought we had miscarried but my twins are now six months old. The clinic made no effort to contact us. It's shocking. Zoe, Bristol: I honestly believe that undergoing fertility treatment was the worst decision I have ever made. Before, I couldn't get pregnant because of a combined problem - I have polycystic ovaries and my husband has blocked tubes as a direct result of surgery as a baby - it was nobody's fault. I was 27 when we were referred, 28 when we first went to the clinic and 34 when we had treatment on the NHS. I was offered treatment again when I was 37, but couldn't go through with it. We needed a sperm donor just at the time the law changed on donor anonymity and the sperm banks ran dry - literally! I wrote letters and lobbied everyone we could think of to get treatment (at the time, there was no sperm for private patients either) and after two years our clinic managed to secure us sperm for three attempts. They all failed and in hindsight, I now know they had very little chance of success - funding meant we were offered a less superior form of treatment (and consequently a lower success rate - just 8%) and the clinic also made mistakes with our treatment regime. The pressure to go private was huge because the clinic couldn't offer the treatment we needed - they felt that the best option for us was private treatment and made this clear from the outset, but we couldn't afford it. At the age of 37, I discovered the clinic was able to offer ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) on the NHS, but I no longer met the criteria as my BMI was above 30. (If we had been private patients, BMI wouldn't have mattered). We were told from the outset about the failure rate and at every subsequent appointment. At times it felt that the clinic was only focused on the failure rate. The clinic counsellor only wanted to talk about failure which I felt was inappropriate in the middle of a cycle, whereas if I mentioned failure to the nursing staff, they always brushed it under the carpet, encouraging positive thinking instead. There was a lot of conflicting information - they would be happy to ram failure rates down your throat, but if you mentioned it, it was often glossed over. In the reception area there was a photo board of babies belonging to all the families who had had successful treatment - there was no mention of the other side. They didn't like it if I cried either - I was once told off for "snivelling" by one of the doctors. Undergoing treatment was difficult, but coming to terms with failure was much harder. Now the failure to get pregnant was purely my fault, something the clinic was very keen to reinforce - I was overweight, I had produced too many eggs, I hadn't taken my drugs correctly. Three times my body was fooled into thinking I was pregnant when no baby existed and I feel like I've had multiple miscarriages, except I haven't. I feel like I've lost a child, except I haven't. When people ask me about the worst part of infertility, I tell them it's the silence - they take that to mean that nobody talks about it and that is partly true, but for me, it's the silence which comes from the isolation and the lost friends who have moved on and had children. I no longer have anything in common with my peers. My mother-in-law recently told me that life goes on and it does go on around me, but life also stops with me - where there are no children, there are no grandchildren, no-one to care in later life, no legacy and that is silence which terrifies me. Fred, Whitby: There are unacceptable variations in the success rates of IVF. Living in one of the few areas of the country where IVF is not available on the NHS, we were forced to go private. Our options ranged from 17% at one local hospital, to 65% in a London clinic. We weighed up the options and, despite the significant extra cost and inconvenience, went for the London clinic. We knew we could only afford one cycle, but also that we didn't want to keep trying and failing. The difference was that it was in their interests to make sure everything was perfect before going ahead with the various procedures, as their success rates are their best advertisement. The local hospitals seem happy to press ahead, even when the body is not in its best condition to accept an embryo. Happily, we now have an amazing little boy. Karen, Cambridge: My husband and I went through five unsuccessful IVF treatments, and I have to say this was the worst period of my life. The drugs make you feel awful, it costs a fortune and the grief is overwhelming. All this happens in private, too, trying to carry on like nothing is happening. I went through an NHS hospital and two private hospitals and found very little compassion - we were just on a conveyor belt. We were told it was just "unexplained", but if we had been advised on more tests that were available earlier, we may have found a solution before it was too late. No doubt you will receive lots of nasty comments from people saying we should just adopt, or there are too many people in the world anyway - these usually come from people who haven't had to face that decision themselves and haven't really thought about what it means. Changes in the adoption process are, however, starting to make that a more viable option. Diane, York: I think it's quite naive to think that couples who embark on IVF don't know the odds of success. By the time they reach the decision of going down this route, they already know their chances are low. My husband and I certainly did. However, for us, it was a case of not looking back in 30 to 40 years' time, and saying that we wished we had at least tried. We were lucky, we are very proud parents of a lovely little boy at our third attempt, and we don't regret what we went through for one moment.

      <body>Amid the beeping of heart monitors, a more gentle noise can be heard on the wards of Great Ormond Street Hospital. The soft voice of musician Nick Pickett and the strumming of his guitar are entertaining the young patients in Bear Ward. All the children here are under three years old. Some are facing the long wait for a heart transplant and are being kept alive by the rhythmic beating of a mechanical heart. Sam Wallace's bed is surrounded by balloons, toys and other reminders of home. His grandmother, Viv Green, says the music has a transformative effect. "Oh, Sammy loves music, he has always loved music. "It just makes him happy. He will sing and dance. He loves to dance, he moves with the music as soon as he hears it and it just brightens him up completely - he's a different boy." But is the bedside entertainment having a clinical benefit on children such as Sam? Can a rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star actually help patients? A team at the hospital and University of Roehampton tried to find out. Thirty-seven children were played songs - including Five Little Ducks, See-Saw Marjorie Daw and Hush-a-Bye Baby - while nurses monitored their heart rates and assessed their pain levels. The impact of the music was compared with storytelling or just leaving a child alone. The results, published in the journal Psychology of Music, showed only music was reducing pain, slowing heart rates and improving the children's moods. "It varies from child to child. Not every child wants to have music but for those that opt to have music I think it's very important for them," said Dr Pickett. He added: "I think the most rewarding thing is if you are working with a child that is very distressed, a little one, and you go in, play some live calming, quiet music and watch the child go to sleep, that is great, it's the best reward." One of the study's authors, David Hargreaves, of Roehampton University, is a jazz pianist as well as professor of music psychology. As he sits playing a jazz interpretation of My Funny Valentine, he says the piece calms him down and makes him happy. He says that kind of connection with music is shared even by young children: "Lullabies are something that children are familiar with. They're intended by parents to be used with their children to create relaxation and remove tension." But is this just providing some evidence for what a lot of parents have realised for a long time, that singing to their children can soothe them? The earliest records of lullabies can be traced to Babylonian times. "I think it goes a bit further," he said. "We are beginning to work out what aspects of the music affects what aspects of the physical and psychological response. "Music has an effect on our thinking, our social behaviour, our emotions and our physical responses of course. What we are saying here is that children's wellbeing - their levels of anxiety and relaxation - are mediated by the emotion that the music causes." The brain has a complicated relationship with music. It is something Prof Tim Griffiths, a consultant neurologist with the Wellcome Trust and Newcastle University, has spent a career looking at. He says the brain is analysing the musical melodies and separately responding emotionally. "There are two parts to the musical brain. There is a part which processes sound patterns in the cortex and then there's a more ancient part of the brain which is responsible for the emotional responses to music." It is a process that he says begins in the womb, so he was not surprised that children can benefit from music: "What I think is happening here is that the emotional part of the brain is being stimulated by the music more so than the reading, and this is decreasing the arousal level of the children, and that in turn is affecting their pain response levels." The academic team admit their research is at an early stage, but are convinced music could end up playing a much bigger role in hospitals. </body>

      <description>Arts festival showcases the talent of people with dyslexia</description>

      <body>Dyspla is an arts festival that showcases the talent of people with dyslexia. This year they're going back to basics. All flyers for the November event openly and happily admit that they "may contain spelling mistakes". A particularly intriguing feature this year is an exhibition of handwriting to celebrate the unique way in which people with the condition put pen to paper. Many with dyslexia avoid handwriting, instead preferring to use computers with software which obliterates typical dyslexia errors. Lennie Varvarides runs the festival and has dyslexia herself. She is a playwright, producer and talent manager based in London. The weeklong event has been an annual fixture in the city since November 2007 but this is the first year it has received funding from the Arts Council. Dyspla goes beyond just one week, though. An offshoot, Sunday Surgery, is a monthly development workshop for dyslexic writers run by Varvarides. Throughout the year, playwrights are coached on how to get their ideas onto the stage without the anxiety of having to pen a lengthy script. In an interview with Ouch, Varvarides explains how she came to see her dyslexia as a positive and why she is so passionate about helping other people with the condition to realise their creative potential. How does dyslexia affect your life? I process information differently. Figuring out the best order to do something in, is sometimes not as obvious to me. When I wake up in the morning, I can't work out what to do first. Should I get my clothes and then go to the bathroom or should I go to the bathroom first and then go back to my bedroom and get dressed? I became self-employed because dyslexia made it really hard to be in a workplace. My managers made comments on my handwriting and didn't think how I organised my day was very practical. They said: "I want you to put in your calendar what you will be doing at nine o'clock, 10 o'clock." It was really difficult for me to plan out my day like that. Why did you start Dyspla? When I finished my Master's in writing for performance I thought, what can I produce that's unique? The only thing different about me was that I love writing and I'm dyslexic. Then I realised that that's quite huge. It's exciting to think about people becoming poets and playwrights when historically they've been told they aren't good at reading and writing. What is The Letters Project? It is our way of engaging with as many dyslexic writers from around the world as we can, without much funding. All we ask is that they handwrite a letter about their experiences of dyslexia or if that's too personal, pen a poem or short story. We accepted anything that was written by a dyslexic, without the use of a computer. All the entries are exhibited at the theatre and will be put on our website. Why do you want to exhibit handwritten material rather than word processed work? Because we want to celebrate our dyslexia, not hide it behind a perfect piece of text that can be produced on a computer using spellcheck and specialist software. You can't hide it if you write something by hand, because the result is wild and robust and heavy. The marks that you make when you are dyslexic, the relationship you have with that pen and that piece of paper, its individual, and it is obvious that there's a learning difficulty there. What is your own handwriting like? It is very squiggly. Another thing about dyslexia is that with our handwriting, the text will begin in one way and towards the end of the page, it changes. The dyslexia stereotype is someone who can't spell. Is that you? My spelling and grammar are awful. I miss out words and I write the wrong words. There's no punctuation. But you can still get the story. Kids are tortured in school for their bad handwriting or their bad spelling or not being able to learn punctuation and grammar properly. But you don't need all of these things to tell a story. The debate due to take place on the festival's opening night is titled dyslexia, help or hindrance. Which do you think it is? I am biased. I do think it is a help, that's why I'm so passionate about the festival. But I didn't know that until I became self-employed and started doing things around dyslexia. Until a few years ago, I hated myself for not being able to get along in the workplace, for having to struggle at school. I was getting frustrated because simple things were just impossible sometimes. The Dyspla festival has made a difference to so many people these last three years. I get emails saying: "I'm so glad you're running this festival. I've never told people that I'm dyslexic and now I feel almost proud." Stories like that make me realise that we are changing how people feel about themselves. Many are now calling dyslexia a positive gift, a sign of creativity. Is it? The two tales that go around when you talk about dyslexia are that art colleges are full of dyslexics and that prisons are full of dyslexics. There's a big difference between the kids that end up in prison and the kids that end up in art college but they share something. So it makes you think that if circumstances were different, then maybe more dyslexics who are low achievers because of their circumstances, could be playwrights and poets. There's a big divide between the dyslexics who get on and the dyslexics who don't and I believe that's all about opportunity. If a dyslexic comes from a really low-income household where their parents don't see any opportunities for themselves, let alone their kids, then dyslexia isn't going to be seen as this amazing wonderful thing. It'll be seen as another reason why that child will fail. Dyspla 2013 takes place from 11 to 17 November, at The Camden People's Theatre.

      <title>Four babies by two surrogates</title>
      <description>The couple having four babies by two surrogates</description>

      <body>A British couple are to become parents of two sets of twin babies carried by two Indian surrogate women they have never met. Experts say twiblings - or children born to separate surrogates but created from the same batch of embryos - are not uncommon in India. The four babies, all due in March 2014, are the result of a commercial surrogacy agreement with a clinic in the Indian city of Mumbai. The husband, aged 35 and wife, aged 36, who do not want to be identified, travelled to India in May following two miscarriages and several failed attempts at fertility treatment in the UK. "I thought to myself why wait and why waste any time and go through ups and downs and attempts again. We've had a long ten-year journey with this," he says. There are no official figures, but Natalie Gamble, a lawyer who specialises in international surrogacy cases, estimates hundreds of British couples travel to India for surrogacy each year. At the Corion clinic in Mumbai, the couple's eggs and sperm were fertilised to create embryos, which were then implanted in two different surrogates to increase the chances of a pregnancy. "We had six embryos in the fridge and typically you would use one surrogate, but I thought get me two surrogates and implant three in each," says the husband. A month later the clinic called with the news that one of the surrogates was pregnant with twins. They were both overjoyed. Days later there was another call from the clinic. "They found two heartbeats in the second surrogate," says the wife. "The clinic was panicking because it's never happened before," she says. "They asked us - is this what you want? Otherwise tell us now and we'll do the necessary." However, the couple say there was never any question of terminating any of the pregnancies. "Absolutely not, if there were three in each we would have had them." In a few months' time they hope to return to India to pick up their four babies. They will not disclose how much they have paid the clinic, however, a surrogacy package in India, on average costs from £17,000 ($27,500) to £20,000 ($32,500). They are grateful to the two women carrying their babies, but insist they have no intention of meeting either surrogate. "She's doing a job for us, how often do you communicate with your builder or your gardener?" "She'll get paid…we don't need to see her. As long as she's healthy and delivers my babies healthily, she's done a job for us," says the wife. Neither is daunted by the challenge of having four babies and both are confident they will be able to financially provide for them. For the professional couple from Bedfordshire, it is nothing short of an "amazing miracle". "For me to have four children, it's going to be the same challenge as the next person having one child. I don't know any different, I'm over the moon, I can't wait," says the woman. However, the case has raised concerns among health professionals in Britain. "It is troubling," says Dr Rima Rajkhowa, a consultant gynaecologist at Birmingham Women's Hospital. "I think patients who don't work in the medical field are not aware of all the risks that are involved with multiple pregnancies. All they can think of and are focused on is having a child and they want to make sure every step is taken to get to that goal." "I don't think any clinic in the UK will consider treating a commissioning couple with two surrogates simultaneously." It is a view shared by lawyer Natalie Gamble. "It wouldn't be allowed here. Under the regulation of licensed fertility clinics, there are quite strict rules about how many embryos can be transferred and certainly you couldn't transfer embryos to two surrogates in the same cycle," she says. The UK's regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), says that multiple pregnancy can increase the risk of stillbirth, neonatal death and disability for the child and complications for the mother including late miscarriage, high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. They recommend single embryo transfer always be performed, unless there is a medical reason to transfer more than one embryo. But how common is it for fertility clinics in India - a country where there are no laws governing surrogacy - to offer patients two or more surrogates at a time? Dr Kaushal Kadam, medical director of the Corion clinic, which treated the British couple now expecting four babies, insists it is not common practice. "It's usually a single surrogate but there are times when the couple want more," she says. But is it really that unusual? Several couples who have had babies as a result of surrogacy in India have said clinics offered them the opportunity of using more than one surrogate per cycle. Lawyer Natalie Gamble confirms there are similar cases but she believes it is a trend which is largely unique to the sub-continent. "We've seen it a few times. I wouldn't say it's routine but it's not massively uncommon in India," she says. In fact there is even a new term coined for these babies - twiblings. "They're not quite twins and not quite siblings either," she says. Medical experts believe twiblings represent a fertility phenomenon which has emerged as a direct result of India's estimated billion dollar surrogacy industry, an industry which critics say is driven by profit. Surrogacy in the UK is a legal and ethical minefield. There are strict laws governing it and commercial surrogacy is banned. Meanwhile, the Indian government is under increasing pressure to introduce laws to regulate the surrogacy industry.

      <title>VIDEO: Skunk dangers prompt health fears</title>
      <description>Skunk warnings not reaching young people.</description>

      <body>Skunk is the strong form of cannabis, high in the chemical THC, which has become increasingly popular with UK drug users. The drug is known to increase the risk of anxiety and paranoia amongst those who smoke it, resulting in an increasing number of referrals for mental health treatment. The number of people in treatment for mental health problems after smoking cannabis has gone up by a third in the past six years in the UK. David Manley from the Nottinghamshire Health Care NHS Trust says it is not unusual for him to meet young people who smoke 20-30 skunk joints each day. Peter Moyes, director of the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership, wants a clearer message about the health dangers associated with skunk to be given to young people. Inside Out's Sarah Sturdey meets two young adults called Jackson, 18, and Jacob, 20, from Nottingham who explain why they smoke skunk despite the warnings. Inside Out is broadcast on Monday, 28 October at 19:30 GMT on BBC One East Midlands and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter. </body>
