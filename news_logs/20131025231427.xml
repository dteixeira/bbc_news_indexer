      <body>Germany is to send its top intelligence chiefs to Washington to "push forward" an investigation into allegations the US spied on its leader Angela Merkel. The heads of foreign and domestic intelligence would hold talks with the White House and the National Security Agency, a government spokesperson said. Earlier, Germany and France said they want the US to sign a no-spy deal by the end of the year. EU leaders have warned a lack of trust could harm the fight against terrorism. As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the NSA has monitored millions of telephone calls by both German and French citizens. Spain on Friday followed Germany and France in summoning the US ambassador to explain reports of spying on the country. Italy has also expressed anger at reports it too has been spied on. US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki acknowledged that the revelations - most of them sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden - have "posed a moment of tension with some of our allies". "We are having discussions with those allies, those will continue, as is evidenced by the German delegation that will be coming here in the coming weeks," she said. Ms Psaki also said a review of US intelligence gathering, called for by President Obama, would look at how it affects foreign policy. The "high level group of outside experts... will consider as part of this how we can maintain the public's trust, how the surveillance impacts our foreign policy, particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public," she said. German government spokesman Georg Streiter did not give a date for the intelligence chiefs' trip to Washington but said it was being arranged with "relatively short notice". "What exactly is going to be regulated, how and in what form it will be negotiated and by whom, I cannot tell you right now," he told reporters. "But you will learn about it in the near future because we have created some pressure to do this speedily." Mrs Merkel made clear her anger at the allegations, which emerged in the German media, when she arrived in Brussels on Thursday for the EU summit. She told reporters after the first day that "once the seeds of mistrust have been shown it doesn't facilitate our co-operation... it makes it more difficult". She said they would be pressing for a "joint understanding by the end of the year for the co-operation of the (intelligence) agencies between Germany and the US, and France and the US, to create a framework for the co-operation". At a news conference on Friday she said both Berlin and Paris would, separately, be pressing Washington for a deal that is "clear-cut, in line with the spirit of an alliance". French President Francois Hollande said the aim of the initiative "is about knowing about the past and setting a framework for the future and putting an end to monitoring mechanisms that are not controlled". Observers say they may be seeking an arrangement similar to the 'Five Eyes' intelligence-sharing agreement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the UK's "unique partnership" with the US regarding security but backed France and Germany's position. "I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama," he said. A statement from EU leaders on Friday said the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership," and "stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism." But, the statement went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." There are reports that the NSA has monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. However, the White House says it has not bugged David Cameron's phone. National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said on Friday the communications of the UK prime minister "have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US". </body>

      <title>Sex charges for ex-Savile driver</title>
      <description>Ex-Jimmy Savile chauffeur Ray Teret is charged with historic sex offences involving 15 teenage girls, Greater Manchester Police confirm.</description>

      <body>Jimmy Savile's former chauffeur Ray Teret has been charged with historic sex offences involving 15 teenage girls, police have said. He was arrested by Greater Manchester Police (GMP) earlier this week when he answered bail in relation to a separate set of allegations. Police had said the accusations were not linked to the national inquiry into abuse by disgraced broadcaster Savile. The 72-year-old worked as a pirate radio DJ in the 1960s. He is charged with various offences including the rape and attempted rape of girls under 16 and of possessing an indecent image of a child. They allegedly took place between 1962 and 1996, primarily in the Greater Manchester area, GMP said. "This has been a complex investigation that was originally launched in October 2012 when an initial complaint was made to Greater Manchester Police," DCI Graham Brock said. He added: "It is now very important that we make no further comment and allow the correct legal process to take its course unimpeded and without prejudice. "We will continue to support all those women who have come forward and offer them whatever welfare they need through the use of specially-trained officers." Mr Teret is due to appear at Manchester City Magistrates' Court on Saturday. </body>

      <description>JP Morgan agrees to a $5.1bn (£3.2bn) settlement with the US Federal Housing Finance Agency relating to charges it misled investors during the housing crisis.</description>

      <body>JP Morgan has reached a $5.1bn (£3.2bn) settlement with the US Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) over charges it misled mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the housing boom. A separate settlement with the US Justice Department is expected to be announced soon. "This is a significant step to address outstanding mortgage-related issues," the FHFA said in a statement. It is the biggest settlement ever by a US bank. In a statement JP Morgan said the settlement resolves the biggest case against the firm relating to mortgage-backed securities. The bank added that the agreement relates to "approximately $33.8 billion of securities purchased by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from JP Morgan, Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual" from 2005 - 2007. JP Morgan purchased Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, and has tried to argue that it should not be punished for mistakes made before those deals. As part of the agreement with the FHFA, the bank will pay $4bn to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to settle claims that it violated US securities law. It will pay the agencies an additional $1.1bn for misrepresenting the quality of single-family mortgages. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the biggest mortgage lenders in the US. They received $187bn in US taxpayer aid to help them stay afloat during the financial collapse. They have since repaid $146bn of the loan. JP Morgan has been under investigation for several months by US regulators. The bank said that it hoped the settlement would be part of a "broader resolution" of the firm's housing bubble woes - a nod to an expected settlement with the US Justice Department that is also likely to run to several billions of dollars. The firm reported a rare loss last quarter, having set aside an additional $9bn to help it deal with its mounting legal troubles. JP Morgan has set aside a total of $23bn to help the bank work through its many investigations by regulators in the US and abroad. Last month, the bank agreed to pay more than $1bn to help it end various investigations into its 2012 "London whale" trading debacle, which cost the bank more than $6bn and raised questions about its oversight procedures. </body>

      <title>Syria Islamist rebel leader 'killed'</title>
      <description>Syrian state TV says the head of the al-Qaeda linked group al-Nusra Front has been killed, although there is no independent verification.</description>

      <body>Syrian state TV says the head of the al-Qaeda linked al-Nusra Front, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has been killed in western Syria. The report said he had been killed in the coastal province of Latakia, but there is no independent confirmation. A source in Latakia told the BBC that al-Jolani was believed to have left the area some time ago. Al-Nusra has emerged as one of the most powerful rebel groups since the uprising began in March 2011. It first announced its existence in a video in January 2012 and has said it was behind many of the suicide bombings that have rocked the country. The group is believed to have led numerous attacks against government targets, including the capture of a key airbase in the north. In response to the bombing campaign the US designated al-Nusra as a terrorist organisation. A source in Latakia told the BBC that contacts in al-Nusra had denied any knowledge that al-Jolani was on the front line on Friday. The source confirmed that al-Jolani had visited the front about three weeks ago but said he had since left. He added that rural areas of Latakia had come under intense shelling on Friday and that six people were killed and 10 were injured in the Al-Akrad mountain area. Fighters from al-Nusra were reported to be among some 20 rebels killed in an ambush by government forces near the capital Damascus on Friday. The ambush happened in the Eastern Ghouta region, scene of August's poison gas attack that prompted a UN Security Council resolution calling for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. State TV broadcast images showing bodies of men lying in an open area near a small river, along with scattered automatic rifles and hand grenades. A caption read: "Eastern Ghouta is a graveyard of terrorists''. The Syrian government brands all the rebels fighting against it "terrorists". "It was a highly accurate operation. `We will be moving from one victory to another," an army officer told state-run Al-Ikhbariya TV. UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 20 fighters were killed in the ambush but gave no further details. In another development, at least 20 people including children were reported killed in a car bomb blast in Syria, outside a mosque in a town in Damascus province. The blast, in the town of Suq Wadi Barada, came just before the end of Friday prayers and brought down the mosque's entrances. At least three children were among the dead and dozens more wounded, the Observatory said. State media blamed opposition forces, saying the bomb exploded while it was being assembled. However, rebel leaders blamed government troops. </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Unite has been accused of mishandling the negotiations, but the General Secretary of the Scottish TUC, Graham Smith said Unite officials were always prepared to be flexible but were hamstrung by the management's refusal to be reasonable. "I think they've been placed in a very difficult position by an employer who in my experience very uniquely walked away from its responsibilities that it had with the trade union, tried to impose its will on the workforce with a take it or leave it ultimatum," Mr Smith said. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <title>Welfare changes for disabled delayed</title>
      <description>The government's welfare changes for disabled people are delayed after ministers say reassessments take longer than planned.</description>

      <body>The government's welfare changes for disabled people in England, Scotland and Wales have been delayed. People will move from Disability Living Allowance to the Personal Independence Payment next week in only certain areas instead of the whole of Great Britain. Work and pensions minister Mike Penning said the process of reassessing people was "taking longer than expected". Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said it was the "latest example of chaos" in the department. Claimants will remain on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for the time being except those in Wales, the East and West Midlands and East Anglia who will transfer to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) from Monday if their conditions change. The government said the need for the alteration "only came to light at the beginning of October as a result of our ongoing analysis of the introduction of PIP" and this would ensure it could be handled "in a more gradual, controlled and manageable way". In a written ministerial statement, Mr Penning said: "Introducing natural reassessment gradually enables us to test the claimant reassessment journey. "This is in line with the way we have been introducing all our other programmes of change and we have made it clear that we would take a controlled approach to introducing PIP, learning lessons from live running." The government has said reform of disability benefits is essential because of the massive rise in its cost. Ministers point out that the number of people claiming DLA has increased from about one million to 3.3 million since it was introduced in 1992, and it costs the taxpayer £13bn a year. Ms Reeves said PIP followed the government's Work Programme and Universal Credit schemes in being beset by difficulties. She said: "The delivery problems we are seeing at the Department for Work and Pensions now risk descending into farce. But for thousands of disabled people who are already extremely anxious about the changes, this is no joke. "Not only is David Cameron's government out of touch but it's increasingly incompetent." Disability charity Scope said the move was just a "tweak" and still believed the whole reassessment process was "too blunt an instrument". The adjustment to the timetable will not affect people in Northern Ireland. </body>

      <title>Jack Straw to quit at next election</title>
      <description>Jack Straw is to stand down as Labour MP for Blackburn at the next general election, he announces.</description>

      <body>Jack Straw is to stand down as MP for Blackburn at the next general election. The former Labour home and foreign secretary, 67, was elected in Blackburn in 1979 and has stood in eight general elections in the constituency. He said his "love affair" with the town was "not going to end on 7 May 2015, nor is my connection with it." Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mr Straw's "eloquence and wisdom", and former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was a "true Labour giant". Mr Straw said: "Whatever national position I have held, the citizens of this town, and their children, have always been my first priority. "I am deeply grateful to everyone in the town for the faith which has been placed in me." But he said he had made the decision to stand down after a great deal of thought and consultation with friends and family. He added he "couldn't go on forever" and it would be "a terrible wrench" to stand down. Mr Straw held the positions of home secretary, foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons under Mr Blair. Mr Blair said Parliament would "lose one of the most able politicians of my generation" in 2015. He said: "Jack Straw is a true Labour giant. "I was lucky enough to have him in Cabinet throughout my time as prime minister, where he put his brilliant mind to work on two of the most challenging briefs: home and foreign affairs. "Jack's contribution to law and order in Britain and this country's standing in the world is quite simply formidable." In June 2007, Mr Straw was made justice secretary by Gordon Brown, a position he held until Labour's defeat at the 2010 election. Mr Miliband said: "Jack Straw will be greatly missed from the House of Commons. "On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to thank him for his nearly 35 years service as an MP, his achievements in government and his eloquence and wisdom. "He is Labour through and through, and always displayed this in his words and deeds. "He will be sorely missed but I know he will continue to serve our country in many different ways." Mr Straw practised as a criminal barrister before entering the Commons and was an adviser to Labour minister Barbara Castle, his predecessor as Blackburn MP. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Mosque bomber given life for murder</title>
      <description>Ukrainian student Pavlo Lapshyn is jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and carrying out a series of mosque bombings.</description>

      <body>A Ukrainian student has been jailed for at least 40 years for murdering an 82-year-old man and plotting explosions near mosques in racist attacks. Pavlo Lapshyn stabbed Mohammed Saleem in Small Heath, Birmingham on 29 April, five days after arriving in the UK. On Monday, Lapshyn, 25, admitted murder as well as plotting to cause explosions near mosques in Walsall, Tipton and Wolverhampton in June and July. At the Old Bailey, he was told he would be jailed for life. Mr Saleem was stabbed to death, just yards from his home, after attending prayers at his local mosque in Green Lane. Lapshyn, from Dnipropetrovsk in Ukraine, was living in Birmingham while on a temporary work placement in the city when he killed Mr Saleem, a grandfather of 22. He later planted three bombs near mosques in the West Midlands as part of a campaign he said was motivated by racial hatred. He was arrested almost a week after an explosion in Tipton. The third device, which exploded near the Kanzul Iman mosque in Tipton on 12 July, was packed with nails. Police said it was only because Lapshyn got the wrong time for Friday prayers that the blast did not cause mass injuries. Sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: "You clearly hold extremist right-wing, white supremacist views and you were motivated to commit the offences by religious and racial hatred in the hope that you would ignite racial conflict and cause Muslims to leave the area where you were living. "Such views, hatred and motivations have no place whatsoever in our multi-faith and multi-cultural society." He added Lapshyn held "views abhorrent to all right-thinking people which have no place in our multi-cultural society". During interviews, Lapshyn told police he had murdered the grandfather of 22 because he hated "non-whites". Prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the Old Bailey that PhD student Lapshyn had come to the UK on a work placement with software company Delcam. The firm's sponsorship programme in partnership with the National Metallurgy Academy in Ukraine is now under review following his crimes. Lapshyn's apartment, above Delcam's offices in Birmingham, were raided by police who found chemicals and bomb-making equipment for another three devices. They also discovered a camera containing 455 photographs and 98 videos. Some of them showed Lapshyn detonating homemade bombs in the Ukrainian countryside. The camera also included shots of him making bombs. The force's anti-terrorism unit also discovered apparent anonymous notes in the apartment which he planned to use to taunt police. One featured a photograph of the hunting knife, next to which Lapshyn had written "Mohammed Saleem was killed by". He also referred to a police reward for information, saying "£10,000 small price, maybe £1m", followed by a smiley face, and the phrase "white power". The court heard Lapshyn had a video game on his laptop called Ethnic Cleansing and also posed for white a supremacist website with the knife. Defending, Richard Atkins QC said "we accept that his crimes are grave" and "the appropriate penalty we submit is life with a substantial minimum term". Mr Atkins told the court that Lapshyn is being kept in segregation and that the only person he speaks to regularly is his father. In an interview with the BBC, Lapshyn's father, Sergey Lapshyn, said he did not believe his son was a racist. "Among his acquaintances were people of different ethnic backgrounds, and I have never seen that (racism)," he said. He added his son could be "a bit tight-lipped" but was not calculating, as police had described him. Speaking from his home in Dnepropetrovsk, Lapshyn's father confirmed his own mother was a Muslim during her childhood. Lapshyn's father said his son knew his grandmother was a member of the (largely Muslim) Tatar community at the time of the former Soviet Union. "We never discussed religious problems and we always considered them to be very intimate," he said. Mr Saleem's family said their father had not done anything to deserve to die, other than be a Muslim. In a statement read out in court, Mr Saleem's daughter Shazia Khan said: "The shock and sadness of the reality is impossible to accept, yet alone accept and move on. "We can't move forward, the murder has disabled our minds in every emotional way possible." Speaking after the sentencing, Assistant Chief Constable Marcus Beale from West Midlands Police said Lapshyn was "very definitely driven by an extreme right-wing ideology and white supremacist ideology". Asked to describe Lapshyn's manner in police interview, he said: "He was matter-of-fact, he was cold, he was callous. "I do not think he has shown any remorse or regret for the crimes that have taken place." </body>

      <title>Funds 'mismanaged' at free school</title>
      <description>Flagship free school Kings Science Academy in Bradford is accused of financial mismanagement in a government report.</description>

      <body>One of the country's flagship free schools has been accused of serious financial mismanagement. An Education Funding Agency (EFA) report reveals allegations of financial irregularities and even possible fraud at Kings Science Academy in Bradford. As a free school it is state funded but not under local authority control. In a statement to Newsnight the school admitted there were problems in the few months after the school was set up, but said those problems had been addressed. Kings Science Academy, which is a co-educational school for 11 to 18-year-olds, opened in September 2011 and was one of England's first free schools. Newsnight spoke to a former staff member and also the school's ex-finance director both of whom voiced concerns about the running of the school. It was set up by Bradford-born teacher Sajid Raza, also known as Sajid Hussain, who is now the school's headteacher. Mr Raza said he wanted to provide a first class education to some of the city's most deprived children. The school has been praised by Prime Minister David Cameron and Education Secretary Michael Gove, both of whom have visited it. Alan Lewis, a successful businessman and the Conservative Party's vice-chairman, was a key benefactor and supporter. And the school is built on land owned by Mr Lewis and leased to the academy by his company at a cost of £296,000 a year for 20 years. A draft EFA report was leaked to the BBC's Newsnight programme and the Department for Education (DfE) has now published a redacted final version of it on its website. In a statement attached to the redacted report the DfE said: "We found serious failings in financial management at the Kings Science Academy (KSA). We informed the police who decided no further action was necessary. "We required KSA to address these failings urgently. A plan is in place to recover funds and the school is undertaking its own investigation. Any necessary disciplinary action is a matter for the school." The DfE said that concerns about governance arrangements at the school had been flagged up to them by a whistle-blower in late 2012, and that they had examined the allegations on an already scheduled visit, arranged to look at the school's financial management. The findings of that visit combined with the school's own review of its accounting triggered a forensic investigation in early 2013, the DfE added. The school was paid a £182,933 grant when it opened in September 2011. The EFA investigation found that £59,560 of payments were not supported by any evidence of payments being made, and £10,800 of this was supported by fabricated invoices for rent. There was also a total of £26,775 which had been over-claimed against payments which had been made legitimately. And that therefore, there was a total of £86,335 which had not been used for its intended purpose. The DfE said that when the academy was spoken to about the discrepancies they were able to provide some evidence of legitimate payments which resulted in the total amount which could not be justified being reduced to £76,933. The DfE says there is a plan in place for the school to pay back that amount. The report also flagged up the fact that a number of Mr Raza's family members were hired to work at the school. His brother was on the board of governors, his sister was a senior teacher at the school, his wife also worked there and his father drove the school bus. Speaking on condition of anonymity a former staff member spoke to Newsnight about their time at the academy. "I think with the benefit of hindsight now looking back on it it's fair to say certainly the key decisions or the key power and authority was based around his family," they said. The EFA report does not say whether Mr Raza's family members were appointed through the usual processes or not. However, it did flag up that some staff were appointed without interviews. "We were informed that a small number of staff were employed by the academy without applying for posts, although they were interviewed by the governing board members to ensure their suitability," the report said. The school's former finance director Daud Khan also spoke to Newsnight. "Sajid would do a lot of things behind closed doors. He wouldn't get me involved or anybody else. And I don't know how much he was telling the governors and even if he was telling them the majority of them were all their friends anyway, so they would back him up," Mr Khan said. A statement issued on behalf of Mr Raza and the school said that the issues raised by Newsnight related to a period two years ago. "We acknowledge that there were poor governance issues during the start-up due to the pace of setting the new school up in two to three months," it said "These have since been addressed with the support of external auditors and accountants Deloittes and Crowe Clark Whitehill. All payments received from the DfE have been fully accounted for by the academy and any sums incorrectly claimed have been repaid." It added that the latest reviews by the local authority had been positive. A statement issued by Mr's Lewis' company said: "His contribution to the academy has been that of a benefactor. At no time has Mr Lewis had responsibility for the financial management of the academy." </body>

      <body>Warnings of stormy weather in England and Wales on Sunday night and Monday have been extended to more areas. A Met Office amber alert of high winds in southern Wales and southern England now includes much of the Midlands, the East, and London and the South East. People are being warned of the risk of falling trees and damage to buildings, with gusts of up to 80 mph (120 kph), possibly higher around exposed coasts There is also concern heavy rain could cause surface water flooding. A yellow alert predicting heavy rain on Monday covers the whole of England and Wales. It is the lowest level of the three warnings issued by the Met Office, and advises people to "be aware". An amber alert, advising people to "be prepared" for potentially hazardous conditions, is one level up from this. BBC Weather presenter Peter Gibbs said a strong Atlantic jet stream is providing the "driving force" for the storm, which is expected to hit central England and Wales UK late on Sunday night and run across the country in a north-eastwardly direction. The strongest winds are expected on the storms southern and western flanks. Forecasters say a "very intense low pressure system" brings the potential for strong winds, especially on exposed coasts in Cornwall, Devon, Dorset, Hampshire, West Sussex, East Sussex and Kent. Temperatures of up to 15C on Monday will be above average. The Met Office said "the public should be prepared for the risk of falling trees as well as damage to buildings and other structures, bringing disruption to transport and power supplies". But there is still some uncertainty as to exactly when the storm will reach the country. Eddy Carroll, chief forecaster at the Met Office, said: "This storm doesn't exist at the moment, but our forecast models predict it is likely to develop in the west Atlantic on Saturday. "Then it's likely to rapidly intensify just west of the UK late on Sunday before tracking across England and Wales early on Monday. "There is still a chance this storm may take a more southerly track and miss the UK, bringing impacts elsewhere in northern Europe, but people should be aware there is a risk of severe weather and significant disruption." The AA said stormy conditions could cause "significant travel disruption on Monday morning... one of the busiest times on the roads". Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: "Strong wind and torrential rain is an unpredictable and hazardous combination, which can be quite overwhelming when you're driving. "There's likely to be tree and other debris on the roads as well potential flooding, so it's very important to keep your speed down and drive with great care." There is more information about the forecasts for Sunday and Monday on the BBC Weather and Met Office websites.

      <title>Man denies owning 3D printer gun</title>
      <description>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun says the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever".</description>

      <body>A man suspected of possessing a 3D printer with component parts to make a gun said the seized equipment had "nothing to do with a gun whatsoever". It follows police raids in Greater Manchester on Thursday, in which officers seized computer equipment. The arrested man said the suspicious parts were simply parts for the 3D printer. Experts have also cast doubts on the claims, saying the parts were not sophisticated enough to make a gun. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. Greater Manchester Police said the components had been sent to the National Ballistics Service for further examination. The results are expected in the next few days. The force said it "cannot categorically say" whether they had recovered the component parts that could make a "viable" gun. US based printer maker, MakerBot Industries, which makes the components, said the company had examined the photographs. Jennifer Howard, the firm's director of PR, said: "We've seen the photographs and they definitely look like parts for the printer. "The first one looks like a pin that goes with an extruder upgrade - there is an upgrade kit that is available to make your printer work better. "The second looks like a filament spool, certainly that is what people who 3D print recognise it as." Brian Derby, professor of material science at Manchester University, said the printer was a "hobbyist's machine". He said: "It would make something that would look like a gun but it would not work as a gun." "You would have to buy an expensive machine for about £50,000 but you could get a real gun. "What is made is not likely to work. It is dangerous and likely to harm the person using it." The arrested man, who does not want to identified, was held following a police raid in Wythenshawe. "I have no idea why they think it is part of a gun," he said. "It's designed by the company that makes the printer to go in the printer to make it better." Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, who is a member of the national firearms group, said: "What I would say is that its actually incredibly difficult to create the whole weapon. "And even if you do create the weapon its still incredibly difficult to fire it because it tends to blow up in your face." He said officers were "absolutely legitimate to get a warrant from the magistrate go in and do the search that we did". A GMP spokesman earlier said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". Asst Ch Con Heywood said: "We need to be absolutely clear that at that this stage, we cannot categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3D gun. "What we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine, viable firearm." "It is prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat." The raid was part of GMP's Operation Challenger, which aims to "dismantle" organised criminal gangs. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the high street for less than £1,000, but prices can be as high as £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>A monkey that escaped from Belfast zoo has been recaptured, after zoo staff shot it with a tranquilliser gun. The animal fell from a tree after it was sedated by zoo staff at Gideon's Green in Newtownabbey, County Antrim. A hydraulic lift, supplied by the fire service, was used to help zoo keepers reach the monkey in the trees. It was one of six lion-tailed macaques that escaped from the zoo on Monday. Five have now been recaptured but one monkey is still missing. Up to 12 zoo staff arrived in Gideon's Green after the monkey was spotted up a tree on Friday afternoon. A large crowd gathered to watch their attempts to capture the animal. The missing macaques had been spotted several times in the north Belfast and Newtownabbey areas over recent days. On Thursday, one of the monkeys was captured by zoo keepers in the grounds of Belfast Castle. Another escaped macaque scaled a "peace line" fence outside a primary school in Newtownabbey. It was spotted, perched on the peace line, during the school run on Thursday morning. Children at Hazelwood Integrated primary school, on the Whitewell Road, enticed the monkey down from the fence by offering it bananas. However, the animal took the bananas and escaped before zoo staff arrived. </body>

      <body>Troubled Sunderland may have been anything but infallible this season, but one man appears to be keeping the faith. Pope Francis has been given a personalised Black Cats shirt ahead of this weekend's derby clash with arch-rivals Newcastle United. The shirt was presented to him by Father Marc Lyden-Smith, who is Sunderland Football Club's chaplain. He is in Rome with Bishop Seamus Cunningham and a group of pilgrims. Fr Lyden-Smith said: "We have 60 pilgrims from the North East in Rome at the moment visiting churches and shrines. As part of the pilgrimage we took part in the papal audience on Wednesday morning. "As chaplain of Sunderland Football Club, they asked if I could present him with a shirt that had his name on the back - Papa Francesco. "It was a bit of a miracle really. There were 120,000 people gathered in the square. We managed to get tickets up at the front and the pope was guided towards us. "Some people from the North East managed to shake his hand and then I asked if he would accept the shirt and he took it and waved it in the air to cheers." Asked if the pope would be supporting the team against fierce rivals Newcastle United at Sunderland's Stadium of Light on Sunday, he said: "He is very diplomatic and wouldn't say that. "He's a keen football fan - he was a season ticket holder before he was elected as pope." </body>

      <title>Apprenticeship company going under</title>
      <description>A training company that has received more than £100 million in public money for apprenticeships and training is going into administration.</description>

      <body>A private training company that received more than £100 million in public money to provide apprenticeship and vocational training is going into administration, the BBC understands. Elmfield Training, based in Warrington, employs 600 people. The company said it was trying to prevent job losses. A BBC Newsnight investigation found employees were routinely asked to alter forms to claim funding for staff who never wanted to do an apprenticeship. An investigation by the Skills Funding Agency, which pays for apprenticeship training, is still ongoing. The majority of government funding received by Elmfield was paid to train apprentices for a single employer, Morrisons supermarket. That contract has earned Elmfield more than £60 million since 2010. In July, an Ofsted inspection awarded Elmfield a grade 4 - the lowest grade possible - for the Morrisons training. The Ofsted report said: "Success rates in the apprenticeship programmes experienced a considerable decline last year and a high proportion of learners within the Morrisons contract did not complete the full framework. "Furthermore, the number of learners who completed their apprenticeship in the planned time fell to an unacceptably low level of 33%." Newsnight subsequently spoke to two former assessors for Elmfield who had worked on the Morrisons contract. They said they were not surprised at the low completion rate and they were routinely asked to change documents to claim government funding for Morrisons staff who did not want to do the English or maths training required to complete an apprenticeship. Their claims were backed up by an internal email trail seen by Newsnight. In one email, assessors were told: "For audit purposes we cannot use the words 'reluctant' or 'declined' for obvious reasons." Another email said: "We need to address and cleanse the 1,700 learners that are currently on the system as funded Apprentices. "These learners were originally on the system as unfunded due to not wanting to complete the Key Skills." One of the former employees, speaking anonymously, said: "It's an abuse because the learners shouldn't have been signed up at all. "If the funding isn't there to just deliver the main qualification then it wasn't suitable for them." Morrisons switched from Elmfield to another training provider in August. On the same day that Newsnight presented its evidence to Elmfield's owner, Ged Syddall, he resigned as a company director. "Mr Syddall will have no further role in or influence on the operations of the business, its governance or its relationships with clients," said the company. The Board described the alleged behaviour revealed by Newsnight as "unacceptable". Mr Syddall had previously come under fire for taking a dividend of nearly £3 million from Elmfield in the first year of the Morrisons contract. In 2012 he took a dividend of nearly £1 million, at the same time as Elmfield posted a £5 million loss. The Skills Funding Agency said it offered advice on different training providers. "In cases where a provider enters administration, the Agency responds by identifying potential alternative providers. "If necessary, we manage the transfer of learners and employers to new providers. "We also redistribute funding as effectively and efficiently as possible to ensure that learners and public funds are protected." </body>

      <body>A spat between two former Conservative leaders continues after Iain Duncan Smith mocked Sir John Major's support for a "cones hotline" in the 1990s. Relations between the two men have been cool ever since Mr Duncan Smith led opposition to Sir John over the Maastricht Treaty on EU integration. On Tuesday, Sir John took a swipe at Mr Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, saying his "genius was unproven". Now Mr Duncan Smith has hit back in an interview in the Evening Standard. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mr Duncan Smith told the newspaper. "Well, as I say, I never really get too fussed about what people think about their own intellects. "I'm always happy to be in awe of someone whose own intellect delivered us the cones hotline, I must say." The cones hotline - a telephone number for motorists to ring if they were irritated by unattended road works - was one of the most mocked policies of the Major government. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith insisted to the BBC it was a throw away line and meant as a joke. There has been little love lost between the two men since, as a backbencher in the early 1990s, Mr Duncan Smith was one of a group of rebels who fought a long parliamentary campaign against the Major government's decision to sign up to the Maastricht Treaty - regarded as a landmark moment in European integration. The battles, which resulted in the Major government facing a confidence vote in the House of Commons, undermined Sir John's authority and led to the prime minister calling his opponents "bastards". He repeated the phrase in a speech to an audience of political journalists on Tuesday, saying his use of the word was "unacceptable" but "his only excuse was that it was true". In the speech, Sir John also questioned the likely outcome of Mr Duncan Smith's sweeping programme of welfare changes. "Iain Duncan Smith is trying to reform benefits," he said. "I truly wish him well. But it is enormously complicated and unless he is very lucky, which he may not be, or a genius, which the last time I looked was unproven, he may get some of it wrong." Mr Duncan Smith's Universal Credit is seen as one of the most ambitious, and potentially risky, policies the coalition has embarked upon. Chancellor George Osborne has denied reports in a recent book by the journalist Matthew D'Ancona that he had questioned whether Mr Duncan Smith had the intelligence to run a major department like work and pensions. Referring to the matter recently at the Tory conference, Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that both Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher had had their intellect questioned but had proved their doubters wrong. And Mr Duncan Smith told the Evening Standard on Friday: "I never make any claims for myself, I just say I think we should all look at each other and be a little more pleasant." </body>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <body>Teachers in England are to suspend a planned national strike after ministers agreed to discuss the dispute. Two of the biggest teaching unions, the National Union of Teachers and the NASUWT, had planned to stage a one-day walkout before Christmas in a row over pay, pensions and conditions. But they say a strike will be held by 13 February next year if the talks do not lead to progress. It comes after a series of regional strikes by teachers this year. In a statement, the unions announced Education Secretary Michael Gove had said he was "willing to discuss a basis for genuine talks". Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT, said: "The public demonstration of the anger and frustration of teachers and the commitment of members to the action have secured the prospect of talks with the secretary of state. "We look forward to securing progress in these talks as quickly as possible." Christine Blower, general secretary of the NUT, said: "The successful regional strikes already undertaken show the strength of teachers' anger and concerns about the changes being made to their profession. "We are giving government the opportunity to engage in meaningful discussions with us to resolve our ongoing dispute. "We have always been available for such negotiations and would have preferred that this was a route the government had gone down sooner rather than later." Teachers are objecting to proposals by Mr Gove to bring in performance-related pay, make changes to their pensions and other changes which they say will increase their workloads. The first walkout was at the end of June in the north-west of England. Unions said 2,765 schools close or partially shut, across 22 authorities were affected. A strike on 1 October saw 2,500 schools affected across 49 authorities in the east of England, the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber. The most recent walkout on 17 October involved 3,5000 schools in London, Cumbria, the South East, North East and South West. </body>

      <body>The adult-themed crime game, Grand Theft Auto 5, has won the top prize at the Golden Joystick awards. Rockstar's controversial game - where players commit crime in the fictional city of Los Santos - was presented with the Game of the Year gong at a ceremony in central London. Sony's The Last of Us also scooped two awards. Ken Levine - the man behind Bioshock and System Shock 2 - was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. The Golden Joysticks are the largest publicly-voted video game awards in the world, with this year more than 10 million people casting a vote. The Lifetime Achievement is a new addition to the ceremony. Mr Levine has been a high profile figure in the industry ever since he worked with designer Doug Church, on the first-person shooter, Thief: The Dark Project, credited with being one of the first titles to introduce the concept of stealth into video games. "The great thing about the still-maturing nature of video games is you get to be inspired by the work of novices and veterans alike," he said. "We're all figuring out day by day exactly what the medium is capable of." Now in its 31st year, the awards were first given out back in 1983, with the first Game of the Year award going to Jet Pac on the ZX Spectrum. Andy Robinson, editor of Computer and Videogames, said that three decades on, the awards still "represent the voice of gamers worldwide". "We've revamped the categories to reflect the diversity of modern gaming and also added the inaugural Lifetime Achievement award, which has made this year's ceremony the most thrilling for us yet," he said. The Golden Joysticks are not the only big awards for the video games industry. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts hands out its Video Game Baftas in the spring each year, although the majority of their awards are selected by a panel of experts, rather than a public vote. Grand Theft Auto 5, released last month, quickly became the fastest selling entertainment product ever, taking just three days to generate $1bn (£620m) in revenue. </body>

      <title>Dino impact 'also destroyed bees'</title>

      <body>Scientists say there was a widespread extinction of bees 66 million years ago, at the same time as the event that killed off the dinosaurs. The demise of the dinosaurs was almost certainly the result of an asteroid or comet hitting Earth. But the extinction event was selective, affecting some groups more than others. Writing in Plos One journal, the team used fossils and DNA analysis to show that one bee group suffered a serious decline at the time of this collision. The researchers chose to study bees within the subfamily known as Xylocopinae - which included the carpenter bees. This was because the evolutionary history of this group could be traced back to the Cretaceous Period, when the dinosaurs still walked the Earth. Previous studies had suggested a widespread extinction among flowering plants during the Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction event 66 million years ago. And it had long been assumed that the bees that depended upon these plants would have met the same fate. Yet, unlike the dinosaurs, "there is a relatively poor fossil record of bees," said the paper's lead author Sandra Rehan, a biologist at the University of New Hampshire in Dunham, US. This has made the confirmation of such an extinction difficult. However, the researchers were able to use an extinct group of Xylocopinae as a calibration point for timing the dispersal of these bees. They were also able to study flower fossils that had evolved traits that allowed them to be pollinated by bee relatives of the Xylocopinae. "The data told us something major was happening in four different groups of bees at the same time," said Dr Rehan. "And it happened to be the same time as the dinosaurs went extinct." The findings of this study could have implications for today's concern about the loss in diversity of bees, a pivotal species for agriculture and biodiversity. "Understanding extinctions and the effects of declines in the past can help us understand the pollinator decline and the global crisis in pollinators today," Dr Rehan explained. </body>

      <body>It is a year to the day since the news that ash dieback had been found in Britain's native woodland was officially confirmed. The announcement sparked a deal of hand wringing and some dire predictions - it would be Armageddon in the countryside, as the disease that had decimated European forests let rip in this green and pleasant land. It was even claimed that a third of Britain's trees might be lost in little more than a generation. The Today programme's science correspondent Tom Feilden investigates what actually happened, and what, if anything, we do about it.

      <body>Actors David Tennant and Olivia Colman have helped ITV's Broadchurch win four prizes - dubbed the Daggers - at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards. The pair picked up the best actor and actress awards for their roles in the drama, with co-star Andrew Buchan named best supporting actor. Broadchurch also won the TV prize, with Bond movie Skyfall named best film. Martina Cole and Wilbur Smith were also inducted into the Crime Writers' Association Hall of Fame at the event. The pair were honoured in recognition of their contributions to the genre. The awards - which marked the culmination of ITV3's Crime Thriller Book Club - included a new award for the club's best read, which went to Malcolm MacKay for The Necessary Death Of Lewis Winter. After beating books by Linwood Barclay, Megan Abbott, Christopher Fowler, Diana Bretherick and Andrew Taylor, the author said it was "a huge honour and thrill to win". Mick Herron picked up the coveted Gold Dagger award for best crime novel of the year for Dead Lions. "My shelves are crammed with Gold Dagger-winning novels of the past - The Mermaids Singing, Black and Blue, Bones and Silence. I can't quite believe I get to put my own book next to them," he said. The best new crime writer prize went to Derek B Miller for his debut novel Norwegian By Night Roger, while Roger Hobbs's Ghostman was named best thriller of the year. Other awards went to Amelia Bullmore, who won best supporting actress for her role in ITV's Scott and Bailey, while Danish series The Killing III won the best international TV prize.

      <title>IVF and the marketing of hope</title>
      <description>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine.</description>

      <body>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Modern medicine can achieve extraordinary feats in repairing and protecting the human body, from hip replacements to life-extending cancer treatments. But for most of us, I think, there are two areas of medical intervention that have a very special status and deserve the closest ethical attention: birth and death, the creation of life and its termination. Just such close scrutiny was given to an amazing breakthrough in the treatment of infertility - the birth of the first "test tube baby", Louise Brown, in Oldham in 1978. As further successful IVF births followed, it was quickly decided by the British government that some sort of ethical and legal oversight was needed. Treating infertility by combining egg and sperm outside the womb, and then replacing the resulting embryo in the mother, was an established clinical reality. The question was, is it ethically acceptable to carry out the procedure, and what limitations and controls should be placed upon it to satisfy public concern? In summer 1984, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology - the Warnock Report - was published. The task of the committee had been "to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of recent, and potential developments in the field of human assisted reproduction". The report highlighted the "special status" of the human embryo, and proposed the establishment of a regulator. The legislation derived from the report continues to govern In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) in the UK 30 years later under that regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA. PDF download The Warnock Report[770KB] Dame Mary Warnock - now Baroness Warnock - turned out to be the ideal person to steer the public moral debate on IVF. As commentator Andrew Brown wrote in 2003: "Her distrust of grand schemes and theories [made] her much in demand as a kind of philosophical plumber to the establishment - whenever some tricky problem arose, she could be trusted to get things flowing again." Born into an old-fashioned, well-to-do family, Warnock studied Classics at Oxford, and became a lecturer in philosophy at St Hugh's College in 1949. Turning her attention to schooling after the birth of her five children, she became head of Oxford High School in 1966, and spent six years championing girls' secondary education. In the 1970s, she moved into public life and began to demonstrate her considerable skills as a committee chair capable of dealing with tricky political and ethical issues. She chaired a Home Office Commission of Inquiry into the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and a government commission on the education of children with special needs. Her clear-headedness and keen intellect helped dissect the issue and structure the agenda in whatever controversial arena she engaged in. These talents were complemented by her administrative skill, and her shrewd grasp of politics. She knew which recommendations would work administratively while being politically workable too. Even she probably did not anticipate the furore the Warnock Report would cause. There was opposition from religious figures, politicians and the general public to the very practice of this way of creating new life. It is a real tribute to the care with which the report was written that eventually legislation to regulate IVF went on to the statute book, and the regulatory body to oversee it - the HFEA - was set up. "Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Warnock committee is that it managed to get an ethical consensus that people understood as well as shared," observed a former HFEA chair. The results of Warnock's astuteness are to be seen in the formal structure of the HFEA as established in 1990. It must have expert medical and scientific representation, she advised, but it ought to be led by a lay chair - someone with strong ethical beliefs, but outside the IVF sector. Each of its decision-making committees should also have a lay majority. I have served as chair of the HFEA for the past six years. Next month will be my last authority meeting. So it seems an appropriate moment to reflect on my experience in that role. I have seen at first hand how the regulation of IVF uses the most elegant features of UK regulatory legislation to best advantage. Legislation is passed which lays down a broad-brush picture of a sensitive area's activities and how they need to be monitored. Then the specialist regulator monitors those activities on a day-to-day basis - in the case of IVF, recording the details of every one of the 60,000 cycles carried out in a calendar year, inspecting and licensing clinics in both the NHS and the private sector and approving research involving embryos. In a fast-changing field, decisions on difficult or anomalous cases are taken on an individual basis, with the best available expert advice, and policy is developed to cover new techniques and circumstances as they emerge. The most important consequence of the close scrutiny the HFEA gives is that public confidence is robustly maintained, even as the possibilities given to those unable to have children naturally, but desperate to do so, expand at a giddying speed. Baroness Warnock will have been barely aware in the 1980s of clinical possibilities which now enable parents who carry a rare genetic defect to have their embryos screened, and an undamaged one selected, so that the baby will not die in infancy. She could not have imagined the technique of mitochondrial replacement - removing the nucleus from an egg with mitochondrial abnormalities, and placing it in a donor egg. Over the past two years, the HFEA has carried out a consultation process with clinicians, scientists and the public in order to advise the present government on whether this technique - which has up to now only been allowed in the research laboratory - should be introduced into clinical practice. Perhaps surprisingly, the public supported the new technique, if it could prevent serious illness. They had little objection to its being approved for clinical use, as long as it was scrupulously overseen by an appropriate regulatory body. Like any outgoing chair, there are, of course things I regret not having achieved. My personal mission when I took up the post was, inevitably given my interests, public engagement - disseminating as widely as possible both the benefits and disadvantages of all aspects of assisted reproduction. This proved to be unexpectedly difficult to do. There is an extraordinarily high level of coverage of any story involving IVF in the media - celebrity births, tales of miracle babies after years of trying, and above all, breakthroughs in clinical practice which may bring hope to thousands wishing for their own child. This is a sector that trades in hope, and the papers and women's magazines are full of encouragement. Yet the success rates for IVF remain discouragingly low. The last figures we have show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients will emerge with a baby (the figures are somewhat higher for women under 35). That leaves two thirds of would-be mothers and fathers with the heartbreak of "failure". And the costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics, but the HFEA has no control over the prices charged. A couple - and nowadays that means same-sex couples as well as traditional partnerships - is likely to have spent something of the order of £15,000 for the three cycles it is likely to have taken should they be fortunate enough to become pregnant. I would have loved to have been able to have spoken more often and more publicly, with more words of caution for those proposing to undertake IVF, or postponing their family because IVF seems a reliable option should natural conception fail. Columnist Zoe Williams wrote a telling piece about the heartache of unsuccessful treatment last month, headlined Where's all the grief going? But newspapers today want banner headlines and excitement. Public information is nowhere on their agenda. Try as I might, I have not been able to talk at length to all those families out there who are about to enter the world of IVF, or who are undergoing treatment and being persuaded to try again and again when it fails, or who are entering their 40s and hoping IVF will allow them to start a late family. The world of IVF is a market, a market in hope. Those who enter it deserve to be fully informed of its potential to deliver grief and a sense of failure, as well as success.

      <body>Welcome to The Loop, the Magazine's letters column, including the best of your thoughts from Twitter and Facebook. Readers will, we hope, excuse confusion on our part this week when we saw this tweet from Noel Lynch. He wrote: "A lion tamer friend of mine once told me that lion urine works very well." But what was he referring to? Something to do with how to deter foxes from your garden, perhaps? The Magazine spoke to a fox expert who specialises in removing them in ways that will not harm the animal. They call it "humane deterrence" and don't like to be labelled as pest controllers. The trick is to disturb the wily creatures' normal behaviour. The piece singularly failed to discuss how one might humanely collect lion urine, however. So we thought perhaps the tip was something about how to deal with problematic housemates, as the Magazine had also noted that the high cost of rent in the UK forces many people into multiple-person houseshares. Avoiding picking a duff housemate can be tricky, but there could be a few signs to look out for. @Philly_Spurr: "If they come to view a flat with their annoying partner and casually enquire about a double bed, its a no go!" Housemates' partners can be trouble makers, as John Morris pointed out: "I shared a house with two girls in Shooters Hill in the 1970s. One day I came home and one of the girl's boyfriends had adorned the living room and hall with posters for the Socialist Workers' Party. I left." Amy Wilson for Leamington Spa is having a much more positive experience, though. "I currently live in a house share with 20 other people. Our little community comprises international students, young professionals and the odd nutter. The biggest thing I have learnt is compromise. The kitchens may not always be clean and food goes missing, but the experience of living with so many different people and cultures makes up for it tenfold. I have learnt so much from the people I live with I can forgive the odd mouldy cup!" After pondering Noel's tweet at length, we thought it might be referring to the story about exotic pastries - a new generation of French pastry chefs are reinventing their craft with audacious creations. Anyone for a caramel popcorn, pistachio orange or pecan eclair, or an olive-oil macaroon with mandarin orange and cucumber water? Perhaps these new flavours are crying out for a secret ingredient. Ingredients - particularly bitter ones - are popular with drinks such as the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". The taste of Negronis was the subject of a conversation by readers on Facebook. Could someone please help Sanjeev Prakash out? "Alright, I 'fess: I like Campari as an aperitif, but what the blazes is a Negroni..? Gin +______?" Jane Shepherd, perhaps, who loves Negronis. "When I was 23 I came back from an Italian break with a bottle of Campari, a drink I'd enjoyed in Rome and Sorrento. Instead of sipping it sedately and making it last, I made a big bucket of Negroni (not so easy on the gin) with my flatmates and felt no pain whatsoever." One thing we know a Negroni is not made from is lion urine. C'mon Noel Lynch, help us out here. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Garth Crooks has criticised Arsene Wenger and Jose Mourinho for their response to the Yaya Toure racism row. Arsenal manager Wenger wants to wait for "more proof" that Manchester City midfielder Toure was racially abused by CSKA Moscow fans on Wednesday. And Chelsea boss Mourinho has played down talk of black players boycotting the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Crooks, trustee of anti-racism campaign group Kick It Out, said he was "disappointed" by their comments. "How many more times are black players going to have to suffer this nonsense in order to play football," said BBC football expert Crooks, who played for Stoke and Tottenham. "For Wenger to ask for further evidence is extraordinary given the fact that Yaya heard the evidence reported and his club have backed their captain on the night. "I am equally disappointed with Jose Mourinho's comments, about how he feels that black players should go into a hostile racial environment in order to show them how good they are. "Now there is a man who has never had to suffer racial abuse. "I really expected modern managers such as Wenger and Mourinho to support Toure and other Premier League players." "If that is the best they can say on this issue, I suggest they stick to what they know." Toure claimed he was racially abused in Moscow and suggested African players might boycott the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Asked on Friday if a boycott was still a possibility, the Ivory Coast player told BBC Afrique: "We're not here yet." He added: "Let's leave Fifa and Uefa to do their work." Mourinho insists boycotting the 2018 World Cup is not the way to combat racism in football and urged players not to punish "billions" for the "disgraceful behaviour" of thousands. "The history of football was made equally by many races," he said. "And the black players have a fantastic contribution of what football is. "You go to the World Cup, the World Cup is the biggest expression of national team competitions - races, people from different parts of the globe, people from every continent. And the black players are very, very important for that. "Who is more important, the billions of people in love with the game around the world? Or a few thousand that go to football stadiums and have disgraceful behaviour in relation to black players. "If I was a black player I would say the other billions are much more important, so let's fight the thousands, but let's give to the billions what the billions want. And the billions want the best football and the best football without black players is not the best football, for sure." Wenger added that Uefa must complete its investigation before there is any more talk of a boycott. "I don't know what really happened there, but you cannot tolerate racism of any kind and you have to fight against it. How do you do that?" he said. "Honestly I believe Uefa is taking action in the right way and to go as extreme as a boycott, it's a bit early to do that because it's not proven what happened. I believe that Russia itself has to fight against that and of course you want everybody to be active on that." Toure spoke to referee Ovidiu Hategan during the 2-1 win over CSKA to complain about the behaviour of the home fans, although the Russian club have denied any racist abuse took place. The Romanian official chose to do nothing at the time, but Uefa, which governs European football, has since opened disciplinary proceedings against CSKA Moscow for the "racist behaviour of their fans". </body>

But South Africa vice-captain AB de Villiers said: "We are not a team that scratches the ball." The decision meant the umpires had decided the ball's condition had been changed contrary to the game's rules. It is expected the umpires will lay a charge against Du Plessis to match referee David Boon after the day's play, with an immediate hearing to follow. "We don't cheat, it is as simple as that," De Villiers continued. "I know Faf du Plessis very well, he's the last player on the field who will try something like that. "It is part of his responsibility to shine the ball and get it to swing. It's not an easy job and I thought he did it very well." Gould and fellow umpire Rod Tucker, who also ordered the ball to be changed, took the unusual action at the start of the evening session in Dubai, where South Africa are on the verge of completing a comfortable victory. After bowling Pakistan out for 99 in their first innings, Smith hit 234 and AB de Villiers 164 as South Africa made 517 in reply. Pakistan were 132-4 at the close on day three, needing a further 286 to avoid an innings defeat. "As per 42.1 of the ICC playing conditions, the umpires replaced the ball and fined the South Africa team five penalty runs for ball tampering," an ICC spokesperson confirmed. The last time a five-run penalty was issued for ball tampering was during the 2006 Oval Test between England and Pakistan, when the tourists were adjudged the guilty party. Pakistan captain Inzamam-ul-Haq reacted angrily and decided not to continue the Test in protest. Australian umpire Darrell Hair duly awarded the game to England - the only forfeited match in Test history. This month, the ICC amended its laws regarding the condition of balls, saying "if a player responsible can be identified" the ball will be changed, a five-run penalty will be awarded and the player responsible will be reported. Altering the condition of the ball is a level two offence under the ICC's code of conduct, which carries a penalty of 50-100% of their match fee and/or suspension from one Test or two one-day internationals for a first offence. </body>

      <title>Vettel not afraid of a top team-mate</title>

      <body>Sebastian Vettel would not be "afraid" of taking on one of Formula 1's other leading names as his team-mate but insists he has nothing to prove. The German can clinch a fourth world title in India on Sunday but has to face claims his remarkable success is largely down to having the best car. Red Bull resisted opportunities in the last 18 months to sign Lewis Hamilton, Kimi Raikkonen and Fernando Alonso. "One day maybe I will race alongside Kimi or Fernando," Vettel said. "It depends how long we stick around. But I am not afraid of that because you want to beat the guys on the track and you want to find out who is the best." Vettel, who has won the last five races in a row, needs only a fifth place in the Indian Grand Prix to be absolutely sure of the title. Only Ferrari's Fernando Alonso is mathematically able to beat him, but is 90 points behind with only 100 still available. The Spaniard needs to out-score Vettel by 16 points on Sunday to prolong the championship to the next race in Abu Dhabi next weekend. Vettel, who was talking in a BBC Sport interview to be broadcast ahead of the race on Sunday, rejected a suggestion that he needs to take on Alonso, Hamilton or Raikkonen in another car to prove his greatness to any doubters. "You can think about this a lot," he said. "I think we don't have to prove anything. I think we have proven enough. "We have had three fantastic years. This year has been fantastic. I believe things happen for a reason. "For sure you need the right package. We had a very strong package the last couple of years. I believe we had a very strong package in 2009, when we finished second in the championship. "With the experience I have today maybe 2009 would have been different. At the time I did the best I could. I did mistakes, I still do now, but the most important thing is I learn from them. "You can find lots of difficulties I had to face. [Last year] we got sent to the back of the grid in Abu Dhabi and had to come back, we had a nightmare race in Brazil. "We managed to come back [and seal the championship]. It was a bit tight in some places, a bit lucky. We worked very hard for what we have achieved basically, as a team. "For sure some people will think you have to do this and that. The most important is to prove something to yourself." Asked how he felt he compared as a driver to Hamilton and Alonso, Vettel said: "It's difficult because I don't know what they do. I can see what they do on the track. I don't know how much time they spend setting up the car, how much they care. "I'm sure we all care because no-one wants to drive a car that is set up badly, but for sure some people invest more time and some less. I don't think there is a right and wrong, it is what you feel happy with."

      <body>England coach Steve McNamara cut short his news conference ahead of their World Cup opener against Australia. McNamara walked out after six minutes as he was questioned on his selection decisions. Second row forward Gareth Hock was removed from the squad after a breach of discipline following England's 15-14 defeat by Italy in a warm-up game. Prop James Graham has not been selected for Saturday's opener with the Kangaroos at the Millennium Stadium. Hock told the BBC that he does not think his breach of discipline was serious enough for him to be removed from England's World Cup squad. The forward, 30, said he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy. McNamara refused to discuss the disciplinary issues during the media conference and no players were made available to speak. The England coach was questioned about absence of Graham from his 19-man squad, amid speculation that the former St Helens forward had been involved in the post-Italy game incident. "There are seven very good players not playing this week," McNamara said. "I'm certainly not going to talk about any individuals among those seven. "They are all great players, great people and I'm sure they'll get a part to play during the rest of the tournament." McNamara denied it had been a tough week for him ahead of the opener with Australia and has faith in his squad despite disciplinary issues. "It's been a week as a coach, simple as that, preparing a team getting ready to face Australia and a team that under-performed last week against Italy," he said. "That's been the nuts and the bolts of the job this week. "I think the world of that squad, every single one of them and they will all play a part during this World Cup." McNamara became frustrated as he was questioned on disciplinary issues and said: "I'm not going to answer any more questions on it. If you want to continue asking the questions, then we'll wrap up now." McNamara briefly went on to talk about the match against Australia but ended the session abruptly when asked about Hock. Australia coach Tim Sheens denied he was pleased to see England's troubled build-up to Saturday's game in Cardiff. "I made the comment earlier in the week that an embarrassed side is a dangerous side," he said. "Anyone involved in sport understands that when things go wrong, it can have the exact reverse effect." </body>

      <body>George Ford kicked all Bath's points as they went second in the Premiership by beating local rivals Gloucester. All of the points in a tight first half came from penalties, with Ford kicking three for Bath and Freddie Burns replying once for the visitors. Bath stretched their 9-3 half-time lead with another Ford penalty, but Burns added a try, conversion and penalty to keep Gloucester in touch. Ford took his tally to 15 points as Bath recorded a dramatic win. There was a cautious opening from both sides in the pouring rain and Ford put the hosts ahead with a second-minute penalty. The rain relented but it was an error-strewn half, with neither side able to stamp their authority on the game. A strong period of Bath pressure resulted in Ford adding his second and third penalties of the night. Gloucester's Burns successfully landed his first attempt at goal soon after, while Ford missed for the first time as he twice put 30-metre kicks across the face of goal. Bath, unbeaten at home this season, increased their six-point half-time lead with Ford's fourth successful penalty. But he missed a simple attempt to stretch the home side's lead further as his kicking continued to be erratic, while Burns hit the upright at the other end. Rupert Harden was sin-binned but, rather than hamper Gloucester, it spurred the visitors on to the game's first try, as Burns raced over after a Bath error and he also added the extras. Ford made it five penalties from eight to increase Bath's lead again, but Burns hit back immediately against his former club to take his haul to 13 points. With the clock ticking down, Ford missed an attempt to open up a five-point lead with another unsuccessful kick, but it proved irrelevant in the end as Bath hung on for their fourth victory of the season. Bath head coach Mike Ford: "I thought we dominated the game. We put ourselves under pressure though, missed a few goal kicks, conceded a charge-down try. But apart from that, I thought we were dominant in most facets. "We are second now and we're pleased where we are. Conditions didn't help but we believe we've only scratched the surface with this team. "There were some pleasing things. I'm not disappointed about winning derby games." Gloucester director of rugby Nigel Davies: "Overall, it was a poor game of rugby. I was disappointed with elements of our performance but the biggest disappointment for me was our discipline. "If we had remained disciplined we could have sneaked something out of that game. "There were periods of the second half where the momentum had changed, we had good field position, we could have have put pressure on Bath, but because we were undisciplined we didn't."

      <body>A man has been found guilty of murdering his business partner and throwing her down a well shaft in an attempt to gain a £1m inheritance. A jury at Reading Crown Court found Christopher Symons, 63, of Cambridge Street, Aylesbury, had killed Patricia Goodband, 76, in December. Her body was found concealed in the well in the grounds of her home near Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in January. Symons, who had denied murder, will be sentenced on Monday. The court earlier heard allegations that Symons "used" his sister Kathleen Adams and his lover Jennifer Creasey to hide his crime. Ms Adams, 74, of Aylesbury Road, Princes Risborough, was found not guilty of one count of perverting the course of justice. Creasey, 73, of Hale Road, Benson, Oxfordshire, was found guilty of one of two counts of the same charge. Symons' friend Robert Taft, 59, of Kings Close, Westcott, Aylesbury, had previously admitted perverting the course of justice and possession of ammunition without a certificate. Taft and Creasey will also be sentenced on Monday. Ms Goodband, who was last seen on 17 December, was reported missing by her daughter on 9 January. Her body was found on 21 January. During Symons' trial, the court heard Ms Goodband had been friends with him for more than 30 years and had run a road haulage and agricultural business with him from her home in Woodham. The prosecution said he killed her on 22 December in a "cold blooded, planned murder for financial gain", and his "motive was clear". A post-mortem examination found she died from head injuries. The defence had said much of the evidence against Mr Symons was "circumstantial and incomplete". Symons told police he dropped Mrs Goodband off at Milton Keynes station so she could go away over Christmas. His defence admitted this was untrue, but said Mr Symons was a man who lived a life of pretence and the fact he had lied did not mean he was guilty of murder. Det Supt Chris Ward from Thames Valley Police said Symons' actions were "pre-meditated and motivated purely by greed". "In order to inherit her property and share of their business, [he] devised a cruel and calculated plan to murder Patricia and make it appear as if she vanished without a trace," he said. "This has been a complex inquiry in which we have had to unpick all of Symons' lies in order to uncover the truth." </body>

      <title>Teenager sentenced for acid attack</title>
      <description>A 16-year-old boy is sentenced to eight years for an acid attack on a woman in Romford, east London.</description>

      <body>A 16-year-old boy has been sentenced to eight years and three months for an acid attack on a woman in east London. Tara Quigley, 28, suffered injuries to her face and upper body when acid was thrown at her as she answered the door at her home in Romford on 30 April. Liam Robert Sibbons pleaded guilty to a charge of throwing corrosive fluid on a person with intent to do grievous bodily harm (GBH). Sibbons will serve six years and three months in custody. He will be released on licence for the remainder of his sentence. The teenager can now be named after Judge David Radford lifted a reporting restriction. Prosecutor Martin Whitehouse told Snaresbrook Crown Court: "This was a horrific attack, involving a degree of brutality and callousness rarely encountered. "Almost, one might say, beyond comprehension." Miss Quigley, who did not know the teenager, has been left permanently scarred and will need regular treatment over the next four years. She suffered burns to 7% of her body, including her right arm, forearm, shoulder, chest, neck and face. The court heard that most of the burns went almost all the way through her skin and Miss Quigley has had two skin grafts which have only been 85% successful. In a victim impact statement, Miss Quigley, who was in court, said: "The attack has left me feeling as though my life has been blown apart." She added she was in constant pain and did not feel safe returning to her home. "I will have to live with this attack and the scars it has left me with for the rest of my life and nothing I can say or do will change that," she said. "I truly hope that the man responsible knows just what he has done and the grief and anguish he has caused to me and my entire family." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley had been at home when she saw someone approaching the house. When she opened the door she was asked by the person if she was called Michelle. She replied no and the person walked off, however 10 minutes later there was a loud knock on the door. The prosecutor said: "Miss Quigley opened the front door and saw the same man. He was holding onto a white bottle with both hands. "He then pointed the bottle at Miss Quigley and squeezed." Mr Whitehouse said Miss Quigley felt an almost immediate burning sensation when the liquid came into contact with her skin. The court heard she shut the door and began to scream, and then ran into the kitchen and started splashing water on her face. An ambulance was called and Miss Quigley was taken to hospital for treatment. Sibbons received an acid burn to the left side of his chest during the attack. He had four previous convictions and was on bail at the time of the incident. Judge Radford said Sibbons had refused to explain why he carried out the attack. The judge said: "It was, in my judgment, a truly wicked offence, which clearly was premeditated." He added that the attack could have been a case of mistaken identity and a large amount of money had been found after the teenager was arrested. "Whether this was because you were being paid to commit this offence and there was some kind of mistake about the identity of the victim is a matter for speculation in the absence of candour and honesty on your part," the judge said. </body>

      <body>Scottish councils have imposed a pay deal on their staff after almost a year of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. Council staff other than teachers will get a 1% rise backdated to April of this year - and a further 1% rise next April. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla. Cosla said it could not allow the "dragging of feet" by the Unison union to continue. "This cannot continue any longer - our employees deserve their pay rise now," said Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry. "We have been in negotiations with the Scottish Joint Council trade unions for almost a full year after making an initial offer in November 2012. "The unions remain divided and the time has come to apply the deal." Mr Hendry added: "I am particularly pleased with the ground-breaking award of a living wage of £7.50 per hour in 2013/14, which will deliver real benefits for employees at the lower end of the pay scale, and an agreement to match the recommended figure due next month from the Living Wage Foundation for 2014/15, which will see a further living wage increase for the lowest paid." The pay deal does not apply to teachers. Earlier this week the largest teachers' union, the EIS, rejected changes to their terms and conditions of employment. The pay deal was conditional on accepting these changes. Mr Hendry continued: "It is deeply frustrating for me that I am not in a position to announce a pay increase at this time for our teaching workforce. "The decision by the EIS not to agree a deal has resulted in what we believe is an unnecessary delay. "Talks will continue in November which we hope will also bring this matter to a conclusion." </body>

      <body>Floodlight failure at half-time meant the first Highland derby of the season had to be abandoned. With the match poised at 0-0 after a lacklustre opening 45 minutes, Ross County's Global Energy Stadium was plunged into darkness. Inverness had the better of the first-half but referee John Beaton was busiest, issuing five yellow cards. Half-time was extended and although the floodlights briefly came on again, they failed a second time. Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor told BBC Radio Scotland: "We're really disappointed for all the fans, the officials and the players. "And also for you guys, the BBC who've come up to the Highlands for the game. "With the rain today, with all the water, I'm afraid we're not in control of that at all." Referee Beaton told BBC Radio Scotland: "We gave it as long as we could but the third chance was the last chance and when the lights failed we couldn't wait any longer. "It was caused by an overload; the players enjoyed the first half, as did the match officials. We're all disappointed. It gets to the point: how long can we leave them sitting in the dark? "We'd have loved to have finished the game but we'll need to come back again." Inverness manager Terry Butcher told BBC Radio Scotland: "It's just one of those things. "I'm not sure what the reason was but we live to fight another day and we'll come back and do it all again. It's disappointing of course." </body>

      <body>A second letter bomb addressed to a serving senior police officer has been discovered at a mail sorting office in Northern Ireland. The package was found at a Royal Mail depot in Lisburn, County Antrim. It comes hours after a device in a package addressed to the PSNI chief constable was intercepted at a sorting office in north Belfast. Assistant Chief Constable Will Kerr said it was thought that dissident republicans were behind both incidents. He also blamed dissidents for pipe bomb attacks on police vehicles in Londonderry and the outskirts of Belfast over the last three days. "All four, along with other attacks this months, have been designed to kill police officers," he told a press conference on Friday. "We are very lucky we are not dealing with a fatality this morning." An Army bomb team dealt with the device at Mallusk, north Belfast, early on Friday. It had been addressed to Matt Baggott at police headquarters in Knock, east Belfast. Later, a delivery office at Linenhall Street, Lisburn, was evacuated following the discovery of a suspicious object. The police said that both packages contained a viable device. Justice Minister David Ford said of the first device: "Those who sent this device have no concern whatsoever for the staff at the Mallusk sorting office, whose vigilance is to be commended." Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the Mallusk attack was "callous and reckless". "Those responsible for this device have almost no support and have demonstrated a blatant disregard for the safety of those who could have been injured," she said. "The chief constable undertakes a challenging role in delivering community policing in a difficult environment." A spokeswoman for Royal Mail said: "The Northern Ireland mail centre at Mallusk was evacuated overnight due to a suspect package. "Unfortunately there will be an effect on deliveries today and we apologise for any inconvenience this may cause." Police have appealed for the public to be vigilant and report anything that looks suspicious. </body>

      <body>A man has been found guilty of the attempted murder of County Armagh woman Natasha McShane and her friend Stacy Jurich in Chicago three years ago. Heriberto Viramontes, 34, was convicted at Cook County Criminal Court in the US city on Thursday. The pair were attacked and robbed in the early hours of 23 April, 2010. Ms McShane, who had been attending the University of Illinois at the time of the assault, has been left with severe brain damage. Just before 18:00 local time - midnight UK time - on Thursday, her family, along with Stacy Jurich and her family, were called for the verdict. The trial lasted five days, it took three and a half hours to find Viramontes guilty on all charges. There were emotional scenes as the verdicts were delivered. Shortly afterwards, a statement written by Natasha's brother, Conor, was read out to the press by the state's attorney. "This crime against my sister has changed my life forever. It has had a devastating impact on our entire family," the statement said. Conor McShane said the family was pleased and relieved at the verdicts. But he also said that Natasha's life had been ruined by the attack. She has been left unable to talk or walk unaided. Stacy Jurich said that the time since the attack had been the most difficult in her life. "We have had a lot of support from our families, friends and complete strangers," she said. "But the last three and a half years have been the hardest time in my entire life. Not only was it a struggle for me, but it has been a struggle to face what happened to my best friend, Natasha - something I will never forget." Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez said: "Chicago is a beautiful city, it is a shame that someone like Natasha McShane, who was here to continue her schooling, someone who was visiting from Ireland, that she was not able to enjoy all the beauty that Chicago has to offer. "Instead of welcoming our visitors with an open heart, she was confronted with a baseball bat. I am very pleased that this man has been held responsible for the brutal and senseless beating of both Stacy Jurich and Natasha McShane." Viramontes faces between six and 120 years in prison. In July, his accomplice Marcy Cruz was jailed for 22 years after pleading guilty to two counts of attempted murder over the attack. </body>

      <description>A recycling firm is fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen".</description>

      <body>A recycling firm has been fined £90,000 after an employee lost an arm in an accident which was "waiting to happen". Neath Port Talbot Recycling Ltd was also ordered to pay £50,000 costs following the incident in 2011. Swansea Crown court heard a similar incident happened in 2007 and over the following years the firm had been warned about its health and safety measures. The company said it deeply regretted what happened to employee Stephen John. The court was told how the 57-year-old was asked to clean a conveyor belt which had become blocked with a sticky black substance known as flack. The company did not have any risk assessment or safe system of work for completing this task, and experienced employees like Mr John had developed their own way of cleaning the conveyor belt roller. This system of work was devised partly because the control switch was located some distance away from the actual conveyor. To clean the rollers, one employee stood by the control switch, which is out of sight from the conveyor, and a second person inserted a bar and scraped the flack from the roller. He then inserted his arm to wipe away the flack. A command was given to the switch controller and the conveyor was started and stopped quickly. The process was repeated until the roller was clean. The court heard on the day of the incident, Mr John inserted his arm and was wiping the flack away. He then passed the bar to a work colleague. The switch controller misinterpreted this as a signal and started the conveyor. Mr John's right forearm was trapped and amputated by the conveyor belt. Speaking after the hearing, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector Sarah Baldwin-Jones said the potential for greater harm or a fatal accident was also a realistic possibility. "The company failed to fully guard the conveyor around the tail end roller and this failure resulted in employees having access to dangerous parts of the machine," she said. "The risk of entrapment is well known in the industry, and this company could have taken simple steps to fit guarding. "There was also no line of sight between Mr John and the employee operating the machinery and the company failed to carry out a risk assessment when the conveyor was installed. "They also failed to devise a safe way of cleaning the rollers and to instruct employees on how to clean them safely." Neath Port Talbot Recycling of Crymlyn Burrows, Swansea, pleaded guilty to two safety breaches. Managing director Will Watson told BBC Wales the company deeply regretted what had happened and that issues at the plant had now been addressed. </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <title>Militants raid north Nigerian city</title>
      <description>Militants engage security forces in a long gun battle in a key city in northern Nigeria, while the army says it has killed 74 militants elsewhere.</description>

      <body>Suspected Boko Haram militants have engaged security forces in a lengthy gun battle and raided a hospital in the northern Nigerian city of Damaturu. Residents told the BBC that it was a "big, audacious attack" and that assailants stole drugs from the hospital and drove off in ambulances. Meanwhile, the military said it had killed 74 suspected Boko Haram militants in a raid in Borno state. Authorities have recently stepped up their campaign against the militants. North-eastern Nigeria is the focus of an insurgency by the group that began in 2009 and aims to create an Islamic state. President Goodluck Jonathan urged the military to up its campaign against Boko Haram five months ago. Damaturu is the main city in Yobe state, which lies to the west of Borno. It has been calm for more than a year, and there is a large military presence in there. Nonetheless, gunfire rocked the city for some seven hours after a group of about 20 gunmen - some in military uniform - targeted the hospital late on Thursday. Clashes between militants and the security forces spread to other parts of the city. A health worker described seeing a police vehicle ferrying corpses to the mortuary. The resident who described the attack as "audacious" said the gunfire was heavy, continuous, and loud. He also said that people in Damaturu were surprised that it had taken the military at least an hour to respond. Authorities later imposed a 24-hour curfew, and streets were deserted on Friday. The military raid in Borno state involved "ground and aerial assault" and "led to the destruction of the identified terrorist camps," said army spokesman Lt Mohammed Dole. Lt Dole said the latest raid had been carried out on Thursday and that two soldiers had been wounded. The BBC's Will Ross reports from Nigeria that it seems surprising that Boko Haram camps are still being found, given all the resources available to the army. The army's claims about military operations against the group are hard to verify - there has been no mobile phone network in Borno state since the latest offensive was launched. Nigeria's campaign has been criticised by human rights groups. Amnesty International said earlier this month that hundreds had died in detention in north-eastern Nigeria, some from starvation or extra-judicial killings. Nigeria's interior said the report was "not true". </body>

      <description>Kenya's interior minister fires 15 immigration officers over security lapses as investigations into the Westgate shopping centre siege continue.</description>

      <body>Kenya's interior minister has sacked 15 immigration officers as investigations into the Westgate mall siege continue. Joseph Ole Lenku said the officials had endangered national security by issuing ID documents to illegal immigrants. He also said the government would start repatriating Somali refugees to prevent further attacks. At least 67 people died when militants from the Somali Islamist al-Shabab group attacked the Nairobi shopping centre last month. Kenya is host to the largest refugee camp in the world, Dadaab - home to about half a million people - near the Somali border, while it is believed that more than 30,000 Somali refugees live in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, alone. Mr Lenku said the sacked immigration officers would appear in court to face the law. The government would also be carrying out a thorough audit of identity cards and passports issued in the country in the last two years, he said. "This exercise will enable us flush out all those who have been issued with illegal passports and other identification documents," Kenya's Star newspaper quoted him as saying. "We have welcomed with open arms, refugees fleeing from insecurity in neighbouring countries but we won't allow them to harm us," he added in his address to journalists in Nairobi. "Because of the returning calm in some parts of the Federal Republic of Somali, the process of repatriating Somali refugees has started," he said. Kenya has about 4,000 troops in the south of Somalia as part of the UN-backed African Union force which has made significant advances against al-Shabab in the last two years, recapturing the area's main cities. But the militants still control many smaller towns and large rural areas of southern Somalia. The BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Nairobi says this is not the first time those fleeing the violence in neighbouring Somalia have been thrust uncomfortably into the spotlight. Even before Westgate, some politicians had blamed elements in the country's Dadaab refugee camp for attacks inside Kenya, he says. Previous attempts to repatriate Somali refugees have met with strong resistance, both from the UN and Kenya's own courts, our reporter adds. But more than a month after the attack on the shopping mall, the Kenyan government is under pressure - both its handling of intelligence and its response to the attack itself have been called into question, he says. Somalia's envoy to Kenya, Mohamed Ali Nur, has warned against blaming the refugees. "These refugees who are in the camps are innocent people. I want to say that the refugees themselves have been victims. Some of them were killed, some women were raped, and kids were killed," Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper quoted him as saying on Tuesday. Al-Shabab, which is part of the al-Qaeda network, is banned as a terrorist group by both the US and the UK and is believed to have between 7,000 and 9,000 fighters. Its members are fighting to create an Islamic state in Somalia and the group said it had staged the Westgate attack in response to Kenya's presence on Somali territory. Officials initially said 10 to 15 gunmen were involved, but CCTV footage appears to show only four militants, who the Kenyan military say all died by the end of the siege. The BBC's Newsnight programme has revealed that one of the four attackers is suspected of being a 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. </body>

      <title>China court rejects Bo Xilai appeal</title>
      <description>A high court in China has rejected the appeal of top politician Bo Xilai, jailed for life for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power.</description>

      <body>A Chinese court has rejected the appeal of former politician Bo Xilai and upheld his life sentence for bribery, embezzlement and abuse of power. The former Chongqing Communist Party leader was convicted of the charges in September. He was removed from office in 2012 amid a scandal which saw his wife convicted of a British businessman's murder. The high court in Shandong, the province where Bo's trial was held, accepted his appeal earlier this month. "The facts of the first instance verdict are clear, the evidence is reliable, sufficient and the sentence is appropriate," the high court said in its ruling, which was posted on its website. "The court rules as follows: reject the appeal, uphold the original verdict. This verdict is the final ruling." The hearing appeared to have been brief, with the verdict coming about an hour after a convoy believed to be carrying Bo was seen arriving at the court. Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed Bo's elder son, Li Wangzhi, in court with other relatives. Bo only receives one chance to appeal and his sentence is now final. He could submit a complaint to the Supreme People's Court in Beijing, but the vast majority of such complaints are rejected and do not result in another trial, reports the BBC's Celia Hatton in Beijing. Correspondents said few expected Bo's conviction to be overturned. The courts are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, from which Bo was expelled from last year. Bo Xilai, the charismatic former party chief in the city of Chongqing in south-western China, was a member of the powerful politburo - one of the 25 most senior party officials in the country. But he was removed from office last year amid a scandal which began when his deputy, Wang Lijun, sought refuge in the US consulate in Chengdu. The incident prompted an investigation into the death of British businessman Neil Heywood. Bo Xilai's wife, Gu Kailai, was eventually convicted of Mr Heywood's murder - a crime caused, the court said, by a financial dispute. Wang was also jailed for 15 years for helping Gu cover up the murder. Bo himself was found guilty of taking bribes amounting to 20m yuan ($3.3m, £2m) either personally or through his family. He was also accused of abusing his office by using his position to cover up for his wife's crime. Bo's supporters, however, believe he is the victim of a political purge. His downfall came as China prepared for its once-in-a-decade leadership transfer, as one generation of leaders made way for the next. Bo had been seen as a candidate for the very top, until his fall from grace. It was the biggest political shake-up to hit China's ruling elite in decades. The final verdict in the Bo case comes weeks before the Communist Party holds a major meeting in November to set economic policy. </body>

      <title>North Korea returns six S Koreans</title>
      <description>North Korea returns six South Korean men, aged between 27 and 67, to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare handover.</description>

      <body>North Korea has returned six South Korean men to their homeland, South Korean officials say, in a rare move. The men, between the ages of 27 and 67, were handed over on Friday at the truce village of Panmunjom, on the border between the two countries. Their names were not released and details surrounding their detention in the North remain unclear. The two Koreas remain technically at war, as the 1950-53 conflict ended in an armistice and not a peace treaty. Pyongyang's Red Cross informed Seoul that the men would be handed back via Panmunjom on Thursday, a statement from South Korea's Unification Ministry said. Officials said the group would be taken to South Korea's spy agency to face questions over their presence in North Korea. The South Korean government said that at first glance, the men were not on the list of those abducted by the North. One possibility is that they may have crossed into North Korea illegally from China, the BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says. Unofficial travel to North Korea by private citizens from South Korea is illegal, Pyongyang's state news agency announced the detention of several unnamed South Korean nationals in 2010 and there is speculation that they may be among those returned, our correspondent adds. The move by North Korea is seen as a gesture of reconciliation following the cancellation of reunions for families split by the division of the Korean peninsula at the end of the Korean War which were planned for last month. Tensions between the two Koreas rose earlier this year, after North Korea's third nuclear test in February. </body>

      <title>DNA test proves mystery girl parents</title>
      <description>DNA tests confirm a Bulgarian Roma couple as the parents of mystery child Maria, whose discovery in Greece last week made global news headlines.</description>

      <body>DNA tests have confirmed a Bulgarian Roma couple as the biological parents of mystery child Maria, found in Greece last week, Bulgarian officials say. They identified the couple as Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev. The officials are investigating whether the mother had sold the child - a claim she has denied. Maria was found at a Roma camp in central Greece. Police noticed the lack of resemblance between the blonde girl and the adults she was staying with. The couple, Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou, have since been charged with child abduction. They have insisted the girl was given to them legitimately. Maria - who was found near Farsala, central Greece - is currently being cared for by the Athens-based charity The Smile of the Child. There have been thousands of inquiries following an appeal to identify her. The case has also sparked concern over prejudice and racism towards Roma people. The child's parents - Sasha Ruseva and Atanas Rusev - and their eight children, had been filmed earlier by Bulgarian television at their home in the Roma district of the central town of Nikolaevo. Ms Ruseva, holding a child with red hair, told reporters that she and her husband had been working in the Greek city of Larisa four years ago when she gave birth to a girl. The girl was seven months old when they had to return to Bulgaria, and she said she could not afford to take the child with her. She said she was talking to a woman she worked with who told her: "Give me this child, I will take care of it. You can come and take it back any time you want. "But I had other children to take care of and I couldn't go... I have never got any money for it." Bulgarian officials said that during questioning, Ms Ruseva said she had recognised Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou as the people she had left her child with. Prosecutors have pressed preliminary charges against Ms Ruseva for "deliberately selling a child while residing out of the country". In Greece, a lawyer representing the couple in the Roma camp near Farsala said on Friday they planned to seek legal custody of Maria. "Provided what we said is borne out, that it was not an abduction, then logically they will be released from prison and they will be able to enter a proper [adoption] process," Costas Katsavos was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency. "They truly and ardently want her back," he added. Maria's biological parents in Bulgaria also say they want to be re-united with her. However, the head of Bulgaria's social services department, Lidia Hristova, told Reuters: "After an investigation, we will decide what would be best for the child, whether to take her from the family, to offer social service, or so on." There will now be difficult questions for police both in Greece and Bulgaria, the BBC's Mark Lowen in Athens reports. He adds that clearly there will still be a legal case against the Greek couple, and possibly against Maria's parents as well. But Greek police could be left red-faced for making the initial allegations of abduction, our correspondent adds. Greek news site zougla.gr has published what it says is Ms Ruseva's identity card and a birth certificate for Maria from a hospital in Lamia, not far from Farsala and Larisa. The birth certificate says the girl was born in January 2009. Christos Salis and Eleftheria Dimopoulou have told police Maria was four years old, but the Smile of the Child charity say medical examinations suggest she is more like five or six. </body>

      <title>Women gain as gender gap 'narrows'</title>
      <description>The gender gap is narrowing across the world, a World Economic Forum report suggests, with Nordic countries leading the way but Arab nations lagging behind.</description>

      <body>The gap between men and women has narrowed slightly in the past year in most countries, according to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report. Iceland, Finland and Norway top the list of 136 nations, based on political participation, economic equality and rights like education and health. The Middle East and North Africa were the only regions not to improve in the past year, with Yemen at the bottom. The Philippines and Nicaragua both feature in the top 10. The WEF has produced the report annually for the past eight years. The release of this year's edition comes as the BBC rounds off a month-long focus on women and gender around the world with a major event at Broadcasting House in London. One hundred women from all around the world are gathering for a day of debate and discussion as the 100 Women season comes to an end. Iceland's position at the top of the WEF rankings was the fifth year in a row the country has been named the world's most equal. Report founder and co-author Saadia Zahidi told the BBC that since the WEF began compiling the index in 2006, 80% of countries had made progress. "What's worrying though is that 20% of countries have made no progress or are falling behind," she said. She singled out the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia as countries that had invested in education and health, but had not integrated women into the economy. Nadia al-Sakkaf, editor of the English-language Yemen Times, in London for the 100 Women conference, told the BBC that she had stopped counting the years her country had languished at the bottom of the equality list. "It comes down to everyday life. We had three women running for president in 2006. We have lots of women in senior positions," she said. "But our levels of maternal mortality are very high, and 35% of girls aged 6-14 years old are not in school." Human capital Saadia Zahidi of the WEF said that by contrast many sub-Saharan countries had not invested in women, but through necessity they played a major role in the economy. Nordic countries continued to lead the way because they had a long history of investing in people, she said. "They are small economies with small populations; they recognise that talent matters, and that talent has to be men and women. Overall, the report, entitled Global Gender Gap Report 2013, found Iceland to be the most advanced country in the world in terms of gender equality for the fifth year running. Iceland, Finland (second), Norway (third) and Sweden (fourth) had all closed over 80% of the gender gap, where 100% would represent full equality. The highest-ranked Asian nation was the Philippines (fifth), praised for its success in health, education and economic participation. Asia's major economies performed poorly, with China in 69th place and Japan 105th. Nicaragua in 10th place was the highest positioned country in North and South America, and was praised for a "strong performance" in terms of political empowerment. Among major world economies Germany ranked 14th (down one), the UK held its position at 18, with Canada at 20 and the United States 23rd. On matters of health and survival, the report finds that 96% of the gap has now closed. In terms of education, the global gender gap is 93% closed, with 25 countries now judged to deliver equal treatment to boys and girls at school. It is a different picture on the core issue of economic equality, where the gender gap has closed by 60%. In developing and developed countries alike, women's presence in economic leadership positions is limited. And while women have made small gains in political representation - 2% this year - only 21% of that global gender gap has closed Ms Zahidi said the idea of the report was not to remind poor countries that they had fewer opportunities than rich countries, but to give them a tool to improve the situation. "Women make up one half of the human capital available to any economy and any company; if that talent isn't integrated, that is going to be a loss for both women and men," she said. </body>

      <body>At least one person has died and dozens more are injured in an explosion and fire that tore through a sweet factory in northern Mexico. A boiler is believed to have exploded in the Dulces Blueberry factory at an industrial park in Ciudad Juarez, causing the ceiling to collapse. About 300 people were said to be in the factory at the time and several are still unaccounted for. Fire crews and about 30 ambulances were at the scene. Ciudad Juarez Civil Protection Director Fernando Mota said firefighters found a body inside the factory and that six of the injured were in a serious condition. He said several workers were missing and could be trapped inside the building. "We're still searching the area to see if there are more dead," he added. Footage from the scene showed local people gathering outside, many of them in tears as they awaited news of friends or relatives. Paramedics were treating the injured, some of whom were badly burned. Ciudad Juarez is in the state of Chihuahua on the border with the US state of Texas. Factories such as the one affected, known as maquiladoras, are located in a free trade zone between the United States and Mexico. They are estimated to employ more than one million Mexicans. The BBC's Will Grant in Mexico City says maquiladoras are often criticised by labour rights groups for their low wages and poor working conditions, as they try to compete with China to manufacture cheap goods for the US market. </body>

      <title>Cuba to scrap two-currency system</title>

      <body>Cuba is to scrap its two-currency system in the latest financial reform rolled out by President Raul Castro, official media report. Since 1994 Cuba has had two currencies, one pegged to the US dollar and the other worth only a fraction of that. The more valuable convertible peso (CUC) was reserved for use in the tourism sector and foreign trade. Now its value will be gradually unified with the lower-value CUP, ending a system resented by ordinary Cubans. The Cuban economy is almost entirely state-run and the tourism sector has boomed since the collapse of the Soviet Union plunged Cuba into economic isolation and hardship. The two-currency system was supposed to protect Cuba's fragile economy but angered locals paid in the much lower-value CUP and denied access to goods only available for those with convertible pesos. The policy exacerbated the creation of a two-tier class system in Cuba which divided privileged Cubans with access to the lucrative tourist and foreign-trade sectors from those working in the local economy - all-too-visibly contradicting Cuba's supposedly egalitarian society. The council of ministers has approved a timetable for implementing "measures that will lead to monetary and exchange unification", the official Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Unification is "imperative to guarantee the re-establishment of the Cuban peso's value and its role as money, that is as a unit of accounting, means of payment and savings", it said. It gave no details of how quickly the change would be implemented, though Reuters news agency quoted Cuban economists as saying it would take about 18 months. </body>

      <description>At least 20 people have been killed and many others injured in a car bomb blast outside a mosque in Syria's Damascus province, activists say.</description>

      <body>At least 20 people including children have been reported killed in a car bomb blast in Syria, outside a mosque in a town in Damascus province. The blast, in the town of Suq Wadi Barada, came just before the end of Friday prayers and brought down the mosque's entrances. It was not clear who had carried out the attack. Meanwhile, Norway has turned down a request to help the UN dismantle Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. The UN has set a deadline of mid-2014 for the weapons to be destroyed. Sweden has offered to provide an air force unit to transport the weapons. But Norway, asked by the US to help destroy the arms, said it was "not the most suitable location" for the work. At least three children were among the dead and dozens more wounded in Friday's car bombing, UK-based activist group the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. While Suq Wadi Barada was under opposition control, government forces were positioned just outside the town, it said. State news agency Sana said one of the victims was aged seven. It blamed opposition forces, saying the bomb exploded while it was being assembled. Rebel leaders blamed government troops. Car bombs have become a common, deadly occurrence in the long-running conflict. Earlier this week, a truck bomb in the central city of Hama killed at least 30 and wounded dozens more. Observatory figures show the 31-month conflict has killed more than 115,000 people. More than five million people are displaced inside Syria, and another two million have fled the country as refugees, according to the UNHCR. In other developments on Friday, government troops appeared to have ambushed a rebel position near the capital, part of an offensive on rebel-held areas around Damascus. State media said 40 rebels had died, while activists reported 20 deaths. The area is part of Eastern Ghouta region, scene of August's poison gas attack which killed hundreds of civilians and prompted a UN Security Council resolution calling for the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) issued a warning Friday that continuous heavy bombing had forced 130,000 people out of al-Safira in the north. They said aid agencies could not cope with the numbers as winter approaches. "These people arrive in areas that already host a large number of displaced people, where the rare humanitarian players that are present are faced with huge needs," Marie-Noelle Rodrigue, MSF head of operations said in a statement. Fighting has also spread to northern Lebanon. The northern city of Tripoli has seen five days of street battles between supporters and opponents of the Syrian regime, killing five and injuring more than 40. </body>

      <title>Syria: Polio epidemic fears grow</title>
      <description>The number of suspected cases of polio among children in Syria is believed to have risen sharply, with at least 22 people now thought to be suffering from the disease, health officials say.</description>

      <body>At least 22 people - most of them babies and toddlers - are now believed to have contracted polio in Syria, the World Health Organization has reported. If confirmed, it would be the first outbreak of the disease there in 14 years. Syria's Health Ministry began an immunisation drive on Thursday. Before Syria's civil war began in 2011, some 95% of children were vaccinated against the disease. Now, Unicef estimates 500,000 children have not been immunised. WHO said the suspected outbreak centres on the eastern province of Deir Ezzor. "There is a cluster of 22 acute flaccid paralysis cases that is being investigated in that area," WHO spokesman Oliver Rosenbauer told Reuters news agency. "Everybody is treating this as an outbreak and is in outbreak response mode." Two cases have already been confirmed by laboratory tests while the WHO expects final laboratory confirmation on the remaining 20 cases next week. There are more than 100,000 children, all under age five, now at risk of polio in Deir Ezzor province alone, which has been caught in fierce battles between Syrian government forces and opposition fighters. The city of Deir Ezzor remains partially controlled by forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, while the countryside is in the hands of the opposition. The WHO is now working with the UN, Syria's Health Ministry and other agencies on a mass immunisation programme. But it is expected to be a difficult undertaking, says the BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva, given the widespread insecurity and estimates that over half of Syria's medical professionals have left the country. More than four million Syrians have been displaced internally by the conflict and generally live in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. The WHO has already reported increases in cases of measles, typhoid and hepatitis A. Aid agencies are also developing emergency immunisation plans for Syrian refugee camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. "Obviously, we're extremely worried about the situation," Simon Ingram, a spokesman for Unicef's operations in the Middle East, told the BBC. "People are flooding across borders in an uncontrolled manner and this increases the possibilities and means by which the virus can spread." The highly contagious disease is most often spread by consuming food or liquid contaminated with faeces. Polio has been largely eradicated in developed countries but remains endemic in Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Worldwide, polio cases have fallen from an estimated 350,000 at the start of a WHO-led immunisation campaign in 1988 to just 223 reported cases last year. There is no known cure, though a series of vaccinations can confer immunity. Young children are particularly susceptible to paralytic polio, the most serious form of the disease. </body>

      <title>JonBenet parents 'should be charged'</title>
      <description>In 1999 a Colorado grand jury voted to charge the parents of slain child beauty queen JonBenet Ramsey in her 1996 murder, court documents show.</description>

      <body>A Colorado grand jury was prepared to charge the parents of a slain six-year-old beauty queen in her death, newly released court documents in the 17-year-old murder case show. The panel voted in 1999 to charge JonBenet Ramsey's parents with fatal child abuse and "accessory to a crime". But prosecutors declined to try John and Patsy Ramsey on any charges. JonBenet's body was found brutally beaten and strangled in her Boulder, Colorado, home in December 1996. The Ramseys always maintained their innocence. Lin Wood, a lawyer for John Ramsey, said the documents released on Friday meant "absolutely zero" to the investigation. "The documents today are a mere historical footnote, a small glimpse into the grand jury proceedings," Mr Wood said in a statement. "It's four pages of what would have likely been hundreds of volumes of testimony and exhibit." The prosecutor at the time, Alex Hunter, has not commented about the newly released documents. Patsy Ramsey died of cancer in 2006. The investigation into JonBenet's death gained national attention in the US after grisly details of the crime and videos of the girl performing in beauty pageants were publicised. The Ramseys were never charged, and DNA evidence eventually suggested someone else killed the girl. In 2008, prosecutors formally exonerated them in the murder and publicly apologised. Her killing remains unsolved. The release on Friday of the grand jury indictments came after a lawsuit by the Boulder Daily Camera newspaper and the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press (RCFP). The 1999 documents show the grand jury moved to charge Mr and Mrs Ramsey with child abuse resulting in death and with being an accessory to a crime. The documents allege the couple placed their daughter "in a situation which posed a threat of injury to the child's life or health" which led to her death, and then helped the killer evade discovery and prosecution. Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney at the time, declined to sign the indictments, effectively dropping the charges. "I and my prosecutorial team believe we do not have sufficient evidence to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has been investigated at this time," Alex Hunter, the Boulder County district attorney, said in 1999. Analysts say it is uncommon for a district attorney not to sign off on a grand jury decision. US grand juries are convened in secret and tasked with determining whether enough evidence exists to bring a suspect to trial. But prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt in order to convict - a substantially higher bar. JonBenet's body was found in the basement of her home on 26 December 1996 after her parents reported her missing. Her skull was fractured and she had been strangled. The couple offered a $100,000 (£61,700) reward for information about the killer. The Boulder police were also faulted for botching the initial search of the Ramseys' home. In 2008, former District Attorney Mary Lacy publically apologised to the Ramseys after new DNA evidence suggested the killer was not a family member. </body>

      <title>US football great 'losing memory'</title>
      <description>Brett Favre, one of the greatest quarterbacks in American football history, says he suffers from memory loss after 20 years in the violent sport.</description>

      <body>One of the greatest quarterbacks in American football history has said he suffers from memory loss after a 20-year career in the violent sport. Brett Favre, 44, told a broadcaster he had little recollection, for example, of his daughter's sport activities over a several-month period. He questioned the toll that two decades of on-field hits had on his memory. His remarks come amid a national debate about violence in football and its long-term effects on the players. Mr Favre played 321 consecutive games in the National Football League (NFL), most with the storied Green Bay Packers in the state of Wisconsin. He played in two Super Bowl championships, winning one. He retired in 2010. Mr Favre's comments make him the latest in a growing number of former players to come forward in recent years complaining of symptoms of brain injury from repeated knocks on the head. "I don't remember my daughter playing soccer, playing youth soccer, one summer," Mr Favre said. "This was pretty shocking to me that I couldn't remember. That's a little bit scary to me. For the first time in 44 years, that put a little fear in me. "I think after 20 years [of playing football], God only knows the toll." American football players are routinely exposed to injury in the full-contact sport. The quarterback leads the side on offence and can be tackled at high speed several times in a game by large, fast defensive players. Studies have linked repeated concussions with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a malady with symptoms including memory loss and mood swings. Mr Favre's comments come just months after a judge ordered the NFL to pay $765m (£463m) to more than 4,500 former players who sued the league, alleging it concealed the risks of long-term brain damage. The class action accused the NFL of hiding research that had shown the harmful effects of concussions, while glorifying and promoting violent play. </body>

      <title>VIDEO: The wild abandoned railway in Paris</title>

      <body>Long before the Metro, the steam trains of Petite Ceinture ("Little Belt" in English) connected Paris's main railway stations carrying people around the city along the path of its ancient walls. The circular line went into gradual decline from the 1930s, when competition arrived in the form of the more modern underground Metro system. For 32km (almost 20 miles) the tracks of Petite Ceinture snake through bustling Paris, isolated and largely unseen from street level in deep trenches, long tunnels, and bridges. Nature has reclaimed the space and it has become a haven for wild flowers and animals. The line is officially off-limits to the public, but this hasn't stopped many people attempting to explore it. There is now a fierce debate in the French capital about what to do with the tracks and stations of the Petite Ceinture that still remain. A small section opened as a park in August 2013 and the mayoral elections offer competing plans for cycle routes and parks. Associations set up to preserve the space would prefer to see the line reopened for pedestrian services. BBC News joined Thomas Jorion - a photographer who has been documenting the line since 1996 - on a tour of what he calls the last great wasteland in Paris.

      <body>For five years in a row, Iceland has been rated the country with the world's smallest gender gap by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The rating means Iceland is the country where women enjoy the most equal access to education and healthcare. It is also where women are most likely to be able to participate fully in the country's political and economic life. Iceland is joined at the top of the The Global Gender Gap Report, 2013 by its Nordic neighbours Finland, Norway and Sweden. Overall, the gender gap narrowed slightly across the globe in 2013, as 86 of 133 countries showed improvements. However, "change is definitely slow", says one of the report's authors, Saadia Zahidi.

      <title>How do leaders cope with bugging?</title>
      <description>Why world leaders don't like using secure phones</description>

      <body>The most common reaction to news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by the US National Security Agency appears to be world-weary resignation. Followed by a sly suggestion that someone of her experience and stature should have known better. Kurt Volker, former US ambassador to Nato 2008-2009, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme "every country spies" and he could not believe that the revelations were a surprise to anyone. Lord West, a security minister under Gordon Brown, said he had "always worked on the assumption" that people were listening to his phone calls. "I know they jolly well were," he told Today. "I don't think it's surprising that people try and listen. If you are a head of state there are lots of people, not just other states, who are listening. "There are companies, all sorts of people, who want to hear what you are saying and I think you have to be extremely careful." A former senior British diplomat, who did not want to be named, told the BBC News website he always worked on the assumption that his phone calls were being listened to. This could sometimes be turned to the British delegation's advantage, he explained, by reinforcing the message that they were trying to get across in negotiations in supposedly private phone conversations, knowing full well that they would be intercepted. But at the same time, it was worth remembering when reading reports of what the representatives of other nations were saying that they were probably up to the same game, he added. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett recently revealed that Nicolas Sarkozy, the then French interior minister, tried to save time in negotiations over the closure of the Sangatte transit camp by saying he already knew the British position because the French secret service had intercepted unencrypted Home Office emails. But not everyone is quite so sanguine. Clare Short, who made headlines and provoked fury in Downing Street in 2004 when she revealed that the British secret service had bugged the office and telephone of then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, says she was genuinely "shocked" by the Merkel revelations. The former international development secretary also rejects the argument that Mrs Merkel's anger is for the benefit of the German public, many of whom are still haunted by the memory of the Stasi. "I am sure she was very angry and upset. These were her friends and now [she finds] they don't trust her," says Ms Short. Ms Short said she was regularly given intelligence reports about what Mr Annan was saying in the supposed privacy of his office but she became increasingly uncomfortable about this in the run-up to the Iraq war. She recalls the surreal and disturbing experience of chatting to Kofi Annan on her mobile phone and realising that someone would probably be listening in and transcribing every word. She says she can not recall any examples of being handed intelligence reports about what friendly powers were saying to each other on the phone during her time in office, from 1997 to 2003. But she says she was approached by "successive Cs" - the code name for the head of MI6 - offering to spy on the leaders of friendly nations in Africa. "I told them, 'No of course not. We don't want to spy on the people we are working with,'" she tells the BBC News website. She also explodes one popular myth about notorious technophobe Tony Blair - that he did not carry a mobile phone during his years in power. "I don't really believe that," she says, adding that it might be part of Downing Street myth-making: "It makes him more emperor-like." All heads of state, in the Western world at least, will have access to encrypted mobile phones and other secure lines. The problem, for security staff, is convincing world leaders to take the espionage threat seriously. Shortly after taking office in 2008, Barack Obama managed to convince the secret service to let him keep his own Blackberry, despite fears it would broadcast his location and make him vulnerable to hacking. Mr Obama is said to be frustrated about having to live in the White House "bubble", cut off from the outside world and unable to communicate with normal people. The President's Blackberry is often seen on his belt and he is sometimes pictured scrolling through his messages as he travels in his limousine. In France, senior officials have access to a secure intranet and phone network - but the country's leaders are reported to be reluctant to use the slow and restrictive system, which can take up to 30 seconds to place a call. President Francois Hollande is said to have followed predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy by holding on to his personal smartphone. Mobile phones are banned in No 10 - you have to hand them in at the door - over fears foreign powers are listening in. All calls in and out are routed through a secure switchboard staffed by officials - a system which continues when the prime minister is travelling. Downing Street is remaining tight-lipped about the latest bugging revelations. Asked earlier if the prime minister was still using his mobile phone, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: "I haven't seen him use a different one". </body>

      <title>Corden on singing like Paul Potts</title>
      <description>James Corden on becoming Paul Potts</description>

      <body>James Corden talks about bringing Britain's Got Talent winner Paul Potts to the big screen, singing with Keira Knightley and his admiration for Meryl Streep. Corden admits he had his doubts about playing talent show contestant-turned-opera singer Potts in his new film One Chance. "I think my reaction was the same as everyone else's when they hear there's a Paul Potts film," laughs Corden. "I was like 'Really? Are you sure this is a good idea?" But after director David Frankel, of The Devil Wears Prada fame, convinced him the film would focus on the build-up to that famous audition - Potts' journey from a bullied, opera-obsessed young boy to a YouTube sensation - he was in. "It's a sports movie basically, where the sport is... opera," says Corden. Potts was a mobile-phone salesman when he entered and won the first series of reality show Britain's Got Talent in 2007, and the film uses footage of judges Simon Cowell, Amanda Holden and Piers Morgan's genuine reactions to that "watercooler moment". It also boasts British talent such as Julie Walters and Colm Meaney as Paul's parents, MacKenzie Crook as his friend (and manager in Carphone Warehouse) and Alexandra Roach as his love interest. Corden had to practise wearing his clip-in fake "Paul Potts teeth" for six weeks to conquer any lisping - Potts famously got his fixed with his BGT prize money - but they were "tremendously useful" for getting into character. Pulling off Potts' operatic singing voice proved a bit more challenging. "When I said yes to the film I was a little bit bullish and thought, 'I can do this'," reveals Corden. "So they got me some singing lessons with this brilliant teacher in New York. After about eight or nine lessons some producers came down to hear my opera. "I got about a third of the way through Nessun Dorma and they just went, 'Yeah we're going to get someone else to do this'. It wasn't great." So Corden sang "with the microphone turned off" during filming, "and then Paul sort of synched to my lips really". "We were all a little bit worried - will it work, will they buy it?" admits Corden. "Actually you kind of do." The film is backed by Hollywood heavyweight producer Harvey Weinstein, who Corden is said to have impressed while on stage in last year's hit play One Man, Two Guvnors. But he's quick to rubbish internet rumours that Weinstein will be running any sort of Oscar campaign for him. "For this?" he laughs. "I would be very surprised, I can't imagine that will be anywhere close to the case. "We've made a really nice, light, humorous film and I'm immensely proud of it, but I think you can start to get ever so slightly carried away with those sorts of things and I'm definitely not, in any way." It must be hard for Corden to keep his feet on the ground though, when he is currently turning up to work at Shepperton Studios with the likes of Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep. Nine director Rob Marshall has cast him in "a dream of a role", as The Baker in a big-budget film version of Broadway musical Into the Woods. "It's certainly the biggest thing I've ever done. It's ridiculous, I spent a long time just waiting to be fired really," says Corden. "I thought someone would go, 'This is silly, we should get someone who's actually famous'." But he's still in the job, along with Chris Pine, Anna Kendrick and Emily Blunt. However it is Streep who has really impressed him. "I would be a robot if it didn't affect me, I think she's probably the greatest actress alive," he says enthusiastically. "But (the reason) she's so incredible, is that she's just so unbelievably welcoming and encouraging and puts you at ease. (She is) a team player, she encourages a company spirit. I genuinely can't speak highly enough about her." Having misspent some of his youth in various, slightly dubious boybands, Corden can actually hold a tune. He'll be doing so in Into the Woods and alongside Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo in another film, Can a Song Save Your Life?, due out next year. "I play Keira's old friend from home who's a struggling musician in New York. I sing, but I'm not - there's a pattern emerging here - I sing but I'm not very good," he laughs. "Keira's really got the best songs in it - her voice is unbelievable, genuinely. People are going to be so shocked when they hear it. I think it's her best performance. "It's written and directed by John Carney who made the film Once, which I'm a huge fan of. I'm very proud to be in it," says Corden. In fact, these days Corden seems rightly proud of all his work. With flops like Lesbian Vampire Killers and his ill-fated sketch show Horne and Corden better left out of it, he currently has his fingers in many successful pies. New BBC Two comedy The Wrong Mans is a return to form for the Gavin and Stacey co-creator - currently enjoying positive viewing figures and favourable reviews. And co-written with Mathew Baynton, it gives him the chance to do what he likes best: "Being at the seed of an idea, and writing it and shooting it and editing it, seeing it through. That is probably where I'm probably most creatively fulfilled." There's also hosting Sky One sports quiz A League of Their Own, and another year of the Brit Awards in 2014 before he hands hosting duties over to "someone younger and better looking". His plans to return to the stage - "I think in 2015" - sound like they've been mapped out with precision, but Corden denies that is the case. "I've never really had a career plan, which I'm sure won't come as a shock to anyone," he says. "Mainly my plan is to have fun and enjoy it. I couldn't think of anything worse than not enjoying it really." </body>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <body>There's been a wave of popularity for drinks like the Aperol spritz, the Negroni, and a host of cocktails flavoured with "bitters". Why are people turning their backs on sweet cocktails in favour of a bitter taste? The last two decades have seen an extraordinary resurgence in cocktail-making on both sides of the Atlantic, with everything from Cointreau-sweetened Cosmopolitans to sugary Mojitos being drunk in vast quantities. But there is now a definite trend towards bitter drinks. People are ordering whisky or gin-based drinks paired with vermouths. And there is growing interest in the US, UK and other European nations in Italian amari. These complex, herbal, bittersweet drinks, with names like Averna, Ramazzotti, Montenegro and Fernet Branca, are usually consumed as aperitivi or digestivi - drinks thought to either encourage the appetite before dinner or help with digestion afterwards. Their bitter mixer cousins, Cynar, Campari and Aperol, are increasingly being used in cocktails. Aperol - based on bitter orange and rhubarb and containing classic bitter ingredients like gentian and cinchona (a source of quinine) - has rocketed in popularity in recent years following a push by owner Gruppo Campari. Sales rose 156% in the UK in 2012 and 56% in the US. This year's figures, announced soon, are expected to be even bigger. A poster campaign in the UK encourages people to try an Aperol spritz - prosecco sparkling wine and soda water mixed with Aperol. A fundamental point of the spritz is its low alcohol content. Aperol's slogan is "poco alcolico", roughly meaning a little bit alcoholic. "I think the Aperol spritz was probably the most asked-for drink in the outdoor areas of most decent bars in London this summer," says World Duty Free mixologist Charlie McCarthy. Laura Tallo, from Nonna's Italian Cucina in Bath, says many British drinkers have returned after holidays in Italy, having seen certain drinks paired with tavola calda - the selection of hot, freshly-baked food. "People are definitely beginning to embrace the Italian custom of drinking aperitifs. We have seen a definite trend emerging of people choosing classic Italian pre-dinner drinks such as an Aperol spritz, Negroni [equal parts Campari, gin and sweet vermouth], Americano or Martini," she says. Such drinks are not to everyone's taste, of course. While many Italians have been brought up around the tradition of amari, they can baffle non-Italian palates at first taste. "They say of a Negroni the first two or three sips you despise, and after you have had two or three drinks you start to like it," says Tom Ross, bars manager of the Polpo restaurant group in London. The taste of Fernet Branca - vaguely minty but with pungent undertones of cough medicine - is so powerful that comedian Bill Cosby constructed a seven-minute anecdote around his initial horror on encountering the drink in Italy. And yet Fernet is loved by many, being drunk with cola in Argentina and - accompanied by a separate shot of ginger beer - known as the "bartender's handshake" in San Francisco. One of the first recorded definitions of a cocktail was in a New York journal in 1803, which classified it as a mixture of any "spirituous liquor", with water, sugar and "bitters", known at the time as a bittered sling. You can find the descendant of these traditional bitters (with the term typically referring to both singular and plural) in any decent bar in the UK or US. There'll be a rather unusual bottle among the others - small with a yellow top and an oversized label covered in small print. It is the world's most famous cocktail bitters, Angostura. This bitters is the key ingredient in pink gin, the traditional officers' cocktail in the Royal Navy. It's also the bedrock of famous cocktails, including the Old Fashioned, beloved of Mad Men's Don Draper, and the Manhattan. A supply shortage in 2009 caused panic throughout the world's bartending community, according to McCarthy, and prompted bartenders to start making their own. The current wave of speakeasy-type bars inspired by the prohibition years in the US, has prompted interest in traditional and hitherto forgotten cocktails. This in turn has prompted demand for more unusual bitters. Bob Petrie, of Bob's Bitters, started in 2005 when he was approached by the Dorchester Hotel to create a range. Traditional bitters are very complex, with aromatic flavours brought out from a combination of barks, roots, herbs, and spices by macerating them in alcohol. He looked at pairing them with the "botanicals" in gin, and came up with a range including cardamom, chocolate, coriander, ginger, grapefruit, lavender, liquorice, orange and mandarin, peppermint and vanilla. "Single flavours are a lot easier for the barman as it gives a lot more scope," Petrie says. "What they can do with mine is mix and match." Rochdale-born US celebrity mixologist Gary Regan is another who was prompted to make his own to replicate the orange bitters in some old cocktail recipes. "When I realised it was hard to get good ones I decided to make my own. I stole a recipe from the Gentleman's Companion of 1939. I had about four different trials and eventually got something I liked. "This shift towards bitter has been going on for eight years," Regan estimates. "[But] most bitters aren't that bitter. They taste herbal. In fact, they are a bit on the sweet side sometimes." Fee Brothers in Rochester, New York, has been making bitters since 1863, with a short break for prohibition. Joe and Ellen Fee are the fourth generation. Their 92-year-old father still regularly visits the plant. Joe Fee says there has been a marked increase in sales over the past seven years. "Just about anything can be made into a bitters. They are your spice rack behind the bar." "I am the Willy Wonka of the cocktail mixers," boasts Ellen Fee, who conjures up the new flavours. "I like to think in terms of what flavour is already bitter. Cocoa powder is bitter, cranberry is bitter. You add to that and make it more interesting." The plethora of these cocktail tinctures and potions shows the tastes of aficionados have shifted. But there are other flagbearers for a more bitter palate. Many James Bond fans attempt to recreate the Vesper Martini from Casino Royale. Bond asks for it to be made with strong gin, vodka and the bitter Kina Lillet. Lillet took out much of the bitter quinine in the 1980s and fans tend to use Cocchi Americano Italian vermouth instead. And the Queen has followed in her mother's footsteps by drinking gin and Dubonnet - the quinine-bittered French aperitif. Just a few years ago, her choice was seen as unusual. Now she's part of an established trend. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>What is the point of government consultations?</description>

      <body>What is the point of government consultations? I pose the question at the end of a week in which ministers responded to three official consultations on three controversial proposals - and appeared to ignore the results from them all. On Monday, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on planned changes to the assessment of people with disabilities in determining their entitlement to benefits. The government had conducted the consultation, it said, "in a fully open-minded manner". Ministers had carefully considered all the views expressed. The consultation focused on plans limiting entitlement to extra help for mobility needs to those who cannot walk 20m. The overwhelming response was that this was a bad idea. "Respondents felt there was no evidence to support the use of 20m," the consultation reported, pointing out "that other government policies use 50m as a measure of mobility". In a section entitled "What you told us", the DWP notes concern that the plan "could increase isolation and reduce independence, have significant financial impact, and cause deterioration in their physical and mental health". Respondents warned that the 20m criteria would mean some disabled people needing support from other public services, increasing the cost for the government. "The most common suggestion made by respondents", the DWP reports, "was to extend the qualifying distance for the enhanced rate from 20m to a longer distance". Nowhere in the government's response to the consultation is there evidence that anyone thought the 20m criteria was the right policy. "Having considered all these factors", the DWP response concludes, "the government believes that the use of 20m is the best way of identifying those whose physical mobility is most limited". It is, of course, the democratic right of ministers to consult and to listen and then ignore. The arguments put forward by the DWP may be compelling. But it does lead some to ask whether the consultation really had much value. A similar question might be posed following the government's response on Tuesday to consultations on two proposals concerning immigrants. The Home Office published the results of the public consultation on plans for a levy on temporary non-EEA migrants as a contribution towards the costs of possible NHS care while in the UK. It is a move that ministers claim enjoys considerable public support, but the consultation came back with a rather different view. On the principle of a levy, "34% felt that temporary migrants should make a direct contribution to the costs of their healthcare. Sixty-two per cent disagreed," it found. The Home Office notes differences depending upon the "type of respondent". Among the general public, 65% were against the plan. Among organisations that responded, 77% were opposed. Health-sector respondents, however, were in favour - 66% felt temporary migrants should contribute to the cost of their healthcare. It is the view of 235 health sector respondents, representing around 12% of the total, that appears to have swayed ministers most. "We have considered all responses to these questions carefully but remain convinced that only permanent migrants should be automatically eligible for free NHS care." Consultations are not referendums. In a way, it seems odd the Home Office should go to such trouble to quantify the proportions for and against the policy since the exercise is not designed as an X-factor style public vote. But having conducted a public consultation and expressing gratitude to all those "who have taken the time to respond and to those who have contributed their experience and insight to what is a complex issue", one is left wondering what the point was. The government response to a separate consultation, also published on Tuesday, invites the same question. This time the proposal under scrutiny was the introduction of a legal obligation on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. "While between one-third and two-fifths of respondents supported the proposal," the Home Office response states, "slightly more than half of all respondents disagreed." The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors considered it "inappropriate to use private landlords and lettings agents to help deliver the government's immigration policy". The majority of landlord representative organisations were opposed. "The most widely expressed concern by third sector organisations," the Home Office reveals, "was the potential to impact on vulnerable people, such as those who were homeless, those with learning difficulties and those fleeing domestic abuse". The response? "The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation and remains convinced of an urgent need for action to deter illegal migration and to safeguard the legitimate housing market." The consultation may lead to ministers including an amendment designed to counter discrimination against foreign national tenants. But on the broad proposal, it seems the exercise has not shifted government thinking one jot. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), "public consultation is one of the key regulatory tools employed to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation". But there has long been scepticism as to whether such exercises are anything more than cosmetic. The public consultation is an opportunity for ministers to test their ideas with experts, those directly affected and voters more generally. Community participation on proposed legislation is seen as a key component of "citizen power". But formal public consultation exercises very rarely result in a government re-think - even if they reveal profound concern. That is not the point of them, and we should not pretend otherwise. </body>

      <title>Sifting through the data mountain</title>
      <description>What is the use of performance figures to patients?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24651405</url>

      <body>The Care Quality Commission has gathered together a mountain of data. A total of 161 hospital trusts have been assessed against 150 measures from mortality and infection rates to errors and patient survey results. Even taking into account the fact that not all the data was applicable to every trust there is still well over 12,000 bits of data to wade through. So how can patients navigate their way around it? The first thing to say is that this is not a final judgement on hospital trusts. That will come over the next two years as the inspection programme is rolled out. Instead, the CQC has referred to it as a screening tool rather than diagnosis - it is to be used to prioritise which trust to visit first. But that does not mean it cannot and should not be used by patients. What the regulator has done is pull together all the key bits of information already available on performance and provided an analysis of which hospital trusts are furthest outside the expected range. Until the inspection process is complete, it is perhaps the most comprehensive and informative assessment of what is happening in the NHS at the moment. But it does not mean the exercise is fool-proof. That much is clear already. For example, four of the trusts put into special measures earlier this year because of serious concerns about standards did not make it into the highest risk band one category. In fact two (Burton Hospitals and George Eliot) ended up in band three. Although all were subsequently bumped up to band one because of the issues already identified. When the final ratings are produced it is likely some of those judged low risk will get a bad rating, while some of the high risk ones will be given a good or outstanding rating. One of the reasons for this may be related to the fact the different measures have not been weighted for seriousness. For example a trust with a high sickness rate or poor uptake of vaccination among its staff would get the same risk rating as another with a high mortality rate. In some ways, that is understandable. For example, a trust with high absence rates is likely to have a problem with morale and management. That is not good for patients. The problem is that we just do not know yet whether it is an accurate way of risk profiling. The regulator has promised to fine-tune its system as it goes along. Of the first 18 trusts to be inspected, there is an even spread between the top two bands, the middle two and the bottom two. That will give it an early indication of the accuracy of its methods. In the meantime, patients can pour through the individual reports that have been produced for each trust here. There is a summary page of the risks identified, setting out the areas for which the trust has a poor record. It will be up to patients to decide what to do with the information and whether they want to exercise choice where they can. But as one person who is heavily involved in analysing data for the NHS put it to me: "If you can avoid it, why would you go to a hospital where there is much more evidence of risk than another?" </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Unite has been accused of mishandling the negotiations, but the General Secretary of the Scottish TUC, Graham Smith said Unite officials were always prepared to be flexible but were hamstrung by the management's refusal to be reasonable. "I think they've been placed in a very difficult position by an employer who in my experience very uniquely walked away from its responsibilities that it had with the trade union, tried to impose its will on the workforce with a take it or leave it ultimatum," Mr Smith said. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <body>Scottish councils have imposed a pay deal on their staff after almost a year of negotiations failed to reach an agreement. Council staff other than teachers will get a 1% rise backdated to April of this year - and a further 1% rise next April. The decision was taken at a meeting of the council umbrella body Cosla. Cosla said it could not allow the "dragging of feet" by the Unison union to continue. "This cannot continue any longer - our employees deserve their pay rise now," said Cosla's human resources spokesman, Councillor Billy Hendry. "We have been in negotiations with the Scottish Joint Council trade unions for almost a full year after making an initial offer in November 2012. "The unions remain divided and the time has come to apply the deal." Mr Hendry added: "I am particularly pleased with the ground-breaking award of a living wage of £7.50 per hour in 2013/14, which will deliver real benefits for employees at the lower end of the pay scale, and an agreement to match the recommended figure due next month from the Living Wage Foundation for 2014/15, which will see a further living wage increase for the lowest paid." The pay deal does not apply to teachers. Earlier this week the largest teachers' union, the EIS, rejected changes to their terms and conditions of employment. The pay deal was conditional on accepting these changes. Mr Hendry continued: "It is deeply frustrating for me that I am not in a position to announce a pay increase at this time for our teaching workforce. "The decision by the EIS not to agree a deal has resulted in what we believe is an unnecessary delay. "Talks will continue in November which we hope will also bring this matter to a conclusion." </body>

      <body>Floodlight failure at half-time meant the first Highland derby of the season had to be abandoned. With the match poised at 0-0 after a lacklustre opening 45 minutes, Ross County's Global Energy Stadium was plunged into darkness. Inverness had the better of the first-half but referee John Beaton was busiest, issuing five yellow cards. Half-time was extended and although the floodlights briefly came on again, they failed a second time. Ross County chairman Roy MacGregor told BBC Radio Scotland: "We're really disappointed for all the fans, the officials and the players. "And also for you guys, the BBC who've come up to the Highlands for the game. "With the rain today, with all the water, I'm afraid we're not in control of that at all." Referee Beaton told BBC Radio Scotland: "We gave it as long as we could but the third chance was the last chance and when the lights failed we couldn't wait any longer. "It was caused by an overload; the players enjoyed the first half, as did the match officials. We're all disappointed. It gets to the point: how long can we leave them sitting in the dark? "We'd have loved to have finished the game but we'll need to come back again." Inverness manager Terry Butcher told BBC Radio Scotland: "It's just one of those things. "I'm not sure what the reason was but we live to fight another day and we'll come back and do it all again. It's disappointing of course." </body>

      <title>Four jailed over weapons stash</title>
      <description>Four men are jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station.</description>

      <body>Four men have been jailed after a stash of weapons and ammunition - including an Uzi sub-machine gun with silencer - was found at a railway station. Serving soldier William Dempsey left bags of weapons at Carlisle station after getting off a train to Glasgow. He collected them from James Ashdown in Kent. They were destined for Barry Kelly and Craig Colquhoun in Scotland. Dempsey and Ashdown were each jailed for eight years. Kelly was given nine years and Colquhoun seven years. Dempsey and Ashdown had previously admitted conspiracy to buy or sell illegal firearms. Kelly and Darvel were found guilty by a jury of the same offences earlier this month. Liverpool Crown Court heard how Dempsey, 29, from Paisley, left two Army camouflage bags containing the Uzi sub-machine gun, silencer, a handgun and a sawn-off double-barrelled shotgun with two cleaners at the station. He asked them to look after the bags for him as he thought he was being followed. The court heard that the mortarman with the 5th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, was dressed in desert combat uniform and had been exhibiting "somewhat bizarre behaviour". He told staff there were snipers at the station. He had collected the firearms from his friend Ashdown, 32, in Canterbury, where Dempsey's barracks were. The court heard how the bags, found on 17 August last year, also contained Dempsey's identification papers and 194 rounds of ammunition which had his name embroidered on them. They were destined for Kelly, 34, from Darvel, Ayrshire, and Colquhoun, 28, from Barrhead. A search at Dempsey's barracks uncovered a handgun-shaped crossbow, several metal tipped arrows and large military batteries. The battalion duty officer confirmed to British Transport Police that no weapons were missing from the armoury. British Transport Police said Dempsey's mobile phone revealed messages between him and Ashdown regarding large cash payments for "toys" - items believed to be the firearms seized at Carlisle. Further investigation revealed links to both Colquhoun and Kelly. On 16 August last year Colquhoun was captured on CCTV at the Royal Bank of Scotland in Paisley paying £3,500 into Dempsey's account. While arresting Kelly, Ashdown and Colquhoun police found £20,000 hidden in the loft of Kelly's house. Prosecutor Nicholas Kennedy said it was not known where the Uzi and handgun were from but the shotgun had been stolen in a burglary at farm buildings in Maidstone in February 2007. Sentencing the four, Judge Robert Warnock said: "I am wholly satisfied that they [the weapons] were destined for use in serious crime and had a clear potential for causing serious injury and death. "Had these firearms reached their intended recipients, I have no doubt they would have significantly contributed to the upward spiral of gun crime in this country." The judge told Demspey he had used his uniform to hide what he was doing on the day he was arrested. "For reasons principally to do with your abuse of alcohol and drugs, you abandoned the firearms at Carlisle station," he said. "I make it clear, however, that these actions were not motivated by remorse or insight but your befuddled and confused thinking brought on by your alcohol and drug abuse and your consequential paranoia and instability." The judge told Kelly he was "clearly a relatively sophisticated criminal who is well-versed in the use and abuse of mobile phone technology". He said his "employee" Colquhoun was a peripheral player in the conspiracy. The court heard that Ashdown, of no fixed address, was an active street dealer of drugs who was motivated to make money to fund his cocaine habit. He was jailed for an additional three years for possession and intent to supply cocaine in a separate case. Mitigating for Dempsey, David Thompson said his client had joined the Army at the age of 17 and had served in Northern Ireland, Iraq and Afghanistan. He was described as a "reliable and competent soldier" but his life began to go downhill last July. He had alcohol and drug problems and had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after his battleground stints. At the time he entered the firearms conspiracy he had accumulated a drug debt of £5,000. Mr Thompson said he was exposed to influences in his home town of Paisley - which he had joined the Army to get away from when he was younger. He said Dempsey "in effect abandoned the consignment at the rail station and disappeared into town." "He tells me he knew he was going to be arrested and was enjoying a final pint of beer." Mr Thompson said it was "a crying shame" that the defendant had become involved in a conspiracy "diametrically opposed" to the 12 years of service he had given to his country. "He is filled with remorse for getting involved and the shame he has brought upon his regiment," the barrister said. The court heard that Kelly maintained his innocence. Following sentencing, Det Ch Insp Simon Taylor, who led British Transport Police's investigation, said: "These four clearly intended to put illegal firearms on to the streets of Scotland and it is a fair assumption that they would have been used to commit criminal acts or to intimidate people. "In uncovering and unravelling the complex conspiracy BTP, in partnership with Kent Police and Police Scotland, have taken this potential threat out of circulation and ensured the conviction of four dangerous men." </body>

      <body>Two brothers have been convicted of killing a man after a feud between rival kebab shops turned violent. Azeem and Zeeshan Aslam were found guilty of culpable homicide after the fatal attack on Anthony Dryden in March. The 42-year-old was battered to death after smashing a window at the Aslams' family takeaway shop in Airdrie. One of the pair was later heard boasting how Mr Dryden had been "fixed". Sentence was deferred. Azeem and Zeeshan Aslam - aged 26 and 23 respectively - had both stood trial at the High Court in Glasgow accused of murder. But a jury found them guilty of the reduced charge of culpable homicide. The killing brought to a head a dispute between the Ali's Kebabs shop, which was owned by the Aslams, and the owners of the nearby Nico's restaurant, where Mr Dryden's aunt worked. This included claims of a fire attack, extortion and other threats. The jury heard how Hamid Shah applied to set-up Nico's takeaway in the same street as Ali's Kebabs. The Aslam family objected to the council, but permission was eventually granted and Mr Shah began renovating his premises. However, Mr Shah and his employees became targets of intimidation even before his shop had opened. Prosecutor Murdoch MacTaggart asked Mr Shah: "Did that bother you?" He replied: "Yes, my shop was set on fire as well. I reported it to the police." It was also alleged the Aslams demanded £150 a week or Nico's would be burned down. Mr Shah told the jury one of the brothers later passed his shop and made a chilling cut-throat gesture. Asked what he thought this meant, the witness added: "It is because they are competition and they are trying to scare me." Windows at Nico's were also then smashed on two occasions. On 23 March this year - the day of the killing - Ali's Kebabs was then struck in an apparent revenge attack when Anthony Dryden broke a window. Mr Shah told the jury he was not behind it but that one of his workers - an aunt of Mr Dryden - had mentioned it as the "police were not doing anything". Mr Shah said: "She did suggest it, but I said no. She said it two or three times, but then I said it is up to you what you want to do." The jury heard how the Aslam brothers raced out of their shop and chased Mr Dryden into a back garden nearby. Azeem Aslam repeatedly hit Mr Dryden with a baseball bat while his brother struck the victim with a piece of wood that had been lying on the ground. The pair then fled leaving their battered victim to die. Azeem Aslam was later heard saying: "Fixed that guy - even broke the baseball bat." Mr Dryden, of Motherwell, suffered serious skull and brain injuries from which he did not recover. Azeem Aslam testified during the trial and admitted there had been "tension" between the two takeaways. He recalled hitting Mr Dryden "four or five times" that day, but only in self defence. He claimed the victim had a hammer. Azeem Aslam insisted: "I had to do it - I had no choice." But prosecutor Mr MacTaggart said Mr Dryden was the one defending himself as the brothers came at him in a "pincer movement" with "weapons raised". The advocate depute went on: "Mr Dryden just gave up and accepted that he was going to get a beating. That's what he got from you and Zeeshan." The accused denied that was the case. Judge Lord Stewart deferred sentencing for reports until 21 November at the High Court in Edinburgh. </body>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <title>Yacht crash Navy officer guilty</title>
      <description>A Royal Navy officer from Perthshire who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker is found guilty of contravening maritime regulations.</description>

      <body>A Royal Navy officer who was skippering a racing yacht that hit an oil tanker in the Solent has been found guilty of contravening maritime regulations. The Atalanta of Chester, belonging to Lt Roland Wilson, of Stanley, Perthshire, collided with the 260m-long Hanne Knutsen during Cowes Week 2011. The 32-year-old was convicted at Southampton Magistrates' Court of impeding the passage of a vessel. He was also found guilty of failing to keep a proper lookout. Mr Wilson, who was a serving Royal Navy officer at the time but is now a lieutenant in the reserves, had seen the tanker from five miles (8km) away, the court heard. It had been making its way to Fawley oil refinery. Wilson had told the court the ship had signalled to turn but never did, describing its manoeuvre as "unexpected". District Judge Anthony Callaway said he took the wrong decision in continuing towards the path of the tanker and not taking evasive action. The moment of impact was filmed and the video posted on YouTube, where it was watched more than 924,000 times. Mr Callaway said: "Fortuitous it was that there was no loss of life. The potential for even greater and tragic consequence is, in my judgement, apparent. "This was a serious yacht crewed by serious people in a regatta for a serious purpose. It was well equipped in terms of experience and ability to deal with any situation. "This was not some Saturday afternoon jaunt by some inadequate vessel crewed by inexperienced, clueless and foolhardy people who frankly have no business being on the water at all. "The yacht took a decision, and as I find the wrong decision, to sail towards the problem into the path of the tanker across a narrow channel. It should have kept clear and in the worst event used her engine." The judge said conditions in the Solent were crowded due to Cowes Week but the yacht's crew were experienced enough to perform the "difficult manoeuvre". He added: "The fact it didn't do so was the product not of a lack of skill, but the product of the wrong decision at the wrong time, for which the skipper, Roland Wilson, must take responsibility." Cowes Week sailing director Stuart Quarrie witnessed the collision from the shore. He said: "It developed very quickly and at the time, there was no idea if anyone was seriously hurt. "Thankfully, the injuries sustained were relatively minor. "I don't think there's any long-term damage to the relationship between the regatta and the port authorities from this incident because of the professional manner in which it has been dealt with." Mr Wilson was ordered to pay a fine of £3,000, and costs of more than £100,000. The yacht, which had a crew of eight, suffered a damaged mast and its sail almost became entangled in the anchor of the Hanne Knutsen. One crew member suffered minor head injuries and another abandoned ship after the collision with the 120,000-tonne tanker. Mr Wilson was convicted of one count of failing to keep a proper lookout and two counts of impeding the passage of a tanker in a restricted channel. </body>

      <title>Sharp rise in council's rent arrears</title>
      <description>North Lanarkshire Council claims more than 2,000 of its tenants are in rent arrears for the first time after housing benefit changes.</description>

      <body>More than 2,000 people in one part of Scotland have got into rent arrears for the first time since changes to housing benefit were made in the spring. North Lanarkshire Council thinks it is owed £675,000 from tenants because of the spare room subsidy - dubbed the bedroom tax, by critics. The council is the largest local authority landlord in Scotland. It also believes many people who could be eligible for help to deal with their benefit cut have not applied for it. This is the most detailed assessment so far of the impact of the changes on one council area in Scotland. More than 5,000 council tenants in North Lanarkshire lost some of their housing benefit in April because they were deemed to have spare bedrooms. An analysis produced by the council - covering the six months up to September - said 2,333 tenants who previously had no rent arrears owed the authority money by September. A further 1,100 already had rent arrears before the changes took place. This meant that 3,449 of the 5,201 people who lost some of their housing benefit in North Lanarkshire had rent arrears. Overall, rent arrears over the past six months were up by two thirds compared to the same period last year though the council was stressing the changes to housing benefit were only one reason for this. Tenants now owe the council more than £2.5m in total. The council said about £675,000 of these arrears could be the result of the benefit changes. However, the council also believes that some people who could have been helped by the special discretionary housing payments, available to those affected by the benefit changes, may not have applied for them. This means that some of the arrears may have been avoidable - or that there could have been help for people who have struggled to make up for the loss of benefit. North Lanarkshire said it would not evict tenants solely because of spare room subsidy arrears during this financial year as long as they had contacted the housing service for assistance and advice. A spokesman said: "Clearly the UK government's welfare reforms are already having a significant effect on our tenants. "The council has set aside funds to assist vulnerable people in every way possible but it is essential that tenants who are worried or in difficulty talk to us. "We have hired additional trained advisers who can discuss each case and provide help with applications for financial assistance. We have already helped thousands of people, so anyone who needs that assistance should contact their local housing office." Council leader Jim McCabe condemned the UK government's changes to housing benefit but urged people who have been affected to speak to the council to see if help could be provided. The council has nearly £1.2m available to hand out in these payments - £470,000 of it is from the UK government, the rest is from the council's own budget. So far it has paid out £350,000 in these payments to nearly 2,900 people. Separate figures from the council give some indication of the scale of the arrears that individuals are building up. As of last week, about 460 people have arrears equivalent to the cut in their benefit while 500 have built up new arrears since April of an even greater amount. The other tenants with arrears appear to have tried to make up some of the shortfall or have received help. The Scottish Conservatives' welfare spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said the figures showed that the issue of welfare reform was not as black and white as the Scottish government, and what he called the "left-wing establishment", would like to make out. Mr Johnstone said: "Welfare reform is a challenge that must be addressed so that it is fair to those who receive, and fair on those who pay for it. "The ever-growing cost of the welfare budget is something which successive governments have failed to address. "But the 'ignore the problem and it might go away' approach simply hasn't worked and has only resulted in fostering a culture of people being left to languish on benefits for years." A spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said: "Scotland has been given £10m this year to help vulnerable people and we are monitoring this spending carefully to ensure that tenants get the support they need during welfare reforms. "It is important to remember that housing benefit will still cover the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for spare bedrooms. "People have a number of options available to them, including moving to another property in the public or private sector, or making up the difference in rent through going into work or working more hours." Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess said: "We know that 80% of households affected by the bedroom tax contain an adult with a recognised disability, and over 15,000 children are affected. "That's why have consistently expressed our opposition to this measure. "The Scottish government is doing all it can to help the people hit by the bedroom tax, with £20m of funding available this year and a further £20m available next year." </body>

      <body>Glasgow's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum is showing 14 new acquisitions in a major redisplay of Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Glasgow Style works. The eight purchases and six donations add new metalwork, ceramics, glass and stained glass to the collection. They include pieces by David Gauld, Archibald Knox, Alexander Ritchie and Christopher Dresser. The redisplay also features other works from Glasgow's civic collection which have not been on show for decades. The eight purchases were made with financial support from The National Fund for Acquisitions administered through National Museums Scotland, the Art Fund and The Heritage Lottery Fund. Councillor Archie Graham, chairman of Glasgow Life, the body which runs Kelvingrove Museum, said the city had "arguably one of the finest civic collections in Europe" thanks to help from partner bodies who helped with funding. "Together we have been able to bring beautiful works by important artists, several of them born in our great city, to the millions of people who visit Kelvingrove every year," he said. "This new display provides plenty to marvel at and an opportunity to learn a little more about their influences and techniques." Glasgow Life said the new acquisitions "reveal the skills, experimentation, influences and imagination" of artists working across Britain between the 1880s and 1930s in the Glasgow Style or part of the wider Arts and Crafts movement. One of the new items on show is a stained and leaded glass panel entitled 'Music', which was designed by Glasgow Boy David Gauld. The piece was made by the Glasgow stained glass workshop of Hugh McCulloch and Company around 1891. Another new exhibit is a copper kettle by Christopher Dresser, a pioneer of the British Design Reform Movement, dating from about 1880 to 1885. This piece was made by Benham and Froud of London. </body>

      <body>A family tribute has been paid to a "wonderful" woman who died in an Aberdeenshire crash. Margaret Laing, 79, lived near the scene of Monday's crash on the B977 Dyce to Fintray road. Her son, Alan Laing, said: "She was a wonderful mother, grandmother, aunt and friend." He said his mother had devoted her life to caring for other people and was full-time carer for her husband. Mr Laing explained: "She grew up in the Inverurie area before training as a nurse and working at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and Aberdeen Children's Hospital. "We are all absolutely devastated by her death. She will be sadly missed by all who knew her." A 50-year-old man has appeared in court charged with causing death by dangerous driving in connection with the crash. Edward Shaw, from Inverurie, was also charged with drink-driving. </body>

      <body>The wife of a security guard charged with murdering a conference delegate at Glasgow's SECC complex has told his trial he has a violent temper. Paula Carter told the High Court in Glasgow that she had called police on a number of occasions about her husband Clive's outbursts towards her. Carter, 35, denies murdering Khanokporn Satjawat, 42, from Thailand, at the Clyde Auditorium on 12 November 2012. He has admitted killing her while suffering diminished responsibility. Mrs Satjawat died while attending a conference for HIV drug therapy at the Clyde Auditorium, which is part of the SECC complex. She sustained massive head and facial injuries after being battered with a fire extinguisher in a female toilet. Carter, from Motherwell, North Lanarkshire, was working as a security guard at the venue at the time of the incident. He has claimed he has no memory of the killing or alleged attempts to cover it up. During evidence on Friday, Mrs Carter said her husband could be violent but denied saying that he was manipulative. The witness was asked by advocate depute John Scullion, prosecuting: "Is your husband manipulative, does he manipulate you?" She replied: "No." Mr Scullion referred to a statement in which Mrs Carter allegedly said her husband was manipulative. He asked her: "Does it say: 'If Clive doesn't get his own way he's like my eight-year-old. He stamps his feet, breaks stuff. He's manipulative.' Did you say that to the police?" Mrs Carter replied: "I don't know." The prosecutor accused Mrs Carter of "choosing not to remember." She replied: "Please don't put words into my mouth," then added: "I can't remember." Asked if her husband had ever strangled her, Mrs Carter said he had done so once. He showed her a police statement taken on 13 January in which she stated: "I didn't have any marks or bruises. He just strangled me to the point of going red and then he let me go." Mr Scullion asked: "Did you say that to the police?" Mrs Carter replied: "I don't know, I don't know what the context is. I don't remember the conversation. I can't remember saying that." She did admit to the jury that Carter often had episodes of explosive rage where he would throw things at her. These items included a coffee table and a laptop. She told the jury: "He threw whatever was to hand." She also revealed that on one occasion when he could not find a tin opener he wrecked the kitchen. Mrs Carter said: "The only thing left standing was my microwave." She denied trying to protect her husband, adding: "I don't excuse what my husband has done at all." She also told the prosecutor: "You are trying to portray me as a battered wife. I'm not, I give as good as I get." She told defence QC Ian Duguid that after the violent explosive incidents Carter could not remember what he had done. The witness added: "Once when he pushed me to the ground in a rage he came back into the room and said what are you doing on the floor. He didn't realise what he had done until I told him." The QC then asked: "Is he able to control himself when he's in one of his explosive rages?" She replied: "No." Psychiatrist Dr John Crichton told the jury that he believed Carter had an emotionally unstable personality of the impulse type. The trial before judge Lord Matthews continues. </body>

      <title>Funding boost for Scotland women</title>
      <description>Manager Anna Signeul believes a new funding agreement for the women's game is a "game-changer" for Scotland.</description>

      <body>Manager Anna Signeul believes a new funding agreement for the women's game is a "game-changer" for Scotland. A Scottish Government initiative will provide £200,000 to cover the qualifying period for the 2015 World Cup and allow players to work less. "This is going to have a major impact on the day-to-day lives of these players," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "They are training 15 to 20 hours a week and that is hard to sustain on top of 40 hours work." Scotland have never reached a major tournament, having missed out on the last two European Championship finals at the play-off stage. The majority of Scotland players currently fit their football commitments around full-time work or study and the new financial support will allow for more recovery time as well as more strength and conditioning sessions. "To reduce the work load and be able to rest a little bit more and maybe get some more training time, it's going to make a huge difference," Signeul told BBC Scotland. "Some of the players had already made the decision to work part-time but not everyone can afford to do that." Midfielder Kim Little is one of the few Scotland players to earn a wage from playing and she also welcomes the new injection of money. "I'm very lucky to be at Arsenal and to be able to focus mainly on my football," she said. "It's definitely helped me a lot. "For Scotland to move to the next level, this is definitely the way to go. "You can see the difference funding has made to the England team. They are a very good side now - in the top four in Europe. "In terms of fitness and technique, giving the girls more time to train will improve our national team - without a doubt." Scotland are seeded second in their World Cup qualifying group, behind Sweden, and have opened with high-scoring wins against the Faroe Islands and Bosnia. The Scots host Northern Ireland on Saturday and travel to Poland next week. Meanwhile, Signeul is on a shortlist of 10 candidates for Fifa's Women's Coach of the Year award, with the world governing body describing Scotland as "a quiet success story". </body>

      <body>A Scottish health board has uploaded a short film to video sharing website YouTube in a bid to recruit new staff. The video promoting vacancies in NHS Highland's cancer treatment services is the first in a series the board plans to produce to attract new employees. In the six-minute film, workers seek to dismiss misconceptions about the Highlands. Last month, NHS Highland was unsuccessful in a second attempt to fill seven GP vacancies. In the YouTube film, several members of staff talk about what the health board and the Highlands have to offer. They say Inverness's Raigmore Hospital, which has a vacancy for a consultant oncologist, has cutting edge technology to match larger city hospitals. Raigmore has also led the way in the use of image guided radiotherapy, staff point out during the film. The employees have also sought to dispel mistaken ideas about the region. Steve Colligan, head of radiotherapy physics, says: "I think people do believe the Highlands is a bit backwards and not up-to-date and I think it's important to reassure everyone that we have running water and electricity." Dr Carol MacGregor, a Macmillan consultant in clinical oncology, adds that the area offers a wide range of activities that do not involve "Gortex and wellies". The Scottish government has supported the use of video to help attract potential recruits to NHS Highland. Health Secretary Alex Neil said: "I am acutely conscious of the challenges we all face in providing high quality, sustainable healthcare - particularly for those who live in remote and rural communities." He added: "Initiatives such as this film produced by NHS Highland will help to promote the benefits of living and working in Highland." The closing date for applications to the consultant oncologist post is next month. NHS Highland has been facing challenges in recruiting staff to some posts. A renewed effort to fill seven GP vacancies in a remote part of the Highlands was unsuccessful, it emerged last month. NHS Highland re-advertised the posts in the sparsely populated area of West Lochaber after a first round of adverts failed to attract enough applicants. The health board had hoped a new plan for a cluster of local practices would have allayed potential applicants' concerns about having to work alone. But not enough people have come forward to staff that model of cover. The GPs are needed to cover places such as Arisaig, Acharacle and Strontian. </body>

      <body>Two men who spent almost £7,000 with an OAP's credit card have been told to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Soham Emmanuel, 21, from Glasgow, pled guilty to duping Catherine Black, 86, into handing over her card and PIN. He also admitted fraudulently obtaining a Macbook, two iPads and other goods totalling £4,200 from Tesco stores. Nouman Chaudhary, 20, also from Glasgow, admitted fraud charges, and charges of theft by taking money out using the card, totalling £2,659. At Glasgow Sheriff Court, both men were told to carry out the unpaid work as part of a year-long community payback order. The court heard how Mrs Black agreed to hand her card over after being contacted at her home in Clydebank, West Dunbartonshire. On 26 June last year, Emmanuel went with another other man to collect the card at Mrs Black's home. It was accepted by the Crown that he sat in a car and did not go to the door, but that he knew why he was there. After obtaining the card, Emmanuel, from Drumchapel, went on a spending spree, buying a Macbook, two iPads and other goods from various Tesco stores. The court heard that the following day, the card was passed to Chaudhary, from Pollokshields. He also bought a number of goods, including two laptops and cigarettes, and withdrew cash using Mrs Black's card. Both men were caught after Mrs Black spoke to a family member about what had happened. The registration of the car used during Chaudhary's shopping trips was traced and both accused were found in the car along with "incriminating articles". The court was told that the bank compensated Mrs Black for her loss but the unrecovered loss from both accused amounted to about £4,000. </body>

      <description>An Argyll seafood firm wins a legal ruling against a local rival over who can trade from green-painted premises.</description>

      <body>An Argyll seafood firm has won a legal ruling against a local rival over who can trade from green-painted premises. John Ogden and Marion Ritchie said their green shack on Oban Pier lost business after being confused with Gordon MacGillivray's green mobile van. A judge has now granted an interim interdict preventing Mr MacGillivray from running a nearby firm from "wholly or predominantly green" premises. Lord Pentland said it was open for Mr MacGillivray to contest the decision. The Court of Session in Edinburgh heard that the shellfish business run by Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie had been mentioned by "a considerable number of contributors" to the Trip Advisor site as being a green shack or hut or something of that nature. An entry in the Lonely Planet guide had also described it as "the green shack on the quayside". The court heard that Mr MacGillivray had traded for some years, but from a white kiosk. Recently his business has been run from a new green-coloured catering outlet. Paul O'Brien, counsel for Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie, told the Court of Session in Edinburgh: "Ultimately what the pursuer is seeking is for the defender to repaint. "The pursuer is suffering a loss of trade from the confusion generated by the presence of the defender's other green outlet. "It is in a position on that pier where potential customers will reach it first. Although it is not strictly a hut, it certainly is a small portable retail outlet." The judge ruled that Mr Ogden and Ms Ritchie had succeeded is showing that they had a case, at first view, based on passing off in the intellectual property action. Lord Pentland granted the partners in Girl Norma Shellfish, an interim interdict against Mr MacGillivray, of MacGillivray's Seafood. Under the terms of the order he is prevented from passing off any bar or restaurant on or within 250 metres of the railway pier in the town as being theirs. It particularly prohibits Mr MacGillivray from carrying on such a business from a kiosk, hut, shack or similar structure that is "wholly or predominantly green". The judge said a number of specific instances had been given in which confusion has arisen because of the presence of two green seafood facilities on the pier. Lord Pentland said a prima facie case was made out by the shellfish business that they have suffered and are likely to continue to suffer financial loss due to the confusion. The judge said he did not think it would be right to dismiss "any such diversion of trade" as minimal. </body>

      <body>A Care Inspectorate order to close Clachnaharry House care home in Inverness could be reviewed. Earlier this month, the watchdog ordered operators RDS Healthcare to shut the home because of concerns about the quality of care provided. The company was given 14 days to ask the inspectorate to review its decision. A spokesman for the watchdog confirmed a request for a review had been received and would be considered. NHS Highland suspended its admissions to the home in November 2012. The Care Inspectorate then served the care home with an improvement notice after raising concerns about the state of flooring and bathrooms. It also highlighted issues over staffing levels and record keeping. RDS Healthcare has plans to close the home temporarily at the end of December to carry out refurbishment work. However, the Care Inspectorate wants more immediate action taken. </body>

      <body>Inverness Caledonian Thistle posted a modest gain of £22,000 on the financial year to 31 May; the club's first profit since 2007. The results are a marked improvement on last year's deficit of £379,000. Last season, the Highlanders enjoyed their highest ever placing in the top flight, finishing fourth, despite trimming the wage bill for players. And the club say they continue to operate without any long-term debt or overdraft facilities. There was no cash generated by player sales, with Owain Tudor Jones and Andrew Shinnie among those leaving the club under freedom of contract, but clinching fourth-place resulted in a healthy increase in prize money after a 10th-place finish in 2011/12. Revenue was also boosted by a run to the League Cup semi-finals. "At the start of this financial year, the board in conjunction with the management team had to make some serious cuts to the playing budget following consecutive years of losses which, though manageable, could not be sustained in the long term," said chairman Kenny Cameron. "It is testament to the shrewdness and undoubted skills in 'talent spotting' of Terry Butcher and Maurice Malpas, ably assisted by head scout Steve Marsella, that, having made the cuts in the playing budget, the team excelled under their leadership." Caley Thistle's turnover for this financial year was £3,721,192 compared to £3,443,053 the year before, while administrative expenses were down £111,000. "Our strategy and business model have served us well," added Cameron. "We have substantially reduced our cost base. We have excellent people and a robust strategy that will ensure we continue to improve as a club and a business and strive for the long-term sustainability of the company. "We have improved our balance sheet position from a £60,000 negative in 2012 to a healthy £238,000 positive position, a key health check in any business." The balance sheet money was raised by generating extra share capital. </body>

      <body>The consortium of international companies that owns and manages Dounreay Site Restoration Limited (DSRL) is changing its name. From next week Babcock Dounreay Partnership will be called Cavendish Dounreay Partnership. The consortium is overseeing DSRL's work decommissioning Dounreay, an experimental nuclear power complex on the north Caithness coast. The site's original buildings such as its dome are to be demolished by 2025. The rebranding follows the decision of Babcock International Group, which has a 50% stake in the parent body organisation, to call its civil nuclear business unit Cavendish Nuclear. The other partners in the consortium, CH2MHILL and URS, as well as the rest of Babcock International Group, are unaffected by the change. </body>

      <body>Fines are to be introduced next month for vehicles which are parked inappropriately or for too long at Borders General Hospital. From Monday, motorists will receive a "friendly warning". However, that regime will only last four weeks before penalties begin to be imposed. NHS Borders said it remained committed to providing free parking but that the present situation was actually putting people at risk. From 25 November, £90 fines will be issued to those who leave cars in "inappropriate" places - such as outside spaces, on kerbs, on chevrons or in ambulance bays - reduced to £40 if paid within 14 days. The car parks nearest the hospital will be designated for short stays with a four-hour limit for both patients and staff between 08:00 and 17:00. Monday sees the start of a four-week transitional period before the fines are brought into force. </body>

      <body>The chairman of a council social work committee has said the authority faces a "challenge" in finding the resources to meet demand for its services. Andy Ferguson was speaking after a report showed a rise in the deficit facing the Dumfries and Galloway Council department to £205,000. Savings of some £1.1m also need to be found by March next year. Mr Ferguson said he believed the fact that services were working well could create extra budget pressures. He said finances could always be put under strain by surges in demand. "We cannot give guarantees - we do not know what is going to come through the door," he said. "There was an increase in children, for example, who have been diagnosed on the autistic spectrum. "We are identifying earlier and dealing with earlier the problems that some children have." He said better awareness, improved working between agencies and early identification had to be a "positive thing". "It does create a challenge for the politicians in how we actually get the resources to meet that need," he added. </body>

      <body>Staff at Stirling Council have called off industrial action which was set to take place from Monday. The two-week bin collection strike was suspended after the council and unions agreed to re-enter discussions over terms and conditions. A meeting between the council and the GMB, Ucatt, Unison and Unite unions will be held on Monday. A joint statement said the action had been suspended to allow for negotiations. The dispute has centred on the council's plans for a 0.5% pay cut across all pay grades and an additional hour of work per week. A revised offer which included a guarantee to restore the pay cut, and implement a national 1% pay rise, at a future date was rejected by the unions earlier this month. The unions said the changes did not address the key issues of working more hours and changes to terms and conditions. The council has said the changes are necessary as it needs to make savings of £24m due to a real terms cut in the funding it receives from the Scottish government. </body>

      <body>The 60th anniversary of one of the most tragic days for the RNLI in Arbroath is to be marked this weekend. Six crewmen died when the Robert Lindsay lifeboat was struck by a huge wave close to the harbour on 27 October 1953. Only one man survived. They had been searching for a vessel in distress. Their lives will be commemorated by the local community and the current RNLI crew who will be laying a wreath at sea on Sunday. David Bruce, Harry Swankie, William Swankie, Thomas Adams, David Cargill and Charles Cargill all died in the tragedy. The only survivor was Archibald Smith, who was able to hold on to a rope thrown across the boat by watchers on land. A plaque with the names of the crew is displayed in the Arbroath lifeboat shed in remembrance of the disaster. Alex Smith, the lifeboat operations manager at Arbroath, said: "It is the darkest day in our history here at Arbroath lifeboat station and the sacrifice of those lost has been, and continues to be, an inspiration to generations of crewmen. "Unfortunately, it also serves as a stark reminder of the risks that volunteer lifeboat crews face to help others at sea." Church services will also be held in Arbroath on Sunday to mark the event. All-weather lifeboat RNLB Inchcape will be launched at 15:00 for the wreath-laying ceremony. </body>

      <body>Nicola White has been named as the winner of the 2013 Dundee International Book Prize. Her crime thriller novel, In the Rosary Garden, beat competition from more than 350 entries. The book is inspired by a notorious true case from the 1980s of infanticide in Ireland. The Irish debut novelist has been awarded a publishing deal and a cash prize of £10,000. Her entry was chosen from a final three by a judging panel comprising of Brian Cox, Lorraine Kelly, Norman Foster, Claire Alexander and AL Kennedy. The two runner up titles were Mango, written by Jeff Hayden, and What to do with Lobsters in a Place Like Klippisfontein, by Colette Victor. The ninth winner of the competition, which has been running since 2000, was described by judge AL Kennedy as "courageous and intelligent". Previous publications Although In The Rosary Garden is Nicola's first novel, her short stories have been published widely and broadcast on radio. Last year she was Leverhulme Writer in Residence at the University of Edinburgh and was the 2008 winner of the Scottish Book Trust New Writers Award. The author grew up in Dublin and New York and now lives on the Clyde coast. She previously worked as a contemporary art curator, in Glasgow, and produced arts programmes for BBC radio and television. The decision to award the prize to Ms White was praised by crime novelist Val McDermid who called the book "mesmerising".

      <title>Body raises post-vote pension issues</title>
      <description>Debate about pension provision in an independent Scotland still lacks clarity in key areas, according to the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.</description>

      <body>Debate about pension provision in an independent Scotland still lacks clarity in key areas, according to a professional body. European status and what currency would be used were among the main issues at stake, the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries (IFoA) suggested. The Scottish government published a paper last month on pensions, if independence is backed. It said the basic state pension would still be paid "on time and in full". The document added that from 2016 new pensioners would be given £160 a week - making them £1.10 better off than those in the rest of the UK. The people of Scotland will vote in the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September next year. They will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country." Martin Potter, leader of the Scottish board at IFoA, said: "Scotland becoming an independent country would have a significant impact on financial services, including pensions and insurance, the regulation of the sector and its future growth. "As an independent professional body with a Royal Charter, the IFoA has a public-interest duty to uphold. "In raising questions that it believes to be pertinent, the IFoA looks to serve the public interest by informing the debate on these important issues ahead of next September's referendum. "Whether a referendum results in an independent Scotland or not, it is right that discussion about how change could affect Scotland happens now. "Across the sector, we are still limited by the lack of clarity to date on the status of an independent Scotland in relation to the EU and the many financial implications of that uncertainty, all of which need to be considered." The paper looks at challenges facing financial services and at cross-border schemes, raising concern about the future of underfunded pension plans. In April, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland said changes to pension rules with Scottish independence could force substantial costs on employers with unfunded schemes. European directives mean UK-wide schemes would be deemed "cross-border" and need to be fully funded, the body said. The reported stated: "This is as important a subject for rUK (the rest of the UK) as it is for Scotland. "Many employers based in rUK have Scottish employees. For those companies and their staff, a definitive view on this matter would be very welcome. As such, the matters highlighted within this section would apply to all post-independence cross-border schemes." </body>

      <title>Rent arrears up since benefit reform</title>
      <description>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study.</description>

      <body>Rent arrears owed to housing associations and local authorities rose in the three months after the spare room subsidy was abolished, according to a study. The Scottish Housing Regulator (SHR), has published research on the early impact of the measure, which has been dubbed the bedroom tax by critics. It said arrears increased by £789,000 in the period to the end of June 2013. It comes against a background of rising arrears in the past two years. SHR said the report, based on feedback from almost 85% of social landlords, gave the fullest available picture of the early effects of welfare reform on Scottish landlords' rent arrears. Iain Muirhead, the regulator's director of strategy and communications, said: "We want to get more information and see a fuller picture before we would draw any firm conclusions on what is happening and why. "Our research establishes a baseline and we will repeat it each quarter and report the findings." But the Early Impacts of Welfare Reform report revealed that the level of arrears had reduced during the period between March and June in each of the previous two years. In 2011 it fell by £3.5m and by £2.8m in 2012. The report said the total amount owed in rent at 30 June 2013 was £63,125,355, although this included amounts carried over from previous years. It said most landlords were facing the same problems in dealing with the effects of welfare reform. They identified increased workload and income reduction as their two biggest challenges. Support, advice and information to tenants featured prominently in the actions landlords were taking to address the early impact. David Ogilvie, policy manager for the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, said the report provided concrete evidence of a worrying trend. "This heralds tough times ahead for Scottish social landlords - be they housing associations, co-operatives or local authorities - as they face the twin challenges of increasing service delivery costs and reducing income. "Both of these challenges arise directly from welfare reform." The benefit changes form part of a revamped system. Under the new housing rules, 14% will be deducted from housing benefit for one "spare" bedroom and a quarter for two or more. The government says the changes should ensure that people are in suitably sized accommodation and release larger accommodation for people who need it. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70705000/jpg/_70705133__52287135_000006818-1-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time. The franchise is due to start in February 2015 and is expected to run for a maximum of 11 years. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Since 2009, the line has been run by Directly Operated Railways, an arms-length company overseen by the Department for Transport. Figures in Friday's document suggest total journeys on the line have increased by a million to 19.1 million under public ownership while revenue has risen by 11% to £692m. In the year to October 2013, 89% of East Coast trains arrived at their final destination within 10 minutes of their advertised time, compared to a national average of 92%. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC the firm had done a "good job" but the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "There is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned nearly £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 393-mile London to Edinburgh route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. "We think it should be allowed to get on and act as a public sector comparator for the other rail franchises," shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh told the BBC News Channel. Asked why Labour had changed its policy since 2009, when it said public ownership was temporary, she argued the facts had changed. "We have been very surprised and happy with the directly operated railway...We think, at the very least, it should be able to bid for this franchise." The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. But the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks on behalf of commercial train operators and Network Rail, said the rail network had been transformed under such a public-private business model. "This partnership is a winning formula that is delivering for passengers, businesses and the taxpayer," said the group's director general Michael Roberts. Consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said it would be scrutinising the tendering process very carefully. "It has never been more important that companies are publicly held to account for their passenger satisfaction ratings - these must be built into the very heart of the contract," said its chief executive Anthony Smith. "However, it is good to see the franchise process moving ahead again and unlocking much-needed investment." </body>

      <title>Scottish Power raises prices by 8.6%</title>
      <description>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% on dual-fuel energy bills in the same week as being hit by a penalty for its sales tactics.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24650695</url>

      <body>Scottish Power has announced a price rise of 8.6% for dual-fuel energy bills from 6 December. The company said it would increase gas prices by 8.5% and electricity prices by 9%. The move comes amid political wrangling over the issue of energy bills, with the government planning to review the green levies that form part of a bill. On Monday, Scottish Power was hit by an £8.5m penalty for misleading doorstep and telephone sales. The price rise would lead to a £113 increase in the average annual dual-fuel bill to £1,424, Scottish Power said. It will affect about 2.2 million Scottish Power customers. However, different areas of the country will face different price increases. For example, the rise will be 10.2% on average in southern England, but 7.3% in some areas of Scotland. Scottish Power is the fourth of the six major energy suppliers to announce price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November, British Gas said prices for its customers would go up by 9.2% on 23 November, and Npower announced the biggest rise of 10.4% which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power echoed the views of other suppliers by suggesting that the price rises were the result of the rising wholesale cost of energy. The cost of delivering energy to people's homes, and the rising cost of the government's environmental and social schemes were also to blame, it said. Neil Clitheroe, chief executive of energy retail and generation for Scottish Power, said that there were a number of costs - such as windfarm payments - that did not exist 10 years ago, but which affected bills. "With an increase in costs for delivering compulsory schemes to reduce carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency in homes, we unfortunately have no other option than to pass these on by increasing our prices for customers," he said. "We understand that these are difficult times for many families, and we have done what we can to hold our prices for as long as possible. Recently we announced a range of measures to help our most vulnerable customers this winter. "We will now write to every customer who will be impacted by the price increase, and we would encourage anyone who is concerned to contact us so we can discuss their options." Ann Robinson, of price comparison website Uswitch.com, which would benefit from people switching supplier, said: "Unfortunately, the floodgates have opened and it looks like consumers are going to be buffeted by suppliers in very quick succession." Iberdrola, the Spanish parent group of Scottish Power, said that its UK operations had been affected by tight margins, as well as by energy efficiency and environmental measures imposed by the regulator. "As a consequence, generation and supply is now loss-making, and leaves the company no option but to increase tariffs," it said. There has been considerable political debate over the price rises. Labour leader Ed Miliband has pledged a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election and has been on the attack over the issue. Subsequently, Prime Minister David Cameron said that there would be a review of the green levies charged to companies that are included in bills. He said this accounted for £113 on an average bill - the same amount as Scottish Power's subsequent price rise announcement. The review will be followed by a competition test for the energy market to establish how it is functioning. The Liberal Democrats called the idea a "panicky U-turn" by Mr Cameron, although Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg later said some of the environmental policies could be delivered in a more cost-effective way. On Tuesday, former Conservative Prime Minister Sir John Major called for a windfall tax on excess profits made by the largest suppliers. On Tuesday, energy firm bosses will give evidence to a committee of MPs about the price rises. Between August and December last year, the "big six" energy companies introduced price rises of between 6% and 10.8%. Earlier this week, the regulator, Ofgem, said that Scottish Power customers were misled during sales approaches due to the firm's failure to "adequately train and monitor" staff. The company apologised for the errors between 2009 and 2012, and has set up a £1m compensation fund for customers who believe they were victims of mis-selling. It said it would also pay £7.5m to the 140,000 customers it has on the government-led "warm home discount scheme" aimed at supporting customers who are likely to be at risk of fuel poverty, as part of the penalty. </body>

      <title>Glasgow 6-13 Munster</title>
      <description>JJ Hanrahan scores all Munster's points as they come from behind to displace Glasgow at the top of the Pro12 table.</description>

      <body>Munster celebrated a hard-fought win over Glasgow by replacing the Scots at the top of the RaboDirect Pro12 table. Duncan Weir's brace of penalties had the Warriors 6-3 ahead at the break. But Munster back JJ Hanrahan pierced the home defence for the game's only try and his precision with his right boot put the Irishmen in charge. Glasgow tried hard to save their 100% record in the competition this season but they could not produce the killer move to penetrate the Munster defence. Weir, in for Ruaridh Jackson at stand-off, scored an early penalty to take his Pro12 points tally to 400. And he could have doubled Glasgow's advantage when Munster were penalised for coming in from the side. However, his long-range effort clipped the outside of the post and went wide. The visitors were awarded a penalty of their own and Hanrahan smacked an almighty kick from the halfway line to level after 20 minutes. Glasgow enjoyed some free-flowing rugby for a short while, with Byron McGuigan and Sean Lamont making impressive incursions into the Munster half before one of the visiting players used his hand to scoop the ball out of the middle of the scrum. The crowd looked on as Weir put Glasgow 6-3 ahead with a straightforward penalty. Chris Cusiter captained the Warriors in the absence of lock Al Kellock and his quick decision-making set up two good attacks in succession, first by Sean Maitland and Tim Swinson, then through Weir and Mark Bennett, the latter recently called up to the Scotland training squad for the autumn Tests. Munster skipper Peter O'Mahony had the men from the south of Ireland moving into Glasgow territory with intent but too often his team was penalised for taking a shortcut when they became involved in the rucks created by the Scots' aggressive tackling. This kept Weir busy with his trusted right boot and, in conjunction with Glasgow having the better of the exchanges at the line-outs, Gregor Townsend may have been disappointed that the half-time advantage was a mere three points. Any sense of regret deepened when Munster went ahead within a few minutes of the restart. They had the put-in at a scrum when Glasgow were penalised for a knock-on and quickly worked the ball out to the right. Hanrahan evaded a series of half-hearted tackles and darted in at the post for the first and only try of the game. His conversion from wide on the right was almost as impressive. And the complexion of the game changed further when Tyrone Holmes gave away a penalty in front of the posts, far too inviting for Ireland Under-20s star Hanrahan to miss. Glasgow responded well to being 13-6 down and pressed Munster to within a metre of their own try-line, with 19-year-old second-row forward Jonny Gray in among the black and blue-shirted players trying to level the score. Welsh referee Ian Davies showed a yellow card to James Cronin for foul play as tempers frayed and Glasgow chose to go with the scrum, which they had edged in the previous 50 minutes, rather than kick for three points from close range. Josh Strauss had three attempts to cross the line and Swinson one, but the outnumbered Munster side defended manfully. In a pause in the attack, Holmes, Bennett, Ryan Grant and Cusiter made way for Jerry Yanuyanutawa, Niko Matawalu, Chris Fusaro and Argentine centre Gabriel Ascarate. However, Munster withstood the next wave of pressure and the home fans began to contemplate their 10-game winning streak at Scotstoun being ended. Glasgow fans' favourite Matawalu had the 5,726 crowd on their feet with a trademark darting run before he was flattened and Weir added to the sense of a fightback with a marvellous kick to within two metres from inside his own half. The Warriors failed to capitalise on that, though, and there followed a tense period when the tackling intensified and Glasgow probed the red line knowing that should they concede again they would be beyond a converted try to draw the match. Matawalu became the focal point of the increasingly desperate Glasgow attacks and despite four minutes of constant attacks in added time they could find no way past a determined Munster defence. Glasgow: Maitland, Seymour, McGuigan, S Lamont, van der Merwe, Weir, Cusiter, Grant, MacArthur, Low, Swinson, Gray, Harley, Holmes, Strauss. Replacements: Matawalu for Cusiter (55), Yanuyanutawa for Grant (55), Hall for MacArthur (61), Welsh for Low (61), Fusaro for Holmes (55). Not Used: Ryder, Jackson, Bennett. Sin Bin: Welsh (75).

      <description>Willem Nel's late try helps Edinburgh pick up their second win of the Pro12 season with victory over Treviso.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh picked up their second win of the Pro12 season by beating Treviso in a mediocre match. Greig Tonks scored a first-half try and Willem Nel added one after the break, with Greig Laidlaw kicking both conversions and two penalties. Treviso stuck to their task and were worthy of the losing bonus point. Luke McLean's second-half try was converted by Tobias Botes who, along with James Ambrosini, also kicked a penalty for the visitors. Edinburgh, who move to 10th in the RaboDirect Pro12, dominated territory and possession but individual errors made for a difficult night. The hosts made a focused start from receiving the kick-off but when their success in retaining the ball through many phases seemed to be on the point of reward, Laidlaw lost the ball forward in going over the line. However, Edinburgh were not deterred and further crisp passing ended with flanker Dimitri Basilaia putting full-back Tonks over in the corner. Harry Leonard converted from touch. The game had already been rendered stop-start by a series of injuries before Edinburgh's high scoring winger Tim Visser went down, tackled in midfield, and referee Alain Rolland immediately stopped play. After a prolonged break, Visser was taken from the field on a stretcher - and his involvement in Scotland's forthcoming autumn internationals looks highly doubtful. Edinburgh continued to dominate possession but were let down by errors when they entered the danger zone. Treviso had the chance to pull back three points; Edinburgh failing to release visiting full-back Brendan Williams when his dodging run was stopped - but Ambrosini's kick missed. However, the Edinburgh drop out was charged down, Treviso remained on the attack and when Edinburgh went offside Ambrosini slipped the easy kick home. Another Edinburgh attack foundered on an error but Treviso brought down the resulting scrum so the half finished with Laidlaw's penalty and the hosts went in leading 10-3. Edinburgh raised the level of second-half play and were rewarded with a penalty kicked by Laidlaw. Soon after, Treviso drove a lineout and the subsequent pressure ended with a try from McLean, converted by Botes. McLean kicked Treviso's second penalty to tie the scores - but with six minutes remaining Nel burrowed over for Edinburgh's decisive second try and Laidlaw converted. </body>

      <body>Inverness boss Terry Butcher revealed he was in the toilet at half-time when the power failed, cutting short the first Highland derby of the season. Despite attempts to get the floodlights at Victoria Park working again, the Premiership game was abandoned. "It was one of those things and you knew it wasn't going to happen," Butcher told BBC Sportsound. "We're bitterly disappointed because I thought we did alright in the first half and looked the likelier to score." With the game goalless at the break, the stadium was plunged into darkness when the floodlights failed. "We got a knock on the door (at half time) and whoever was coming through was going to get a right mouthful from me because I was in mid-flow in my speech (to the players)," said Butcher. "It was the referee, who said there was a delay because the lights had gone off. Then, when we'd come out for the warm-up, the lights were back on. "It was one of those things and you knew it wasn't going to happen. We're bitterly disappointed because I thought we did alright in the first half and looked the likelier to score. "I felt if we could continue that in the second half we'd go on and win it. "But we'll never know now." Butcher also expressed disappointment that the two bookings his side earned - for Ross Draper and Gary Warren - would both count despite the derby being abandoned. "I can't understand for the life of me why they should count," said the Inverness boss. "The result doesn't stand so the bookings shouldn't stand. "There were a few crunching tackles but generally it was a game played in a good spirit and very competitive. "It was bubbling up nicely for a good second half and I'm as frustrated as anyone else that we couldn't finish it off. "It's just one of those things; there's been a lot of rain but I don't know what the reason was. It was just unfortunate but we live to fight another day and we'll do it all over again." </body>

      <body>There were a few cheers, a few hoots on the horns of cars and tankers, but this victory was bittersweet. The 1,370 Ineos staff had been forced to swallow the changes to pay, pensions and conditions which they had fought so hard to resist. The reason for their change of heart was clear. Grangemouth was in danger of becoming another Ravenscraig. Not for two decades had Scotland faced such a serious threat to its industrial base. Why? Because this complex matters. It supplies 70% of the fuel to Scotland's filling stations and much to Northern Ireland and the North of England too. It provides power to a vital North Sea pipeline. And, according to the Scottish government, it contributes around £1bn per year to the economy, the equivalent of some 6,500 full time jobs. Ineos had repeatedly warned that the refinery would not be able to carry on without the petrochemicals plant. And so, when the workers faced the cameras with smiles, it was in the knowledge that, just the previous day, half the complex was closing and the other half was in peril. "We were staring into the abyss," said 53-year-old Grangemouth worker John Convery, who added: "I feel very, very pleased. For myself personally, my family and my colleagues. But there's a lot of people who were very, very worried." That view was shared by one of the younger workers here, Ilolo Adigwe. "Hearing that the plant was going to shut was really worrying for everybody," she said. "So now we've got good news, everyone is happy to go back to work." Eddie Heaney, 59, gave a broad grin as he described the decision as "absolutely fantastic". "It's a chance for a new beginning, because if the management and the union can develop trust then this plant's got a great future," he said. In Grangemouth town centre the mellow voice and gentle guitar of Stuart Miller echoed around the shopping arcade. "Let it shine on" the busker sang, and it seemed to suit the mood. Almost every business for miles around depends on the plant. They had looked over the cliff and were grateful to have been pulled back. "I'm delighted at the news today," said Mr Miller, who admitted he had been "gutted" the day before. "I don't think the unions have covered themselves in any glory here," he added. That is a view shared by plenty of people around the plant, particularly among the 2,000 contractors who have lost work as a result of the dispute. Gerry Finn, who runs a bakery in the town, said: "We do rely on Ineos workers and the contractors to come in. It's a big deal for me." He said he was delighted with the settlement. But some contractors may not get back into the complex as quickly as they would hope. The founder of Ineos, Jim Ratcliffe - who made a flying visit to his plant on Friday evening - has warned that it could take until Christmas to fully fire it up again. But it could have been so much worse. Grangemouth was in danger of becoming a byword for the biggest blow to British industry in decades. Instead the town survives and hopes now to thrive again. Just before lunchtime, the workers poured out of the plant, relief etched on their faces. </body>

      <body>It is reputedly the most haunted highway in Scotland. The A75 in Dumfriesshire is said to have had more reports of supernatural activity than any other road in the country. Now a Dumfries-based group of paranormal investigators has collated the stories for a ghostly Halloween road trip on Saturday night. The Kinmount straight on the road is the most notorious spot for sightings. John Hill, of Mostly Ghostly paranormal investigators, said: "So much has happened at this spot. "A quick search of the internet would bring up the A75 as the most haunted road in Scotland and some say Britain. "There are so many different things have happened on this road and been seen by so many different people as well." Mr Hill and Mostly Ghostly founder Kathleen Cronie have researched the road's supernatural history to compile the first ever ghost coach tour of the road. They have some spine-chilling accounts to relate. "There have been screaming hags, eyeless phantoms and a menagerie of unearthly creatures witnessed on this famous road," said Ms Cronie. She said one of the most infamous sightings was made by Derek and Norman Ferguson, in 1962. "They were driving along here and the whole incident began with a large hen flying towards the windscreen of their car," she said. "They then witnessed great cats and various other creatures as well as witnessing a phantom furniture van - which is a bit unusual to say the least." Bob Sturgeon lives beside the A75 and used to run a roadside snack van - at Carrutherstown, near to the sighting "hotspot". "There was very rarely a week went past without somebody telling me about some experience and usually along that Kinmount straight," he said. His business was a frequent early morning refuge for traumatised lorry drivers who had parked overnight in nearby lay-bys. "They weren't the kind of people who would talk to each other," he explained. "They were long-distance drivers - they were well separated - so it wasn't as if there was a group of them gathered in a pub and passed round stories. "Most of these things were all just individual experiences." A common sighting was groups of dejected bedraggled people pulling handcarts or carrying bundles like some medieval camp followers. One man was so shocked, he gave up lorry driving altogether and Mr Sturgeon never saw him again. "He had been parked on the Kinmount straight and he had woken up at the back of three in the morning and he saw this 'parade' of people," he said. "He said that it went on for ages and he had just frozen - he was in an awful state. "It doesn't matter if you blame it on imagination or fact or whatever, it certainly affected him badly." Documented reports of ghosts on this road go back at least 50 years. As well as seeing assorted animals, horsemen and carriages, some drivers have been convinced they have run over people - phantom figures of men, women, couples emerging from the dark. Saturday night's ghost tour is for Halloween but it is likely to be repeated several times a year, for those with the stomach to listen to the stories and the nerve to face the possibility of a spooky experience of their own. </body>

      <title>Electric dreams: Life off the Grid</title>
      <description>Family lives life off the Grid</description>

      <body>In the shadow of a power line undergoing a £600m revamp is a family of six with no connection to the National Grid. A BBC documentary recorded a year in their lives. For 19 years the Pococks have lived off the electricity grid, on a croft at Cougie in Glen Affric in the Highlands. They are fiercely proud of where they live and about being self sufficient. The family grows its own food - they have two dairy cows, pigs, sheep, geese, ducks and hens. Mum Sasha, 36, runs a pony trekking business while her 42-year-old husband, Iain, supplements the household income by gathering and selling scrap metal. The couple's four children - Sarah, Ryan, Ewan and Douglas - help with the running of the croft and pitch in looking after the livestock and the trekking business's 19 horses. The effort to heat and light the crofthouse, however, dominates family life. The croft is not connected to the National Grid and the family gets its electricity from a generator and a small wind turbine. But when diesel levels are low and the wind does not blow, the TV and domestic appliances are out of action and the children have to do their homework by candlelight and head torches. With a lack of power comes great responsibility. Iain carries out regular maintenance to the diesel generator and wind turbine, while the children spend a cold and wet Saturday gathering firewood. Tonnes of timber are needed to keep the house warm in winter. Iain's mother, Val, also lives on the croft. She and her family moved from Cardiff to Cougie in 1962 seeking an alternative to city life. Sixty percent of her pension goes on paying for fuel. The Pococks say they cannot get grants to install a larger turbine or solar panels because the funding requires surplus power to be exported to the Grid. Ironically, the croft is close to a massive multi-million pound electricity project. Energy giant SSE is upgrading the 137-mile (220km) Beauly to Denny transmission circuit. The 400,000-volt line will triple the capacity of the existing system, and eventually transmit vast amounts of energy from planned renewable power schemes in the Highlands to central Scotland. Six hundred new towers are being built - a reduction of 200 on the existing number. However, some towers are taller and reach heights of 65m (213ft). Opponents to the upgrade have complained that the new towers will spoil mountain landscapes. The project is expected to be completed in 2014 at an estimated cost of £600m. Sasha says the upgraded line is a blot on the landscape and, in return for having to live with it, her family should get some help getting mains electricity. "We live here in a croft at the end of the glen in the middle of nowhere, and we love it," she says. "We chose to live here. It's a great place to raise a family." But while she and her family thrive in the glen's wild, wide open spaces, Sasha is desperate for a reliable source of power. Seeing work being done to the Beauly-Denny line only fuels her quest for it. Tending to a ewe and her young lambs on a hillside overlooking the croft, Sasha's eldest child Sarah admits some people frown at her family's lifestyle. She said: "One of my friends goes to me: 'Oi, you don't look like a hillbilly, but you live like one'. And I go 'yeah, I suppose you could say that, but we're not quite though'." For Sarah there is a big distraction from the family's electric dreams. She has left school for university and swapped Glen Affric's quiet dark nights for the bright lights of Edinburgh. Power to the Pococks; A year in the life of a crofting family is a Timeline Films production. It will be shown on Thursday on BBC Two Scotland from 21:00. </body>

      <body>The Scottish Sun says axed Grangemouth staff have been thrown a 24-hour lifeline after bosses agreed to review a decision to shut the plant. According to the Daily Record, the future of Scotland's biggest industrial site lies in the hands of just one man, Ineos founder Jim Ratcliffe. Billionaire Ratcliffe, says the Herald, has not commented on Unite's u-turn over the ultimatum that its 800 workers must accept a wage freeze and the end of their final salary pension scheme. The Scotsman reports that the Ineos chairman is expected to decide today whether to revive a rescue deal for the plant. In the Press and Journal, the last survivor to escape from the wreckage of a helicopter which plunged into the North Sea reveals he still has nightmares about the disaster. </body>

      <title>UK growth fastest for three years</title>
      <description>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show, the fastest growth since 2010.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70705000/jpg/_70705133__52287135_000006818-1-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>UK economic output rose by 0.8% between July and September, official GDP figures show. The Office for National Statistics said there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. The data builds on a 0.7% GDP rise in the April-June period and is the best quarterly performance since 2010. Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne tweeted: "This shows that Britain's hard work is paying off and the country is on the path to prosperity." Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said the figures "show that we are firmly on the road to economic recovery". The ONS data for construction was up 2.5% over the quarter, the second successive quarter of growth after a volatile performance over the past year. The BBC's chief economics correspondent, Hugh Pym, said: "This could signal that a recovery in that sector is really under way." House-builders have been buoyed by the Government's Help to Buy scheme, which recently launched a new phase offering mortgage guarantees. The ONS said that production grew by 0.5%, though this remains 12.8% off its 2008 level, while within this, manufacturing improved 0.9% in the third quarter. The services sector, which represents three-quarters of economic output, grew by 0.7%. Output from services is now 0.4% above its pre-crisis peak in the first quarter of 2008. Friday's figure is the first estimate, and could be revised up or down in subsequent months. Mr Osborne told the BBC: "It shows that we are on the path to prosperity. Lots of risks remain, so we have to stick with the economic plan that has got us this far. "What's encouraging about these figures is that it's not just services that are growing. Construction is growing and manufacturing is growing." Shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: "After three damaging years of flatlining, it's both welcome and long overdue that our economy is growing again. "But for millions of people across the country still seeing prices rising faster than their wages, this is no recovery at all." Despite the further evidence that recovery is gaining hold, some economists remain cautious. The Institute of Directors' chief economist Graeme Leach said: "The outlook looks better than at any time since the onset of the financial crisis. Indeed, our members have more confidence in the economy than at any time since 2008. "However, strong headwinds remain and the annual growth rate year on year is nothing to get too excited about yet. Though inflationary pressures are likely to remain benign, debt and inflation are rising faster than earnings. "By far the biggest challenges remain on the supply side, not the demand side. Supply side constraints mean that the current growth spurt is unlikely to extend beyond next year. "This stage of our economic recovery is likely to be short and sweet, instead of long and strong." The director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, John Longworth, said: "This is the highest quarterly increase we've seen in three years, so the economy is clearly moving in the right direction. "But we are still behind a number of advanced economies, such as the US and Germany, that have managed to recover the output lost during the economic downturn. "Much more needs to be done to transform our economy from being good to being really great." Samuel Tombs of Capital Economics said the figures confirmed the UK was enjoying "a period of healthy and well-balanced growth". He said it was likely that the UK recorded the fastest quarterly growth rate within the G7 countries in the third quarter. But he added that a squeeze on real incomes as wage growth lagged behind inflation, together with the fiscal squeeze and a stagnant eurozone, were likely to prevent recovery gathering much more pace. It echoed remarks by Bank of England governor Mark Carney on Thursday evening, when he said in a speech that the rate of growth was "towards the top end of the advanced economies", but "coming from a very very low base". </body>

      <title>Grangemouth plant to stay open</title>
      <description>The Grangemouth petrochemical plant near Falkirk is to stay open after a new deal was struck with workers.</description>

      <body>Political leaders and unions have welcomed news that the Grangemouth petrochemical plant is to stay open after a deal was struck with workers. Operator Ineos had announced on Wednesday that the plant was to shut, with the loss of 800 jobs, after union members rejected a survival plan. But the decision was reversed after the union agreed to Ineos's conditions. Ineos founder and chairman Jim Ratcliffe said it was "a victory for common sense". He confirmed Ineos would now press ahead with plans to invest £300m in a new gas terminal at the site, following a "significant change in attitude" from the Unite union. He added: "We have had assurances from the union yesterday that the changes we have requested in order for us to invest in that facility have been agreed and we are delighted to announce that Grangemouth will restart today, both the refining and petrochemicals side." The announcement on Grangemouth's future was greeted by huge cheers from the workforce, who had gathered at the plant to be told the news. The move brings to an end a bitter dispute with the Unite union which began over the alleged mistreatment of a Unite official and escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. Unite has been accused of mishandling the negotiations, but the General Secretary of the Scottish TUC, Graham Smith said Unite officials were always prepared to be flexible but were hamstrung by the management's refusal to be reasonable. "I think they've been placed in a very difficult position by an employer who in my experience very uniquely walked away from its responsibilities that it had with the trade union, tried to impose its will on the workforce with a take it or leave it ultimatum," Mr Smith said. Reacting to the announcement, Unite Scottish secretary Pat Rafferty said: "Relief will ring right round the Grangemouth community, and across Scotland today. "Hundreds of jobs that would have been lost can now be saved and £300m will be invested into the plant." The main points of the Ineos announcement included: First Minister Alex Salmond described the development as a "tremendous fillip for the workforce and the whole Grangemouth community, following what could have been a potential disaster". He said it had been "a great team effort from all concerned", including the unions and workforce, the management and governments. "I am delighted that people have rallied round to protect these jobs, and now we can all agree that Grangemouth has an outstanding future," he added. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael also welcomed the announcement, saying that it was "the news that we all wanted". "The staff and their families have been through a very stressful and uncertain time," he added. The announcement came as BP said it had reached an agreement with Ineos which would ensure that oil and gas supplies from the Forties Pipeline System would be secured. The pipeline - which brings oil and gas ashore from more than 50 North Sea fields - as well as BP's processing plant at Kinneil depend on steam and power from Grangemouth. BP said "some key commercial terms" had been adjusted in an existing deal with Ineos, but did not elaborate. It added: "By doing this, we have ensured that over a third of the North Sea's total oil and gas supplies will be unaffected, and that our motorist and airline customers will enjoy supply security." Ineos' future plans at Grangemouth include investing £300m in a new gas terminal at the site. Grangemouth chairman Calum MacLean said: "It is a huge investment and that investment was only rightly to be done if we had a long-term sustainable base. "What we have now done is given the chemicals business another 15 to 20 years on the back of new raw materials, new contracts and significant investment." Mr MacLean would not dismiss the prospect of redundancies, but said they would be "very limited". The company has also said that 2,000 contractors it laid off after shutting down the complex would be re-hired to support investment in its survival plan. According to Ineos, the Scottish government has indicated it would support its application for a £9m grant to help finance its gas terminal plans, while the UK government has given "pre-qualification approval" for a £125m loan guarantee facility. Falkirk Council, which had planned to set up a task force to respond to the threatened closure, said the Ineos announcement was "the best possible outcome for all concerned". Council leader Craig Martin added: "There has been a tremendous effort behind the scenes to secure the plant's future involving UK and Scottish governments and Falkirk Council, working together to ensure the plant's survival. "This partnership approach has paid off and a more stable and positive future for the workforce has been delivered." </body>

      <title>Jack Straw to quit at next election</title>
      <description>Jack Straw is to stand down as Labour MP for Blackburn at the next general election, he announces.</description>

      <body>Jack Straw is to stand down as MP for Blackburn at the next general election. The former Labour home and foreign secretary, 67, was elected in Blackburn in 1979 and has stood in eight general elections in the constituency. He said his "love affair" with the town was "not going to end on 7 May 2015, nor is my connection with it." Labour leader Ed Miliband paid tribute to Mr Straw's "eloquence and wisdom", and former Prime Minister Tony Blair said he was a "true Labour giant". Mr Straw said: "Whatever national position I have held, the citizens of this town, and their children, have always been my first priority. "I am deeply grateful to everyone in the town for the faith which has been placed in me." But he said he had made the decision to stand down after a great deal of thought and consultation with friends and family. He added he "couldn't go on forever" and it would be "a terrible wrench" to stand down. Mr Straw held the positions of home secretary, foreign secretary and leader of the House of Commons under Mr Blair. Mr Blair said Parliament would "lose one of the most able politicians of my generation" in 2015. He said: "Jack Straw is a true Labour giant. "I was lucky enough to have him in Cabinet throughout my time as prime minister, where he put his brilliant mind to work on two of the most challenging briefs: home and foreign affairs. "Jack's contribution to law and order in Britain and this country's standing in the world is quite simply formidable." In June 2007, Mr Straw was made justice secretary by Gordon Brown, a position he held until Labour's defeat at the 2010 election. Mr Miliband said: "Jack Straw will be greatly missed from the House of Commons. "On behalf of the Labour Party, I want to thank him for his nearly 35 years service as an MP, his achievements in government and his eloquence and wisdom. "He is Labour through and through, and always displayed this in his words and deeds. "He will be sorely missed but I know he will continue to serve our country in many different ways." Mr Straw practised as a criminal barrister before entering the Commons and was an adviser to Labour minister Barbara Castle, his predecessor as Blackburn MP. </body>

      <description>The government's welfare changes for disabled people are delayed after ministers say reassessments take longer than planned.</description>

      <body>The government's welfare changes for disabled people in England, Scotland and Wales have been delayed. People will move from Disability Living Allowance to the Personal Independence Payment next week in only certain areas instead of the whole of Great Britain. Work and pensions minister Mike Penning said the process of reassessing people was "taking longer than expected". Shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said it was the "latest example of chaos" in the department. Claimants will remain on Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for the time being except those in Wales, the East and West Midlands and East Anglia who will transfer to Personal Independence Payment (PIP) from Monday if their conditions change. The government said the need for the alteration "only came to light at the beginning of October as a result of our ongoing analysis of the introduction of PIP" and this would ensure it could be handled "in a more gradual, controlled and manageable way". In a written ministerial statement, Mr Penning said: "Introducing natural reassessment gradually enables us to test the claimant reassessment journey. "This is in line with the way we have been introducing all our other programmes of change and we have made it clear that we would take a controlled approach to introducing PIP, learning lessons from live running." The government has said reform of disability benefits is essential because of the massive rise in its cost. Ministers point out that the number of people claiming DLA has increased from about one million to 3.3 million since it was introduced in 1992, and it costs the taxpayer £13bn a year. Ms Reeves said PIP followed the government's Work Programme and Universal Credit schemes in being beset by difficulties. She said: "The delivery problems we are seeing at the Department for Work and Pensions now risk descending into farce. But for thousands of disabled people who are already extremely anxious about the changes, this is no joke. "Not only is David Cameron's government out of touch but it's increasingly incompetent." Disability charity Scope said the move was just a "tweak" and still believed the whole reassessment process was "too blunt an instrument". The adjustment to the timetable will not affect people in Northern Ireland. </body>

      <body>A spat between two former Conservative leaders continues after Iain Duncan Smith mocked Sir John Major's support for a "cones hotline" in the 1990s. Relations between the two men have been cool ever since Mr Duncan Smith led opposition to Sir John over the Maastricht Treaty on EU integration. On Tuesday, Sir John took a swipe at Mr Duncan Smith's welfare reforms, saying his "genius was unproven". Now Mr Duncan Smith has hit back in an interview in the Evening Standard. Asked about Sir John's comments, Mr Duncan Smith told the newspaper. "Well, as I say, I never really get too fussed about what people think about their own intellects. "I'm always happy to be in awe of someone whose own intellect delivered us the cones hotline, I must say." The cones hotline - a telephone number for motorists to ring if they were irritated by unattended road works - was one of the most mocked policies of the Major government. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith insisted to the BBC it was a throw away line and meant as a joke. There has been little love lost between the two men since, as a backbencher in the early 1990s, Mr Duncan Smith was one of a group of rebels who fought a long parliamentary campaign against the Major government's decision to sign up to the Maastricht Treaty - regarded as a landmark moment in European integration. The battles, which resulted in the Major government facing a confidence vote in the House of Commons, undermined Sir John's authority and led to the prime minister calling his opponents "bastards". He repeated the phrase in a speech to an audience of political journalists on Tuesday, saying his use of the word was "unacceptable" but "his only excuse was that it was true". In the speech, Sir John also questioned the likely outcome of Mr Duncan Smith's sweeping programme of welfare changes. "Iain Duncan Smith is trying to reform benefits," he said. "I truly wish him well. But it is enormously complicated and unless he is very lucky, which he may not be, or a genius, which the last time I looked was unproven, he may get some of it wrong." Mr Duncan Smith's Universal Credit is seen as one of the most ambitious, and potentially risky, policies the coalition has embarked upon. Chancellor George Osborne has denied reports in a recent book by the journalist Matthew D'Ancona that he had questioned whether Mr Duncan Smith had the intelligence to run a major department like work and pensions. Referring to the matter recently at the Tory conference, Mr Duncan Smith pointed out that both Winston Churchill and Margaret Thatcher had had their intellect questioned but had proved their doubters wrong. And Mr Duncan Smith told the Evening Standard on Friday: "I never make any claims for myself, I just say I think we should all look at each other and be a little more pleasant." </body>

      <title>Cost of ministers' advisers up £1m</title>

      <body>The salary bill for ministers' special advisers has risen by £1m in the last year, according to official figures. So-called "Spads" are appointed by ministers to provide political advice over and above the impartial work carried out by civil servants. The Cabinet Office put the increase down to the "unusual" pressures caused by coalition government. But Labour said David Cameron's pre-election promise to limit the number of special advisers was in "tatters". A leap from 85 to 98 in the number of special advisers - who work directly to ministers and often speak for them - contributed to a 16% rise in the total wage bill in 2012-13. According to the Cabinet Office, the total salary bill was £7.2m last year, up from £6.2m in 2011-12 and more than the previous government spent in its final year. Special advisers played "an important role... advising ministers and contributing to the smooth running of government", a spokesman said. "This is particularly important in a coalition and the number of special advisers reflects the unusual circumstances of this government - the first coalition government for more than 60 years." He added that special advisers represented 2.2% of the senior civil service. But Labour MP Phil Wilson accused the prime minister of breaking his 2010 manifesto pledge to "put a limit on the number of special advisers". "While he tells the rest of the country to accept cuts, he's happy to spend more and more on his own spin doctors. It's more evidence of how out of touch he is that he thinks the rules don't apply to him," he added. </body>

      <body>Labour has questioned Parliament's relationship with a ticketing firm after it emerged the company had earned more than £350,000 in fees for selling tour tickets since the start of 2012. MP Luciana Berger said: "Taxpayers have a right to expect value for money. "The parliamentary authorities should look very closely at their ticketing arrangements and ensure they represent the best possible deal for the public." Visitors can book £16.50 advance tickets through Ticketmaster. It was revealed that Ticketmaster received £194,000 in fees last year, and £170,000 so far this year. Ms Berger said the fees paid to Ticketmaster represented a lot of money when there was huge pressure on public sector budgets. But spokesman for Parliament said the contract was decided by a competitive tender, won by Ticketmaster in 2009. He said: "The contract has recently gone out to tender again. Bids are in the process of being evaluated. The objective, as with all procurements, is to get the best deal." Parliament sold advance tickets worth almost £2m over the period. Members of the public can also arrange tours for free with their MP, or queue for tickets to the public gallery of the House of Commons. </body>

      <description>EU leaders meeting in Brussels say distrust of the US over spying could harm intelligence-gathering in the fight against terrorism.</description>

      <body>EU leaders meeting in Brussels said distrust of the US over spying could harm the fight against terrorism. A statement agreed by the leaders said that "a lack of trust could prejudice" intelligence-gathering co-operation. German spy chiefs are travelling to Washington next week to press for action over the alleged monitoring of Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone. Both Germany and France want talks with the US to find a new "understanding" by the end of the year. As well as the bugging of Mrs Merkel's phone, there are claims the US National Security Agency (NSA) has monitored millions of telephone calls by both German and French citizens. Spain on Friday followed Germany and France in summoning the US ambassador to explain reports of spying on the country. The UK's Guardian newspaper has reported that it obtained a confidential memo from the NSA suggesting it had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders. The latest revelations have been sourced to US whistleblower Edward Snowden, the former intelligence contractor who fled the country earlier this year and is now in Russia. US state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said a review of US intelligence gathering, called for by President Obama, would look at how it affects foreign policy. The "high level group of outside experts... will consider as part of this how we can maintain the public's trust, how the surveillance impacts our foreign policy, particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public," she said. The EU leaders' statement, released earlier on Friday, reflected their conclusions following talks on Thursday. It said the recent intelligence issues had raised "deep concerns" among European citizens. The statement said the leaders "underlined the close relationship between Europe and the USA and the value of that partnership". "[The leaders] stressed that intelligence-gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism," it continued. And it went on: "A lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field of intelligence-gathering." "The heads of state or government took note of the intention of France and Germany to seek bilateral talks with the USA with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field," the leaders' statement also said. "They noted that other EU countries are welcome to join this initiative." French President Francois Hollande said the aim of the initiative "is about knowing about the past and setting a framework for the future and putting an end to monitoring mechanisms that are not controlled". Germany and France said they are proposing talks with the US to settle the row by the end of the year. But Mrs Merkel stressed Berlin and Paris would be making their own separate approaches to Washington. BBC Europe editor Gavin Hewitt says the French and Germans are looking for a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. He says this would mirror an arrangement the United States has had with Britain, Australia, New Zealand and Canada since just after World War II. That secret intelligence-sharing operation is known as Five Eyes. Mrs Merkel said she did not know the exact details of the Five Eyes arrangement so could not say whether that is exactly what Germany is seeking, but added: "We need something clear-cut, in line with the spirit of an alliance". UK Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the UK's "unique partnership" with the US regarding security but said: "I understand what others want to do and support that, as I think does President Obama". When asked by the BBC if the US had ever monitored Mr Cameron's phone, White House National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said: "His communications have not, are not and will not be monitored by the US." 'Look to the future' The spying revelations have overshadowed other issues at the EU summit in Brussels, including the Mediterranean migration problem, which framed the agenda of Friday's talks. Italian authorities said they had intercepted some 800 migrants trying to cross the Mediterranean as the EU leaders prepared to meet. A number leaders indicated their support for the French and German position. Belgian Prime Minister Elio di Rupo said: "The objective must remain the same - to fight against terrorism but also respect privacy. "Everyone can understand the need for exceptional measures given the danger of terrorism... but we are not in the position where we should spy on each other." Swedish PM Fredrik Reinfeldt said it was "completely unacceptable" to eavesdrop on the leader of an ally, a view echoed by Italian PM Enrico Letta, who added: "We want the truth." Other leaders signalled the need to move on. Lithuanian President Dalia Grybauskaite said: "The main thing is that we look to the future. The trans-Atlantic partnership was, and is, important." Mrs Merkel had raised her concerns with US President Barack Obama in a call on Wednesday. White House spokesman Jay Carney later said Mr Obama had assured Mrs Merkel that her phone was not being listened to now and would not be in the future. However, his statement left open the question of whether calls had been listened to in the past. </body>

      <body>David Cameron has won the backing of EU chief Jose Manuel Barroso for his push to limit the number of new regulations coming out of Brussels. The two chaired a meeting of EU leaders on the issue at Friday's summit. The prime minister has said firms are being "throttled" by red tape and for every regulation and directive introduced another should be removed. Mr Barroso said more needed to be done to ensure "lighter, simpler, cheaper, common-sense regulation". The European Commission, the EU's executive arm, has said it has already cut 5,590 regulations since 2005. Mr Cameron is committed to renegotiating the UK's relationship with the EU if the Conservative Party wins the next election, ahead of an "in-out" referendum on whether the country should remain a member. In the meantime, he is promising to work to reduce the bureaucracy facing companies. Conservative sources say he wants to see 1,500 regulations reviewed. Eighty business leaders, including the chairmen of BT and Asda, have signed a letter calling for a "strong commitment" by the government towards this and several have accompanied Mr Cameron to Brussels to make the case. The prime minister has made the issue the central objective of the two-day European Council meeting. He held one-to-one meetings with the leaders of Germany and the Netherlands, who share similar views on deregulation, and co-chaired a meeting with the leaders of Poland, Finland, Sweden, the Netherlands, Italy and Estonia, who are also sympathetic. "The Commission has done an excellent job in lifting the burden of bureaucracy. Now I want to get business engaged," he said, adding that a faster pace of deregulation was essential to getting firms to "compete and succeed". Mr Barroso, the Commission's president, said he appreciated that businesses needed a single set of rules, rather than 28 different bodies of national regulation, for the single market to work and for the important digital economy to continue to grow. Acknowledging that "useless laws weaken necessary laws", he said there were other areas where it was necessary to cut bureaucracy without reducing standards of consumer protection, health and safety and environmental concerns. "That is why we have to slash red tape," he said. </body>

      <title>Serco chief executive stands down</title>
      <description>The boss of security firm Serco resigns after accusations of overcharging the government tens of millions of pounds for electronic tags for criminals.</description>

      <body>The chief executive at Serco, a security firm at the centre of an overcharging scandal, has resigned. Outgoing boss Chris Hyman said the best way for the company to move forward "is for me to step back". Serco is being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after claims it had overcharged the government by "tens of millions" of pounds for electronic tags for criminals. The government welcomed the news, describing it as a "positive move". In July, Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said an audit had revealed a "significant anomaly in the billing practices" of both Serco and rival G4S. Mr Grayling said that since 2005, the companies had in some cases been charging for tagging offenders who were in prison, had left the country or were even dead. In September, the government handed information to the SFO for their assessment. On Friday, Serco announced plans to reorganise the company. The firm said it would split the government work into a separate business that could be more closely monitored. For the moment, Mr Hyman's position will be taken over by Ed Casey, who runs the US division, while the company looks for an external full-time replacement. A government statement said it would "take full account of all the changes Serco have made today". "Whilst it is early days in their programme of renewal, this is a positive move by Serco and a step forward." The statement added that its review of government contracts, announced in July by the Justice Secretary, was continuing and would "ensure government's contractual arrangements are robust and taxpayers' money is spent responsibly, in a vibrant, competitive market for public services". Shadow justice secretary Sadiq Khan called for ministers to provide assurances that no confidentiality deals or "other arrangements that avoided justice" were being done. Mr Khan also asked ministers to "publish immediately the PriceWaterhouseCooper report into the activities of G4S and Serco." Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was "surprised" by the resignation of Mr Hyman, because he "always maintained there is nothing untoward with the contracts Serco holds with the government". He said Mr Hyman maintained the position "even after the company was referred by Secretary of State for Justice to the SFO". Shares in Serco, which has in excess of 120,000 staff in more than 30 countries, rose after the news. It has lost more than 10% of its value since May - when the government first voiced its concerns over the tagging contract. "They were always going to have to make some sort of major change," Cantor analyst Sam Thomas said. "This is about transforming their recently damaged reputation and I think in appointing an external new chief executive they are hoping to draw a line under the previous issues." Mr Hyman said he had "always put the interests of Serco first", adding that it was important the relationship with the government was rebuilt. He said: "I have been fortunate enough to have had the privilege of working at a great company with extremely talented people. I wish everyone at Serco the very best for the future." No new contracts are being awarded to either of the firms until the audit is completed, the government said in September. The UK chief executive at G4S, Richard Morris, also stepped down on Thursday. The latest development in the scandal is likely to fuel debate over the value to the government of outsourcing public services to private companies, after G4S failed to provide enough security staff for the 2012 Olympics. </body>

      <description>Campaigners write to David Cameron demanding action on the "national crisis" of cold homes, as people are advised to keep houses well heated.</description>

      <body>Fuel poverty campaigners have written to Prime Minister David Cameron demanding cross-party action on the "national crisis" of cold homes. Campaigners said the UK was second only to Estonia for people struggling to pay their energy bills across Europe. It came as Public Health England urged people to keep their homes well heated this winter to avoid potentially fatal health problems. It said living rooms should be 21C (70F) and other home areas 18C (65F). Campaign group Energy Bill Revolution - an alliance of charities including Age UK and Barnardos - said the biggest problem in the UK was "leaky homes" and called for investment in a domestic insulation programme. Energy Bill Revolution said "woeful" levels of insulation had left Britain falling way behind comparable European countries such as Sweden, Germany and the Netherlands. Campaign director Ed Matthew said: "Our political leaders are falling over themselves to come up with headline-grabbing ways to cut energy bills yet they fall woefully short of a true solution to the energy bill crisis. "By far the biggest opportunity to cut energy bills is to fully insulate the UK's leaky homes. No other investment can do so much for so many. If the government is serious about solving this crisis they must make insulating homes the UK's number one infrastructure priority." Public Health England's advice came in its Cold Weather Plan for 2013, after four of the big six energy companies announced price rises. Age UK said older people in particular were increasingly anxious about the cost of heating their homes. Winter health risks range from flu to falls - but the cold can also make heart and respiratory problems much worse. On average there are about 24,000 excess winter deaths in England each year, many of which experts say are preventable. The plan has been produced in collaboration with the Department of Health, NHS England and the Local Government Association. It contains advice for the NHS and local government, as well as individuals. This includes having your flu vaccination if you are in an at-risk group, ensuring homes are properly insulated and making sure heating systems are routinely checked. From November, the Met Office will issue cold weather alerts if the temperature dips to 2C (35F) or less, or if there is severe winter weather such as heavy snow or widespread ice. Dr Paul Cosford, director for health protection and medical director at Public Health England, said: "In colder weather, keeping yourself warm is essential to staying healthy, especially for the very young, older people or those with a chronic condition such as heart disease and asthma." Public health minister Jane Ellison said: "The elderly and those with long-term illnesses are particularly at risk during winter months so it's crucial that people stay warm." Age UK's charity director Caroline Abrahams said: "Being cold is a huge health risk for older people so it is absolutely essential that older people stay warm during the winter months. "But with fuel poverty blighting the lives of millions of households in the UK many older people are feeling increasingly anxious about the rising cost of energy. "The government must show it has a clear long-term plan to make low income homes more energy efficient." Labour's shadow energy and climate change minister, Jonathan Reynolds, said: "People are being left in real hardship because David Cameron won't stand up to the energy companies. "Britain's energy is market is not working for families and business." </body>

      <body>Labour has won the Scottish Parliament by-election in Dunfermline, after beating the SNP by almost 3,000 votes. The victory represented a gain from the SNP, who took the seat in the 2011 Holyrood election. The by-election was caused by the resignation of sitting MSP Bill Walker, who was thrown out of the SNP and jailed for domestic abuse. Cara Hilton, the parliament's newest MSP, said the people of Dunfermline "deserved better". The SNP won Dunfermline as part of its landslide election win in 2011 with a majority of just 590 votes, but was not able to hold on. In the end, Labour took the seat with a majority of 2,873 - a 7% swing from the SNP. The Liberal Democrats came third in the contest, with the Conservatives in fourth place. Ms Hilton said: "After the disgrace of Bill Walker, Dunfermline deserves better and I will ensure that we will be better - far better than what went before." And ahead of the SNP administration's independence referendum next year, she added: "We need a Scottish government that will address the needs of Scots, not one that will simply make promises about what will happen after 2016. "Today Dunfermline has sent a message to Bute House and Alex Salmond: it's time for you to focus on the real priorities of Scots, not your constitutional obsession." The by-election campaign centred on contentious local issues, including proposed school closures, while the SNP focused on its national policies such as the council tax freeze and the decision to remove the tolls on the nearby Forth Road Bridge. Despite the result, SNP candidate Shirley-Anne Somerville said she was proud of the campaign she fought. "We've run a positive campaign trying to support local parents in their schools and I hope we can come together, all of us in the party, to make sure those three schools in the Dunfermline constituency stay open," she said. The Liberal Democrats saw their vote drop by 8% on the night. Candidate Susan Leslie said: "I think it has been a victory for women in politics in Scotland that four women stood in this by-election and fought positive campaigns on the issues for Dunfermline." Scottish Conservative candidate James Reekie - whose party saw a 1% increase in its vote - added: "When the people of Dunfermline are faced with the dilemma of Labour and the SNP, they chose the Conservatives." Turnout in the by-election was 42.65%. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail sale gets under way</title>
      <description>Re-privatising the East Coast Main line will "revitalise" it, ministers say as they kick-start the franchising process, but Labour and unions attack the move.</description>

      <body>Returning the East Coast Main line to the private sector will "revitalise" it, ministers have said as they kick-started the franchising process. The line has been publicly run since 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise amid financial problems. Ministers say the line has since been "stabilised" but they now want to "rekindle the spirit of competition". Labour and the unions say the move is "ideological" and the line should remain in public ownership. They say the failure of two successive operators to make the line - which runs from London to Edinburgh, with connected services to Inverness and Aberdeen - commercially viable and its improved performance in recent years show it can succeed under public ownership. The government began the franchising process on Friday by releasing information about the line's financial position as well as the basic criteria for interested parties and details of the commercial risks involved. The successful bidder is due to be announced in a year's time. The franchise is due to start in February 2015 and is expected to run for a maximum of 11 years. Among those reported to be interested in bidding is Eurostar, which runs services from London to the Continent. Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said public ownership was never meant to be a permanent arrangement and returning the operation of the line to the private sector would bring more investment and innovation. "We want to see a revitalised East Coast railway, one that both rekindles the spirit of competition for customers on this great route and competes with the West Coast on speed, quality and customer service," he said. Since 2009, the line has been run by Directly Operated Railways, an arms-length company overseen by the Department for Transport. Figures in Friday's document suggest total journeys on the line have increased by a million to 19.1 million under public ownership while revenue has risen by 11% to £692m. In the year to October 2013, 89% of East Coast trains arrived at their final destination within 10 minutes of their advertised time, compared to a national average of 92%. Rail minister Stephen Hammond told the BBC the firm had done a "good job" but the East Coast "lagged behind" other long-distance operators in terms of punctuality while customer satisfaction was only "in line" with other routes. "There is a lot more that can be done," he said, adding that the doubling of rail passengers since privatisation in the 1990s showed the benefits of the franchise process. Critics of privatisation say the East Coast line has returned nearly £800m to the taxpayer under public ownership. But Mr Hammond said this was not a fair comparison as Network Rail had reduced charges for using the track substantially since National Express relinquished the franchise. The government says it is already planning "significant" investment in the line over the next six years, including new rolling stock, upgrades to the track around Peterborough and the rebuilding of Doncaster station. But it wants a private sector operator to "transform the customer experience", develop "innovative timetables" and identify further opportunities for improving stations along the 393-mile London to Edinburgh route. But Labour said the privatisation process - which was expected to be delayed until after the next election - was being driven by ideological reasons rather than the interests of passengers. The opposition say the government has "learnt nothing" from the debacle over the West Coast Main Line franchising process last year, which had to be abandoned after mistakes by civil servants led to flawed calculations. "We think it should be allowed to get on and act as a public sector comparator for the other rail franchises," shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh told the BBC News Channel. Asked why Labour had changed its policy since 2009, when it said public ownership was temporary, she argued the facts had changed. "We have been very surprised and happy with the directly operated railway...We think, at the very least, it should be able to bid for this franchise." The RMT union has pledged to fight the re-privatisation, saying the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership in order to "bulldoze" the sale through. Earlier this month it claimed a leaked version of the draft sale brochure redacted sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. "It is simply outrageous that the government are firing the starting gun on the re-privatisation of the East Coast when every objective analysis shows that this is a successful and reliable service," RMT boss Bob Crow said. And the TUC said the line needed an operator which would put passengers not shareholders first. "The government doesn't have one good argument for re-privatising the line and is yet again being blinded by outdated market dogma," said general secretary Frances O'Grady. But the Rail Delivery Group, which speaks on behalf of commercial train operators and Network Rail, said the rail network had been transformed under such a public-private business model. "This partnership is a winning formula that is delivering for passengers, businesses and the taxpayer," said the group's director general Michael Roberts. Consumer watchdog Passenger Focus said it would be scrutinising the tendering process very carefully. "It has never been more important that companies are publicly held to account for their passenger satisfaction ratings - these must be built into the very heart of the contract," said its chief executive Anthony Smith. "However, it is good to see the franchise process moving ahead again and unlocking much-needed investment." </body>

      <title>MEPs vote to suspend US data sharing</title>
      <description>A non-binding vote in the EU represents growing unease about the amount of data Europe has shared with the US.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>Salmond 'certain' on Ineos deal</title>
      <description>First Minister Alex Salmond says he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved.</description>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has said he is "absolutely certain" that the petrochemical plant at Grangemouth can be saved. Staff are waiting to hear if owner Ineos will grant a reprieve to the closure-threatened operation. About 800 jobs are under threat - and the company has already laid off about 2,000 contractors since it shut down the complex. Ineos will update the staff on its plans at a meeting at 11:00. Speaking on the BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I would now be very hopeful indeed that there will be a change in position from Ineos and I'm absolutely certain there's a future for chemicals in Grangemouth. "I believe there will be a change in position today and that will be a favourable change in position. "My reason for saying that is that everybody has been going that extra mile I called for. "Given that only 48 hours ago we were looking at a major industrial catastrophe in Scotland, I think we're in a much better position this Friday morning." Mr Salmond said the trade unions had offered that there would be no industrial action for three years. "That's an indication that however we got to this impasse two days ago, there has now been substantial movement of people anxious to save their jobs, their livelihoods and their plants," he told the programme. Political leaders had already expressed optimism after the union accepted a survival plan put forward by Ineos. The BBC understands that an agreement was being drawn up for workers to sign, which would need approval from major Ineos shareholder Jim Ratcliffe. On Thursday, Scotland's finance secretary John Swinney and the Scottish Secretary Alastair Carmichael held talks with unions and management at the site. Afterwards they said they were hopeful. However, Ineos is yet to confirm whether it will reverse its decision to close the petrochemical plant at the complex. An internal investigation by Ineos into the union convenor, Stephen Deans, is also due to be published later. It was the firm's treatment of Mr Deans that first ignited the breakdown in industrial relations - before it became a battle for the survival of Scotland's largest industrial site. The dispute at the site escalated to the threat of strike action. This was dropped but Ineos shut down the plant and issued an offer of revised terms and conditions in a survival plan, which was initially rejected by union members. The proposals included ending their final salary pension scheme and cut shift allowances. Previously, Ineos said it was ready to invest £300m in Grangemouth if workers agreed to the new terms and conditions. The company said it had decided to close the plant because half the workforce had refused to accept the cost-cutting plan essential for the facility's survival. Ineos chairman and founder Jim Ratcliffe had said at the weekend that if the petrochemical plant closed it was likely the neighbouring refinery would go as well. The refinery provides most of the fuel to Scotland, the north of England and Northern Ireland. Ineos had said liquidators for the petrochemical plant would be appointed within a week. </body>

      <description>Five Respect councillors in Bradford fully resign from the party, accusing George Galloway of defamation and lack of transparency.</description>

      <body>The Respect party no longer has any councillors in Bradford after they all resigned, accusing George Galloway of defamation and lack of transparency. The five councillors, elected in a surge of local support for Respect last year, temporarily resigned in August but have now left the party altogether. Two were suspended over criticism of Mr Galloway's plans to stand for London mayor, and he questioned their loyalty. Respect said the councillors' conduct had been "unacceptable". The five councillors are Alyas Karmani, Ruqaya Collector, Faisal Khan, Ishtiaq Ahmed and Mohammed Shabbir. Speaking to The Guardian in August, they criticised Mr Galloway, saying he should step down as an MP if he wanted to fight in the 2016 London mayoral election. In response to the article, Mr Galloway accused the councillors of "destabilising the party" and "conniving with the Khans", in reference to his former aide Aisha Ali Khan and her police officer husband Det Insp Afiz Khan who have been charged with misconduct offences. Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabbir were suspended by national party managers the same day. In a statement issued on Friday the councillors said they had been in discussions with senior party officials over the past two months to address their concerns about the "unwarranted" suspensions, "defamatory" statements made about them and a "failure to develop transparent operations structures and procedures to enable the party to work effectively in Bradford". They said: "Regrettably, these discussions have failed to find common ground as senior Respect officials have shown a disregard to address our legitimate grievances and we have been unable to resolve our issues of difference. "After much deliberation this has left our group no choice but to fully resign from the Respect party with immediate effect." The councillors said they would continue as independents for the remainder of their terms. Respect said talks between party officials and the councillors had "foundered on the unacceptable conduct of the councillors", who it accused of regularly speaking out against the party. It said Mr Ahmed and Mr Shabir were expelled by the party on Thursday, the day the councillors say they informed officials of their resignation. A Respect statement said the councillors' visibility and impact in the council chamber "has been virtually non-existent". "If they had a shred of principle they would now resign their council seats and stand again in their new colours. Or will they instead continue to draw thousands of pounds of public money until they are removed by the voters?" </body>

      <body>The Northern Ireland Executive has been challenged to reform how it delivers key infrastructure projects such as roads and energy links as a matter of urgency. CBI Northern Ireland said it was "incredibly frustrated at the lack of an appropriate pipeline of works" that would attract investment and new jobs. It has published a new report, calling for several projects to be prioritised. The projects include a second north-south electricity inter-connector. CBI Northern Ireland believes a new Stormont agency should be created and charged with the procurement and delivery of major projects. The agency would report directly to the finance minister. Other schemes the CBI wants action on are strategic roads like the York Street interchange in Belfast and the A6 road to Londonderry. CBI vice-chair Adrian Eakin said: "Relatively simple steps can make our system more fit for purpose and project a view to investors that Northern Ireland is a place which puts delivery of infrastructure top of its agenda. "Northern Ireland cannot afford to be behind the curve." The organisation said the Northern Ireland Executive should explore all avenues of funding such as the European Investment Bank. Its ideas are contained in its new report called Infrastructure - Investing for our Future. </body>

      <title>Sharp rise in council's rent arrears</title>
      <description>North Lanarkshire Council claims more than 2,000 of its tenants are in rent arrears for the first time after housing benefit changes.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-24662376</url>
      <date>1382706036</date>

      <body>More than 2,000 people in one part of Scotland have got into rent arrears for the first time since changes to housing benefit were made in the spring. North Lanarkshire Council thinks it is owed £675,000 from tenants because of the spare room subsidy - dubbed the bedroom tax, by critics. The council is the largest local authority landlord in Scotland. It also believes many people who could be eligible for help to deal with their benefit cut have not applied for it. This is the most detailed assessment so far of the impact of the changes on one council area in Scotland. More than 5,000 council tenants in North Lanarkshire lost some of their housing benefit in April because they were deemed to have spare bedrooms. An analysis produced by the council - covering the six months up to September - said 2,333 tenants who previously had no rent arrears owed the authority money by September. A further 1,100 already had rent arrears before the changes took place. This meant that 3,449 of the 5,201 people who lost some of their housing benefit in North Lanarkshire had rent arrears. Overall, rent arrears over the past six months were up by two thirds compared to the same period last year though the council was stressing the changes to housing benefit were only one reason for this. Tenants now owe the council more than £2.5m in total. The council said about £675,000 of these arrears could be the result of the benefit changes. However, the council also believes that some people who could have been helped by the special discretionary housing payments, available to those affected by the benefit changes, may not have applied for them. This means that some of the arrears may have been avoidable - or that there could have been help for people who have struggled to make up for the loss of benefit. North Lanarkshire said it would not evict tenants solely because of spare room subsidy arrears during this financial year as long as they had contacted the housing service for assistance and advice. A spokesman said: "Clearly the UK government's welfare reforms are already having a significant effect on our tenants. "The council has set aside funds to assist vulnerable people in every way possible but it is essential that tenants who are worried or in difficulty talk to us. "We have hired additional trained advisers who can discuss each case and provide help with applications for financial assistance. We have already helped thousands of people, so anyone who needs that assistance should contact their local housing office." Council leader Jim McCabe condemned the UK government's changes to housing benefit but urged people who have been affected to speak to the council to see if help could be provided. The council has nearly £1.2m available to hand out in these payments - £470,000 of it is from the UK government, the rest is from the council's own budget. So far it has paid out £350,000 in these payments to nearly 2,900 people. Separate figures from the council give some indication of the scale of the arrears that individuals are building up. As of last week, about 460 people have arrears equivalent to the cut in their benefit while 500 have built up new arrears since April of an even greater amount. The other tenants with arrears appear to have tried to make up some of the shortfall or have received help. The Scottish Conservatives' welfare spokesman Alex Johnstone MSP said the figures showed that the issue of welfare reform was not as black and white as the Scottish government, and what he called the "left-wing establishment", would like to make out. Mr Johnstone said: "Welfare reform is a challenge that must be addressed so that it is fair to those who receive, and fair on those who pay for it. "The ever-growing cost of the welfare budget is something which successive governments have failed to address. "But the 'ignore the problem and it might go away' approach simply hasn't worked and has only resulted in fostering a culture of people being left to languish on benefits for years." A spokesperson for the UK Department for Work and Pensions said: "Scotland has been given £10m this year to help vulnerable people and we are monitoring this spending carefully to ensure that tenants get the support they need during welfare reforms. "It is important to remember that housing benefit will still cover the vast majority of people's rent, but the taxpayer can no longer afford to pay for spare bedrooms. "People have a number of options available to them, including moving to another property in the public or private sector, or making up the difference in rent through going into work or working more hours." Scottish Housing Minister Margaret Burgess said: "We know that 80% of households affected by the bedroom tax contain an adult with a recognised disability, and over 15,000 children are affected. "That's why have consistently expressed our opposition to this measure. "The Scottish government is doing all it can to help the people hit by the bedroom tax, with £20m of funding available this year and a further £20m available next year." </body>

      <body>A Welsh government minister has been criticised for giving "evasive" answers to an assembly committee. The assembly's environment committee said Natural Resources Minister Alun Davies gave them contradictory information about his portfolio. Members condemned his department for financial management and planning failures, including "basic errors" in its draft budget. The Welsh government said issues raised were "flawed and inaccurate". In a letter to the Finance Committee about the Natural Resources department's budget, the AMs said: "We are disappointed with the timeliness of information provided by the minister, and the oral evidence session, where a number of questions were evaded or contradictory information provided. "We believe that this is an indicator of problems at the heart of financial management and planning of this department and we will continue to keep a very close eye on these issues both in-year and at future budget rounds. "We believe the department's approach to financial management hinders general transparency. We are therefore unable to assess whether the budget is appropriately prioritised and is providing value for money." Mr Davies was criticised after £342m of farm subsidy payments were left out of the government's supplementary budget earlier this year due to what he called an "administrative error". Committee members said that while the minister said there would be no impact on farmers, "there is a discrepancy between officials and the minister about whether or not this shortfall will need to be covered from other areas within the Welsh Government budget". The Liberal Democrat environment spokesman, William Powell, said that Mr Davies' performance before the Environment Committee was "embarrassing" and showed a "lack of competence". "The Minister's budget included a number of basic errors, such as referring to schemes and policy areas that have ceased to exist," said Mr Powell. The Welsh government responded strongly to the critical letter. A spokesperson said: "The majority of the issues raised are simply flawed and inaccurate and we do not accept them. "The content and tone of the letter are also wholly misleading. "The Minister for Natural Resources and Food will be writing to the Chair of the Environment Committee shortly to address the issues raised." </body>

      <title>Heseltine plea on 'decaying' towns</title>
      <description>A magazine article which suggested that government money should no longer be spent on some deprived English towns and cities is criticised by former cabinet minister Lord Heseltine.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24630952</url>

      <body>The former deputy prime minister Lord Heseltine has dismissed claims that "failing" towns and cities should be abandoned by the government. An article in The Economist suggested that a number of industrial towns were "decaying" and their inhabitants should be encouraged to find jobs elsewhere. The magazine listed Hull, Burnley, Middlesbrough and Hartlepool as places where "dollops of public money" had failed to boost the local economy, despite years of heroic effort. The article has caused an outcry in Hull, where the city council leader described its recommendations as "disgusting". In an interview for the Sunday Politics in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Lord Heseltine said similar claims were made about Liverpool in the 1980s. Michael Heseltine was appointed by Margaret Thatcher to lead the regeneration of Liverpool, following riots in the city in 1981. The former Conservative cabinet minister claims the best way to stimulate economic growth in deprived towns and cities is to devolve more power away from Whitehall. Lord Heseltine said: "What I have argued over decades is that we should say to cities what would you do? "Because you know what Leeds needs, what Bradford needs and what Hull needs." Former Liverpool MP Peter Kilfoyle told me there had been numerous calls over the years to turn-off the government spending taps on Merseyside. Mr Kilfoyle, who served as a Labour minister under Tony Blair, said: "We had a think-tank a few years ago which said that Liverpool should be abandoned and everybody should move to the south. "This is nonsense. Any forward looking government would want to invest in Hull, just as they invested in Liverpool." Cabinet papers from 1981 reveal the chancellor of the exchequer at the time - Sir Geoffrey Howe - raised the possibility of a programme of "managed decline" in Liverpool. However, Lord Howe recently said there was never a suggestion that Liverpool should be abandoned by the Conservative government in the 1980s. </body>

      <description>As Labour-run local authorities warn over new cuts, Eric Pickles accuses them of "shroud waving".</description>

      <body>The battle lines are being drawn. Within the next few months, our large local authorities will outline where the spending axe will fall on local services. It's become an annual fixture in the political calendar. By the end of this parliament, councils will have seen their budgets squeezed by one third, with the prospect of further cuts after the next general election. But in the East Midlands, there are two new players. Both Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire are now Labour controlled; and since the party's victory in May's local elections, hardly a day has passed without a dire warning of the tough choices having to be taken by the new leadership to balance the books. The Communities Secretary Eric Pickles this week got his retaliation in first. He told MPs that complaining Labour authorities were more interested in "shroud-waving" and cutting front-line services. He's also been brushing down his "50 Ways to Save", his guide to councils to make the most of their budgets. It'll be no surprise that the leader of Derbyshire county council, Labour's Anne Western, takes a very different view of the financial challenges facing her authority in the next budget round. "You can either shrink and shrink your services until there's nothing left, or we can reinvent what we do," she told me. "In the six months since we took control, we've been talking to partners like the NHS. Our priority is what the people of Derbyshire want." That may be music to the ears of the Communities Secretary. He's been encouraging councils to reach out to other organisations to share costs. "To be frank, this is the future," he said. "It makes sense to work together on procurement, joint use of offices and shared services." One key area for Anne Western is the provision of council-run residential care services for the elderly. Derbyshire has 26 such care homes and spends £72m annually on care services, one of the highest of any shire county. Many of its neighbouring authorities have already sold-off or part-privatised the service. Anne Western said: "People get a huge sense of confidence when the service is council-run because of the quality of the staff and the training. It's also more accountable." Only a few weeks ago, the prime minister dismissed warnings from Anne Western over the consequences of budget cuts on services and jobs in Derbyshire. He described additional council cuts following the chancellor's budget as "relatively modest". "He's just playing with numbers," replied Anne Western. "It's not just me as a Labour leader. There are Conservative leaders up and down the country arguing the case for a rethink on budgets." Rethink? From the Communities Secretary? That may look unlikely. What's more likely is Eric Pickles quoting from a recent BBC/ ICM survey . It indicated that many people believe local council services - rubbish collection, libraries and schools - have actually improved in the past few years. In the months ahead, watch out for those battle lines being drawn. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>The 2014 European elections look set to see more anti-EU MEPs elected to the parliament in Brussels, bringing more allies to UKIP as it speaks of beating all three of Britain's longer-established parties. It is not clear how well the eurosceptics will get along - UKIP has said it will not work with the far right parties from France and the Netherlands - and not all of them want their country to leave the EU. Pro-European parties fear the eurosceptics may try to clog up the institution. Giles Dilnot reports from Strasbourg.

      <body>France and Germany have announced they are to seek new rules for intelligence co-operation with the United States following their dispute with Washington over spying. The move follows revelations that US intelligence agencies may have been monitoring the mobile phone of the German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, and millions of French phone calls. The former security minister, Lord West, told the Today programme while the events are embarrassing they come as no surprise: "Clearly it's extremely embarrassing when something is written down on paper which shows, does seem to show that they were trying to collect information on the phones of those particular people." "I've always worked on the assumption... that people were listening to my phone calls and trying to get information from me; and I know they jolly well were," he said. "It's a reality of the nasty world we live in," he added. First broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Friday 25 October 2013. </body>

      <title>How do leaders cope with bugging?</title>
      <description>Why world leaders don't like using secure phones</description>

      <body>The most common reaction to news that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone was bugged by the US National Security Agency appears to be world-weary resignation. Followed by a sly suggestion that someone of her experience and stature should have known better. Kurt Volker, former US ambassador to Nato 2008-2009, told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme "every country spies" and he could not believe that the revelations were a surprise to anyone. Lord West, a security minister under Gordon Brown, said he had "always worked on the assumption" that people were listening to his phone calls. "I know they jolly well were," he told Today. "I don't think it's surprising that people try and listen. If you are a head of state there are lots of people, not just other states, who are listening. "There are companies, all sorts of people, who want to hear what you are saying and I think you have to be extremely careful." A former senior British diplomat, who did not want to be named, told the BBC News website he always worked on the assumption that his phone calls were being listened to. This could sometimes be turned to the British delegation's advantage, he explained, by reinforcing the message that they were trying to get across in negotiations in supposedly private phone conversations, knowing full well that they would be intercepted. But at the same time, it was worth remembering when reading reports of what the representatives of other nations were saying that they were probably up to the same game, he added. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett recently revealed that Nicolas Sarkozy, the then French interior minister, tried to save time in negotiations over the closure of the Sangatte transit camp by saying he already knew the British position because the French secret service had intercepted unencrypted Home Office emails. But not everyone is quite so sanguine. Clare Short, who made headlines and provoked fury in Downing Street in 2004 when she revealed that the British secret service had bugged the office and telephone of then UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, says she was genuinely "shocked" by the Merkel revelations. The former international development secretary also rejects the argument that Mrs Merkel's anger is for the benefit of the German public, many of whom are still haunted by the memory of the Stasi. "I am sure she was very angry and upset. These were her friends and now [she finds] they don't trust her," says Ms Short. Ms Short said she was regularly given intelligence reports about what Mr Annan was saying in the supposed privacy of his office but she became increasingly uncomfortable about this in the run-up to the Iraq war. She recalls the surreal and disturbing experience of chatting to Kofi Annan on her mobile phone and realising that someone would probably be listening in and transcribing every word. She says she can not recall any examples of being handed intelligence reports about what friendly powers were saying to each other on the phone during her time in office, from 1997 to 2003. But she says she was approached by "successive Cs" - the code name for the head of MI6 - offering to spy on the leaders of friendly nations in Africa. "I told them, 'No of course not. We don't want to spy on the people we are working with,'" she tells the BBC News website. She also explodes one popular myth about notorious technophobe Tony Blair - that he did not carry a mobile phone during his years in power. "I don't really believe that," she says, adding that it might be part of Downing Street myth-making: "It makes him more emperor-like." All heads of state, in the Western world at least, will have access to encrypted mobile phones and other secure lines. The problem, for security staff, is convincing world leaders to take the espionage threat seriously. Shortly after taking office in 2008, Barack Obama managed to convince the secret service to let him keep his own Blackberry, despite fears it would broadcast his location and make him vulnerable to hacking. Mr Obama is said to be frustrated about having to live in the White House "bubble", cut off from the outside world and unable to communicate with normal people. The President's Blackberry is often seen on his belt and he is sometimes pictured scrolling through his messages as he travels in his limousine. In France, senior officials have access to a secure intranet and phone network - but the country's leaders are reported to be reluctant to use the slow and restrictive system, which can take up to 30 seconds to place a call. President Francois Hollande is said to have followed predecessor Nicolas Sarkozy by holding on to his personal smartphone. Mobile phones are banned in No 10 - you have to hand them in at the door - over fears foreign powers are listening in. All calls in and out are routed through a secure switchboard staffed by officials - a system which continues when the prime minister is travelling. Downing Street is remaining tight-lipped about the latest bugging revelations. Asked earlier if the prime minister was still using his mobile phone, Mr Cameron's official spokesman said: "I haven't seen him use a different one". </body>

      <title>Red tape, not red lines</title>
      <description>A different focus for David Cameron at the EU summit?</description>

      <body>Time and again British leaders would come to Brussels pledging to defend their "red lines" in negotiations. As these had often been thrashed out in advance behind the scenes, they could go home with "victory" secured. This time it isn't red lines, but red tape. David Cameron is coming to the EU summit threatening to "hold Brussels' feet to the fire". For the prime minister, that fire would preferably be a bonfire of regulations. He will be flanked by two members of his business task force - Marc Bolland of MandS, and Dale Murray, an investor in new enterprises - and their message will be that growth is being held back across the continent because of the burdens placed on wealth-creating companies. But the European Commission is wondering what all the fuss is about. Its centre-right President Jose Manuel Barroso says he has cut 5,000 regulations in recent years. He would take personal credit for stopping new health and safety restrictions on hairdressers which could have stopped them wearing high heels at work. And he's grounded a directive on soil that had been discussed for the past eight years. The Commission says that the debate on deregulation shouldn't take up too much time at the summit, but David Cameron will be spending quite a bit of his time in Brussels talking about it. This includes a meeting on the margins with Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, and the leaders of some other northern European countries who want to see further cuts in regulation - and new rules headed off. But David Cameron has made great play of not just reducing the burden of regulation, but suggesting that there are some areas where Brussels shouldn't be regulating at all. To the delight and relief of many of his backbenchers who have been viewing UKIP's rise with trepidation, he promised to renegotiate Britain's relationship with Brussels ahead of the referendum he'll hold on EU membership if he is still prime minister in 2017. But the Commission says that, while he has talked to them about EU-wide regulations, he has barely uttered a word on the repatriation of powers. There has been a discussion on what justice measures UK ministers will opt in to, having said they would exercise the blanket opt-out bequeathed to them by Tony Blair. But beyond that, nothing. No mention of the economic and social measures that it had been assumed that Britain wanted back - for example on working hours. Now, Downing Street has a rather straightforward response. The means of renegotiating would come through any further attempts to alter EU treaties. For example if Mrs Merkel wanted a new treaty to incorporate the recent inter-governmental arrangements on the eurozone, Britain would seize the opportunity to ask for something in return for their agreement. But with a new German coalition not yet in place, treaty change hasn't been on the agenda. Privately some Conservatives suspect that the difficulty of renegotiating - and getting the agreement of 27 other countries - might be concentrating the prime minister's mind. Therefore, if he can argue that he has taken the lead in changing Brussels for the better - and that they have joined with him in making the EU more business friendly, then there is perhaps less need to grab back some powers. He could then go in to the referendum, if it is held, arguing that EU is a very different beast from the one he was dealing with at the time of his Europe speech, thanks to the alliance he has built with northern European nations and centre-right governments. Downing Street insists there has been no shift in position. </body>

      <description>What is the point of government consultations?</description>

      <body>What is the point of government consultations? I pose the question at the end of a week in which ministers responded to three official consultations on three controversial proposals - and appeared to ignore the results from them all. On Monday, the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) published its response to a consultation on planned changes to the assessment of people with disabilities in determining their entitlement to benefits. The government had conducted the consultation, it said, "in a fully open-minded manner". Ministers had carefully considered all the views expressed. The consultation focused on plans limiting entitlement to extra help for mobility needs to those who cannot walk 20m. The overwhelming response was that this was a bad idea. "Respondents felt there was no evidence to support the use of 20m," the consultation reported, pointing out "that other government policies use 50m as a measure of mobility". In a section entitled "What you told us", the DWP notes concern that the plan "could increase isolation and reduce independence, have significant financial impact, and cause deterioration in their physical and mental health". Respondents warned that the 20m criteria would mean some disabled people needing support from other public services, increasing the cost for the government. "The most common suggestion made by respondents", the DWP reports, "was to extend the qualifying distance for the enhanced rate from 20m to a longer distance". Nowhere in the government's response to the consultation is there evidence that anyone thought the 20m criteria was the right policy. "Having considered all these factors", the DWP response concludes, "the government believes that the use of 20m is the best way of identifying those whose physical mobility is most limited". It is, of course, the democratic right of ministers to consult and to listen and then ignore. The arguments put forward by the DWP may be compelling. But it does lead some to ask whether the consultation really had much value. A similar question might be posed following the government's response on Tuesday to consultations on two proposals concerning immigrants. The Home Office published the results of the public consultation on plans for a levy on temporary non-EEA migrants as a contribution towards the costs of possible NHS care while in the UK. It is a move that ministers claim enjoys considerable public support, but the consultation came back with a rather different view. On the principle of a levy, "34% felt that temporary migrants should make a direct contribution to the costs of their healthcare. Sixty-two per cent disagreed," it found. The Home Office notes differences depending upon the "type of respondent". Among the general public, 65% were against the plan. Among organisations that responded, 77% were opposed. Health-sector respondents, however, were in favour - 66% felt temporary migrants should contribute to the cost of their healthcare. It is the view of 235 health sector respondents, representing around 12% of the total, that appears to have swayed ministers most. "We have considered all responses to these questions carefully but remain convinced that only permanent migrants should be automatically eligible for free NHS care." Consultations are not referendums. In a way, it seems odd the Home Office should go to such trouble to quantify the proportions for and against the policy since the exercise is not designed as an X-factor style public vote. But having conducted a public consultation and expressing gratitude to all those "who have taken the time to respond and to those who have contributed their experience and insight to what is a complex issue", one is left wondering what the point was. The government response to a separate consultation, also published on Tuesday, invites the same question. This time the proposal under scrutiny was the introduction of a legal obligation on landlords to check the immigration status of tenants. "While between one-third and two-fifths of respondents supported the proposal," the Home Office response states, "slightly more than half of all respondents disagreed." The Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors considered it "inappropriate to use private landlords and lettings agents to help deliver the government's immigration policy". The majority of landlord representative organisations were opposed. "The most widely expressed concern by third sector organisations," the Home Office reveals, "was the potential to impact on vulnerable people, such as those who were homeless, those with learning difficulties and those fleeing domestic abuse". The response? "The government has carefully considered the responses to the consultation and remains convinced of an urgent need for action to deter illegal migration and to safeguard the legitimate housing market." The consultation may lead to ministers including an amendment designed to counter discrimination against foreign national tenants. But on the broad proposal, it seems the exercise has not shifted government thinking one jot. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), "public consultation is one of the key regulatory tools employed to improve transparency, efficiency and effectiveness of regulation". But there has long been scepticism as to whether such exercises are anything more than cosmetic. The public consultation is an opportunity for ministers to test their ideas with experts, those directly affected and voters more generally. Community participation on proposed legislation is seen as a key component of "citizen power". But formal public consultation exercises very rarely result in a government re-think - even if they reveal profound concern. That is not the point of them, and we should not pretend otherwise. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Green taxes</title>
      <description>What are they and how do they affect our bills?</description>

      <body>The past few months have been dominated by a debate over energy prices, with all the political parties coming up with ideas to try to bring them down. The prime minister has announced a review into how the government's climate change policies - so-called green levies or taxes - affect bills and whether they are delivering value for money. But what exactly are these green taxes and how do they affect our bills? UK household dual fuel - electricity and gas - energy bills in 2013 are estimated to be about £1,267, based on average levels of energy consumption. What is that made up of? The chart below shows what the Department of Energy and Climate Change says makes up (in % terms) the average household energy bill. So green energy measures make up 9% of that cost, or £112. The average price of gas and electricity paid by UK households has risen by about 18% and 9% in real terms since 2010 and by about 41% and 20% in real terms since 2007. The chart below shows all of the climate change policies that in some way increase energy bills. So people talk about green levies, but there are in fact lots of different things introduced over the past decade and a half. Some cost people money, some save people money and some do both for different groups of people. It wouldn't therefore be easy to repeal all of them at all (many, like the Green Deal are halfway through their operation and would presumably cost more to get rid of it in the short term than it would to keep longer term). Well, the government says that by 2020 the cumulative impact of their measures will save the average household some 11%. The graph below shows all of the policies and how much they will add or take away from a household bill. So with all those things taken together the Department for Energy and Climate Change say that this is what their effect will be on household bills: So far so good, the policies are saving households' money. But if we look at the effect the policy has on retail prices (rather than bills) - how much each household pays for every unit of energy it consumes - we have a very different picture. Impact of levies on Retail Prices (% change from baseline) On that picture households will be paying 41% more for their electricity bills as a result of green policies than the retail price is expected to be. How is that circle squared? Well, it comes down to government's projections that: So although the retail price will be higher as a result of green measures we'll also use less energy thanks to them. Moreover even if we take the initial figure of 11%, nearly half of that actually comes from changes to boiler regulations all the way back in 2002. If those are removed, then the other measures in place save much less - only about 6%. So if the government has got it sums wrong on how much energy insulation will save, householders could find themselves with a rather big headache in the years to come. The impact of green measures is more considerable on business than for householders. Businesses that are medium-sized users of energy currently face energy (gas plus electricity) costs that are on average between 15% and 21% higher as a result of policies. By 2020 the impact is estimated to be between 23% and 26%. Policies are estimated to be adding between 1% and 14% to energy bills for high-energy users in 2013 and between 6% and 37% in 2020. The range depends on their electricity/gas mix. The government has put several measures in place to compensate the most intensive users so as to try to prevent them from becoming uncompetitive in world markets. </body>

      <description>US spying: Pragmatism tempers EU anger</description>

      <body>In the end pragmatism out-pointed outrage. France and Germany have opted to talk with the Americans rather than preside over a rupture in transatlantic relations. That should not disguise a very real sense of betrayal in parts of Europe. Chancellor Angela Merkel was clearly not placated by her phone call with President Obama. His words had been chosen too carefully and it is widely believed in Germany that one of the chancellor's phones had been monitored in the past. "Words will not be sufficient," she said, "true change is necessary". So Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande met at the summit in Brussels and drew up a plan. They are looking to establish a common framework with the United States over intelligence-gathering by the end of the year. They want a new set of rules with a "no spying pact" at the core. This would mirror a similar arrangement the US has had with Britain, Australia, Canada and New Zealand since just after the World War II. It is unclear, however, where lines would be drawn and how enforceable any pact would be. President Hollande was clear that this was not about weakening ties with America. "What is at stake," he said, "is preserving our relationship with the US. That should not be changed by what happened, but trust has to be restored." There is an underlying reality here: Both Germany and France's intelligence services co-operate with the US closely in monitoring countries like Russia, China and Iran, and neither President Hollande nor Chancellor Merkel wants to change that. The German chancellor was dismissive of suggestions that talks about a free trade deal be postponed until trust between Europe and the US had been restored. She was not prepared to delay a negotiation which promises such rich dividends. Angela Merkel was asked whether she could trust the British and its intelligence agency GCHQ. She sidestepped those questions and spoke about allies serving together in conflict without needing to worry about surveillance. She was also asked whether David Cameron had given assurances that the UK would not spy on its European partners. She implied further discussions were needed, with a view to placing the activities of the intelligence services on a firmer basis. In the end the summit agreed that "intelligence gathering is a vital element in the fight against terrorism". But there was a warning that "a lack of trust could prejudice the necessary co-operation in the field of intelligence-gathering". Spying by its very nature works in the shadows and working out an agreement between Europe and the US will be difficult. In the meantime the reputation of the US in Europe has been damaged by these revelations. </body>

      <body>The adult-themed crime game, Grand Theft Auto 5, has won the top prize at the Golden Joystick awards. Rockstar's controversial game - where players commit crime in the fictional city of Los Santos - was presented with the Game of the Year gong at a ceremony in central London. Sony's The Last of Us also scooped two awards. Ken Levine - the man behind Bioshock and System Shock 2 - was honoured with a lifetime achievement award. The Golden Joysticks are the largest publicly-voted video game awards in the world, with this year more than 10 million people casting a vote. The Lifetime Achievement is a new addition to the ceremony. Mr Levine has been a high profile figure in the industry ever since he worked with designer Doug Church, on the first-person shooter, Thief: The Dark Project, credited with being one of the first titles to introduce the concept of stealth into video games. "The great thing about the still-maturing nature of video games is you get to be inspired by the work of novices and veterans alike," he said. "We're all figuring out day by day exactly what the medium is capable of." Now in its 31st year, the awards were first given out back in 1983, with the first Game of the Year award going to Jet Pac on the ZX Spectrum. Andy Robinson, editor of Computer and Videogames, said that three decades on, the awards still "represent the voice of gamers worldwide". "We've revamped the categories to reflect the diversity of modern gaming and also added the inaugural Lifetime Achievement award, which has made this year's ceremony the most thrilling for us yet," he said. The Golden Joysticks are not the only big awards for the video games industry. The British Academy of Film and Television Arts hands out its Video Game Baftas in the spring each year, although the majority of their awards are selected by a panel of experts, rather than a public vote. Grand Theft Auto 5, released last month, quickly became the fastest selling entertainment product ever, taking just three days to generate $1bn (£620m) in revenue. </body>

      <description>Wikipedia begins piloting a service that sends articles via text message, primarily aimed at users in Africa.</description>

      <body>Wikipedia has begun piloting a service that sends articles via text message, primarily aimed at users in Africa. The online encyclopaedia has partnered with mobile operator Airtel to offer the free initiative which is being tested out in Kenya. It is hoped the service will be used to reach people who do not have internet access. The trial will be active for three months, said Dan Foy, technical partner manager for the Wikimedia Foundation. "Throughout most of the developing world, data-enabled smartphones are the exception, not the rule," he wrote. "That means billions of people currently cannot see Wikipedia on their phones." To activate the service - called Wikipedia Zero - users need to dial *515#, after which they will receive a text message prompting them to search for articles. Adoption of cheap mobiles in Africa is widespread, and in many regards the mobile industry across the continent is more advanced than in more developed parts of the world. For instance, the sending of money via text message is extremely popular - one service, M-Pesa, boasts 17 million users in Kenya alone. Western technology companies see the region as a major source of future growth. Facebook, for example, is approaching saturation point in its current markets, and so it is looking at methods to adapt its services to suit those with more basic technology. The social network also launched a drive to get other technology companies looking at ways to make access easier - starting with bringing down costs of accessing mobile data. Tom Jackson, who edits African technology news website HumanIPO, said Wikipedia's initiative would be warmly welcomed. "There has been a steady move towards putting educational material online in many African countries, led mainly by the private sector rather than governments, but access to the internet remains a problem given that most Africans surf on their phones rather than browsers. "This step increases the chances of access, especially as there is functionality to provide Wikipedia via SMS. Feature phones are still dominant in Africa, so this is a helpful addition." He added: "I just hope it comes with the same warnings that European and American kids are given about taking Wikipedia at face value!" Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>The FBI has issued wanted posters for a man they say is behind an eBay car scam that has netted $3m (£1.8m). Authorities in the US also want to track down six other fugitives in relation to the charges. The gang were described as "masters of illusion" who convinced people to pay for cars that did not exist. "They thought their distance would insulate them from law enforcement scrutiny. They were wrong," said US attorney Loretta Lynch. The FBI put out a wanted poster for 33-year-old Romanian Nicolae Popescu, charging him with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. "They siphoned funds from victims to fuel their greedy desires and created false identities, fake websites and counterfeit certificates of title in order to make the scheme more convincing," said FBI Assistant Director, George Venizelos. "Popescu and his co-conspirators were masters of illusion, but they can't escape their ultimate reality. "With the help of our law enforcement partners at home and abroad, we will bring them to justice." In a statement, eBay said: "We have partnered with law enforcement to alert consumers about the type of scams described in the indictment - which involve exploiting well-known, trusted brand names like eBay to attract consumers and then lure them onto fake websites and into fraudulent transactions. "Auto shoppers can be confident in their purchase by ensuring they start and complete their transactions on eBay Motors and never use money wire services to send payments." In a recorded conversation, the FBI said Mr Popescu boasted that he was "beyond the reach" of US authorities. As well as eBay, the gang is said to have used Cars.com, AutoTrader.com, and CycleTrader.com to sell the non-existent cars, usually priced between $10,000 (£6,150) and $40,000 (£24,700). "After the 'sellers' reached an agreement with the victim buyers, they would often email them invoices purporting to be from Amazon Payments, PayPal, or other online payment services, with instructions to transfer the money to the US bank accounts used by the defendants," an FBI statement explained. Romania has gained increasing notoriety as a hub for cybercrime. A report from technology magazine Wired detailed a town dubbed "Hackerville" by locals - where cybercriminals are said to learn their craft at an early age. </body>

      <body>Twitter has unveiled the price range for its shares when the company lists on the stock exchange. In a filing on Thursday, Twitter said it planned to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20 (£10 - £12) to raise up to $1.4bn (£865m). The offering represents 13% of Twitter and values it at as much as $11bn. Analysts said the valuation, which was less than forecast, indicated the firm wanted to avoid the dip in prices that followed Facebook's listing. "They're trying to price this for a very strong IPO, ideally creating the conditions for a solid after-market," said Brian Wieser of the Pivotal Research Group. Facebook's shares were priced initially at $38 per share. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45 but later slumped. Some analysts had blamed over pricing of the shares as a reason behind the fall. However, Facebook shares have since recouped most of their losses and are now trading above the listing price. Twitter's share sale on the New York Stock Exchange will make it the biggest internet company to go public after Facebook. The microblogging site has seen steady growth since its launch seven years ago. According to its IPO documents, it now has 218 million monthly users and 500 million tweets are sent a day. However, all those users and tweets have not yet resulted in a profit. Twitter made a loss of $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. Some analysts said that while the lower-than-expected pricing may help its share prices in the days after the listing, in the long run investors would still need to see the firm make profits. "The fact that the valuation is lower than expectations, I think was smart by the underwriters. I think it will help the pop," said Michael Yoshikami of Destinational Wealth Management. "But in the end, even for $11bn, the question is can they come up with earnings to substantiate that number? And it's unclear that they're going to be able to do that." Almost 85% of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising on its site. There are three main ways for a company or an individual to advertise on Twitter: by promoting a tweet that will appear in people's timelines, promoting a whole account, or promoting a trend. Twitter tends to charge its advertisers according to the amount of interaction their content generates. Some analysts say the company has showing strong signs of growth, with revenue rising from just $28m in 2010 to $317m by the end of 2012. One research firm, eMarketer, has even estimated that Twitter's revenues from advertising sales will increase by more than 100% by the end of this year. </body>

      <title>MEPs vote to suspend US data sharing</title>
      <description>A non-binding vote in the EU represents growing unease about the amount of data Europe has shared with the US.</description>

      <body>The European Parliament has voted to suspend the sharing of financial data with the US, following allegations that citizens' data was spied on. The allegation forms part of leaked documents from whistleblower Edward Snowden. The vote is non-binding but illustrates MEPs' growing unease over how much data was shared with the US. It comes a day after it was alleged that German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone calls were monitored. The European Parliament voted to suspend its Terrorist Finance Tracking Program (TFTP) agreement with the US, in response to the alleged tapping of EU citizens' bank data held by the Belgian company SWIFT. The agreement granted the US authorities access to bank data for terror-related investigations but leaked documents made public by whistleblower Edward Snowden allege that the global bank transfer network was the target of wider US surveillance. MEPs also want to launch a full inquiry into the alleged spying. The row over exactly how much snooping was done on European citizens appears to be escalating. Germany has summoned the US ambassador in Berlin over the claims that the US monitored Mrs Merkel's mobile phone calls. Other leaders are also likely to want further clarification from Washington over the activities of its National Security Agency (NSA) in Europe. Meanwhile student group, europe v facebook, is launching a fresh attack on how deeply the social network was involved in the US spying programme. It has won the right for a review of why the Irish data protection commissioner is not investigating the amount of European data shared with the US. Commissioner Billy Hawkes has previously claimed that there "is nothing to investigate" over Facebook's role in the PRISM programme. Max Schrem, who heads the group, remains unconvinced. "When it comes to the fundamental rights of millions of users and the biggest surveillance scandal in years, he will have to take responsibility and do something about it," he said. </body>

      <title>3D printer 'gun parts' found in raid</title>
      <description>Greater Manchester Police say they "cannot categorically" state whether items seized in a raid are actually gun parts made by a 3D printer.</description>

      <body>A 3D printer and suspected "homemade" gun components seized during police raids in Manchester are being examined. Officers initially thought they could be a "plastic magazine and trigger" which would make a "viable" gun. But a man who was arrested in connection with the raid said the parts were sections of the 3D printer. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has now said it "cannot categorically say" whether the objects are the component parts for a gun. The arrested man, who has since been bailed, said: "It's nothing to do with a gun whatsoever. "I have no idea why they think it is part of a gun. It's designed by the company that makes the printer to go in the printer to make it better." The component suspected as being a magazine for a gun was in fact a "spool holder" for the 3D printer, he added. 3D printing technology works by building up layer upon layer of material - typically plastic - to create complex solid objects. The equipment was seized during a series of raids targeting organised crime. A force spokesman earlier said if the tests showed the parts could make a functioning weapon it would be the "first ever seizure of this kind in the UK". But experts have cast doubt on whether the printer was sophisticated enough to print gun components. Brian Derby, professor of material science at University of Manchester, said the seized printer appeared to be a hobbyist's machine. He said: "It would make something that would look like a gun but it would not work as a gun." Asst Ch Con Steve Heywood said: "We need to be absolutely clear that at that this stage, we cannot categorically say we have recovered the component parts for a 3D gun. "What we have seized are items that need further forensic testing by national ballistics experts to establish whether they can be used in the construction of a genuine, viable firearm." He added: "Clearly the fact we have seized a 3D printer and have intelligence about the possible production of a weapon using this technology is of concern. It is prudent we establish exactly what these parts can be used for and whether they pose any threat." The BBC's home affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani said the manufacture of guns through 3D printing was "almost inevitable" because of the relatively few firearms in circulation. "The worst-case-scenario would be a cheap and 100% reliable device that could be made overnight and then destroyed after just one use, disposing of crucial evidence to pin to a suspect," he added. Desktop 3D printers can be bought on the High Street for less than £1,000, but prices more complex models can cost £10,000. The world's first gun made with 3D printer technology was successfully fired in the US in May. The group that created the firearm, Defense Distributed, said it planned to make the blueprints available online. Defense Distributed is headed by Cody Wilson, a 25-year-old law student at the University of Texas, who defended making the design available by saying: "I'm seeing a world where technology says you can pretty much be able to have whatever you want. "It's not up to the political players anymore." At the time, Europe's law enforcement agency Europol said it feared criminals would follow suit as the technology became cheaper and more user friendly. </body>

      <body>Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, saw its losses narrow in the third quarter as its sales grew more than expected. It reported a net loss of $41m (£25m) for the July-September period. That is down from $274m a year earlier. The firm said that its sales surged 24% from a year ago to $17.1bn. The firm forecast its sales would grow further in the current quarter. That saw its shares rise by as much as 9.6% in after-hours trading in New York. RJ Jottovy, an analyst with Morningstar, said that "it looks like the revenue momentum will continue into the fourth quarter" despite the macro business environment being tough. Amazon said it expects fourth-quarter sales of $23.5bn to $26.5bn. Analysts had forecast revenue of $25.9bn. This is the third quarter in a row that Amazon has posted a net loss. However, the firm has been taking steps to try to turn around its fortunes. This includes expanding its Kindle line of e-readers and tablets and boosting its delivery network and cloud-computing services. The company has also been building more warehouses to reduce shipping costs and is adding robots to increase its efficiency in delivering orders. Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, said in a statement that ''it's been a busy few months" for the company. At the same time some of the services being offered by the firm have also helped to attract consumers. Mr Bezos added that one Amazon service called Prime had signed up "millions" of new members. The service offers free two-day shipping for eligible purchases. Members also get access to Amazon Instant Video and have the ability to borrow books from other Kindle owners. </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has reported a 26% jump in profit in the third quarter driven by strong smartphone sales and a recovery in its memory chip business. It made a net profit of 8.24 trillion won ($7.6bn; £4.7bn) in the July-to-September quarter, up from 6.56tn won during the same period a year earlier. Operating profit rose to a record 10.2 trillion won during the quarter. The firm said sales of smartphones, a key driver of its growth, are expected to rise further in coming months. It said that sales "will gain momentum due to year-end promotions over the holiday season and an improved line-up of mass-market smartphones". Samsung has posted record operating profit in six of the past seven quarters, mostly due to the growth of its smartphone division. The firm has enjoyed success in both the top-end as well as lower end of the smartphone market, giving it an edge over rivals such as Apple which makes only top-end phones. Its growth in the sector has seen it become the world's biggest smartphone maker. However, there have been concerns over whether Samsung can continue to grow at such a strong pace, not least because of increased competition and saturation of some key markets. "Samsung has done well, having rapidly caught up with Apple in the smartphone market. But I'm concerned whether Samsung would be able to do better," said Kim Sung-soo, a fund manager at LS Asset Management. "Like Nokia, Samsung may hit a limit in increasing market share. Apple is also fighting back, signalling an uphill battle for Samsung." Analysts said that the company needed to come up with more innovative products to help sustain its growth rate. For its part, Samsung has been taking steps in that direction. Earlier this month, it launched a smartphone with a curved display screen, beating its rival LG by at least a few months to offer a handset featuring flexible-screen tech. In September, it unveiled a smartwatch with a colour screen that can show alerts, be used for voice calls and run apps. Again, it edged firms such as Microsoft, Apple and Google to unveil such a device. Samsung's latest earnings were also boosted by its semiconductor business, which saw profit more than double to 2.1tn won, the highest in three years. Revenues in the division rose 12% over the previous quarter to 9.74tn won. The firm saw its bottom line buoyed by stronger chip prices after a fire at a plant owned by rival SK Hynix caused tightened supply in the market. Samsung supplies chips to other smartphone-makers, including its biggest competitor Apple, and expects demand to pick up as the year draws to a close. However, its consumer electronics division, which includes TV manufacturing, saw a decline in profit due to a drop in demand in China and Europe. But Samsung said that it expects the unit to bounce back in the current quarter, not least due to holiday season shopping during the end of the year. </body>

      <body>Microsoft reported better than expected earnings of $5.2bn (£3.2bn). Profits at the technology giant were up 17% from the same period last year. "Our devices and services transformation is progressing," said boss Steve Ballmer in a statement. He added that Microsoft is launching a "wide range" of new products in the coming quarter. The report shed no light on who is to replace Mr Ballmer, who announced plans to retire within the next year. The company has released several new products this quarter, including an update to Windows 8, and recently bought the mobile phone unit of struggling Finnish giant Nokia. Shares rose 6% in after hours trading on the strong results. For the first time, Microsoft also announced sales of its tablet computer, Surface. It said revenues from Surface "grew to $400 million with sequential growth in revenue and units sold over the prior quarter". Last quarter, the company was forced to take an embarrassing write down of $900m after sluggish sales. The computer, well-liked by reviewers, marked Microsoft's first foray into hardware manufacturing. However consumers, many of whom expressed displeasure at Microsoft's update to its popular operating system Windows, did not bite. The company still did not provide sales figures of the device. Investors hoping for any information about who will replace Mr Ballmer in the new year were disappointed. Earlier today, on a conference call to discuss earnings, Ford boss Alan Mullaly declined to comment on rumours that he was being considered for the top job. Other contenders include Stephen Elop, the former head of Nokia, who resigned as boss after Microsoft announced it would purchase the Nokia's mobile phone unit for 5.4bn euros ($7.2bn; £4.6bn) in September. Mr Elop is now head of Devices and Services at Nokia, although he is expected to transfer to Microsoft - where he was once a top manager - once the deal is completed. Mr Ballmer has been at the helm of Microsoft since 2000, and has been at the company since 1980. </body>

      <title>Ofcom reveals state of UK broadband</title>
      <description>Ofcom's annual report reveals that while some UK roads are 3G notspots, superfast broadband is now available for the majority of homes.</description>

      <body>While superfast broadband is now available to almost three quarters of UK homes, getting a connection on Britain's roads is more tricky, according to a report from Ofcom. Its annual infrastructure report looked at mobile coverage on roads for the first time. While motorways have good 3G coverage, just 35% of the UK's A and B roads are served by all four mobile networks. The report found that 9% of roads have no 3G coverage at all. The latest trends in mobile and broadband outlined by the report are designed to give a snapshot of the UK's communications market. Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of superfast speeds, defined by the watchdog as 30Mbps (megabits per second) or above. That equates to 22% of connections, up from 10% last year. There are several reasons why consumers may be reluctant to upgrade, thinks Andrew Ferguson from broadband news site ThinkBroadband. "The usual factors we encounter from consumers are resistance to any increase in price, and the £10 to £20 premium for faster services can deter many, particularly if paying under £10 for their broadband service now," he said. "There are also a good number who after not getting speeds close to the advertised speeds previously are wary of upgrading for little or no benefit," he added. The appetite for data is huge though - Britons use 650 million gigabytes in an average month, equivalent to more than one billion copies of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, according to the report. Ofcom believes that there are two main factors contributing to this deluge of data - the fact that many households have lots of devices wanting to connect to the internet and the need for high-quality on-demand TV services. Outside the home, people are also demanding more connectivity. According to the report the number of public wi-fi hotspots in the UK has doubled from 16,000 to 34,000 over the last year. The amount of data being sent or received from these hotspots has almost trebled, to almost 2 million gigabytes a month. Meanwhile 4G services continue to be rolled out by the UK's mobile operators. As well as looking at coverage on the UK's roads, Ofcom is also looking at 3G services on railways although the results will not be released until next year. "We know consumers increasingly expect superfast speeds, but it is also important to make sure people can connect over a very wide area. That is why we are doing everything we can to support moves to improve coverage in difficult areas such as roads and train lines," said Ed Richards, Ofcom's chief executive. </body>

      <title>Coated silicon to boost battery life</title>
      <description>Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors.</description>

      <body>Phone batteries that recharge in minutes and last for weeks could result from work on silicon super-capacitors. Created by American scientists, the components exploit properties of carefully engineered silicon slices to hold and quickly deliver a charge. Renewable energy sources could also benefit from the work on the cheaper super-capacitors. The silicon components should be easy to add to existing chip-production systems, said the researchers. Super-capacitors built from carbon are already used as energy storage systems in electric vehicles and in wind turbines to ensure blades turn smoothly, but their bulk and cost have limited them to these niche applications. Scientists in the engineering department at Vanderbilt University in Tennessee tested different materials to see if they could be used to reduce the cost and size of these super-capacitors. Silicon became a good candidate when the Vanderbilt team found a way to apply a coat of graphene that was only a few nanometres thick. This coating was needed to stop the silicon reacting with the chemicals that provide the ions used to store an electrical charge. The team, headed by engineering professor Cary Pint, used porous silicon in their research because the method of etching billions of tiny pits on to the material is well established. All those nano-scale features give the material a huge surface area relative to its size and help it store a significant electrical charge. Writing in a paper in the journal Nature, the scientists explained how the coating bestowed on the silicon properties similar to those seen in commercial super-capacitors. It allows them to dispense their stored power quickly and last much longer than current re-chargeable batteries. The team is now looking into ways to integrate the coated silicon into existing manufacturing processes so the super-capacitors can be more widely used in gadgets such as phones. One of the first applications of the work could be as a storage system for solar power plants. Super-capacitors on the rear of solar cells could store power as it is collected and then dispense it during the night when demand grows. "All the things that define us in a modern environment require electricity," said Prof Pint. "The more that we can integrate power storage into existing materials and devices, the more compact and efficient they will become." </body>

      <body>Samsung Electronics has apologised to Chinese consumers after a report carried on China's state TV claimed some of its phones were malfunctioning. The report alleged the phones were crashing due to faulty memory chips and criticised its repair policies. Samsung, which generates nearly 14% of its overall revenue from China. said it would provide free repairs for the seven models mentioned in the report. In a separate development Samsung was also fined by Taiwanese authorities. Taiwan's Fair Trade Commission levied a fine of fined 10m Taiwanese dollars ($340,000; £210,000) over allegations that Samsung had paid money to people to criticise rival's products. China is the world's second largest economy and the most populous country, The combination of a growing economy, rising income levels and a large consumer base has made it a key market for leading global firms. However, as foreign companies continue to grow their business in China, they have come under increased scrutiny. Samsung, which is the latest foreign firm to be criticised in the Chinese media, said in statement that it "sincerely apologises" to Chinese consumers for inconveniences caused by the company's "management problems" and that it welcomed the media scrutiny. The models mentioned in the China Central Television (CCTV) report on Samsung, which was aired earlier this week, include the Galaxy S3 and the Note2 phones. Earlier this week, a separate report on CCTV claimed that Starbucks, the world's largest coffee chain, was charging higher prices in China than in other major markets. It alleged that Starbucks earned higher margins in China due to its pricing. In April, Apple's chief executive Tim Cook apologised to Chinese consumers following two weeks of criticism by state-owned media over its repair and warranty policies, The media accused the firm of arrogance, greed and of "throwing its weight around". The fine in Taiwan came after an inquiry by the Fair Trade Commission alleged that Samsung had hired the services of an advertising firm, OpenTide Taiwan, to help it with online marketing. Sun Lih-Chyun, vice chairperson and spokesman, told the BBC's Cindy Sui in Taipei that its investigations had indicated that OpenTide had hired students and bloggers to post remarks about Samsung and also criticise rivals' products. He added that OpenTide gave weekly and monthly reports to Samsung, on online remarks, which indicated that Samsung was fully aware of what was going on. OpenTide was also fined 3m Taiwanese dollars by the commission for its role. The allegations had first come to light in April this year. At that time, Samsung had called the incidents "unfortunate" and said they had gone against the company's "fundamental principles". In early 2013, Samsung was fined by Taiwanese authorities for an advert that misled consumers about the camera on the Galaxy Y Duo. </body>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has told BT to change a TV advertisement, following complaints about claims it made about wi-fi interference. In the advert, BT said its new Home Hub could handle interference caused by gadgets that use the same radio spectrum as wi-fi. The ad showed gadgets such as mobile phones and radios, wrongly suggesting they could slow wi-fi speeds. BT said it would review its ad approval process in the wake of the ruling. The ASA said the advert was misleading because of the prominence it gave to devices, such as phones and radios, that did not interfere with wi-fi signals. In its judgement, the ASA acknowledged evidence cited by BT suggesting some non-wi-fi devices, such as baby monitors and video senders, could interfere with wi-fi but said these did not feature significantly enough in the advert. "We considered that the inclusion of images of mobile phones and radios implied that consumers who had those items in their homes may experience problems due to interference when we had not seen any evidence to that effect," it said. The ASA has told BT that the advert must not be broadcast in its current form. In an official statement , BT said the ASA had agreed that some household devices could interfere with wi-fi but conceded the watchdog's point that such devices had not featured enough in the advert. "We are reviewing our legal sign-off processes to ensure that creative visuals accurately reflect our substantiation in future TV ads," it added. </body>

      <title>Facebook in death clip policy U-turn</title>
      <description>Facebook takes down a video clip showing a woman being beheaded and says it has revised its guidelines over graphic content.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24635498</url>

      <body>Facebook has removed a video clip showing a woman's decapitation and issued new rules about what can be shared on its site. The U-turn comes two days after it was revealed the firm had dropped a ban on clips showing extreme violence. The BBC understands that Facebook did this in July after issuing new guidance to staff, but did not think the public would be interested to know. The British prime minister has accused the firm of being "irresponsible". Facebook's own safety advisers have also voiced concerns. The US firm now says it will still allow some graphic content but will take a more comprehensive look at its context. This time Facebook outlined its revised policy in a press release. "First, when we review content that is reported to us, we will take a more holistic look at the context surrounding a violent image or video, and will remove content that celebrates violence," it said. "Second, we will consider whether the person posting the content is sharing it responsibly, such as accompanying the video or image with a warning and sharing it with an age-appropriate audience. "Based on these enhanced standards, we have re-examined recent reports of graphic content and have concluded that this content improperly and irresponsibly glorifies violence. For this reason, we have removed it." At time of writing other decapitation videos could still be found on the site without warning messages. The announcement follows a series of flip-flops by the company. On May 1, when questioned about death clips being shared on the site, the firm told the BBC that its users had the right to depict the "world in which we live". However, less than two hours after the BBC published an interview with one of the firm's safety advisers - who raised concerns about the harm this could cause teenagers - it announced a change of tack. "We will remove instances of these videos that are reported to us while we evaluate our policy and approach to this type of content," it declared. The company promised at the time to announce its decision when the review was completed. But at the start of this week the BBC was contacted by one of the social network's members who had complained about a clip uploaded on 16 October, which the company was refusing to take down. "The video shows a woman having her head cut off by a man in a mask," the user wrote. "She is alive when this happens. Looking at the comments a load of people have reported this to Facebook and had the same reply." An Australian police force was among those who had complained. It said it had been told by Facebook's moderators that the video "did not violate our community standard on graphic violence". When questioned on Monday, a spokeswoman for Facebook confirmed that the ban had indeed been dropped and that the company had introduced a new rule: such material could be posted and shared on the site so long as the original post did not celebrate or encourage the actions depicted. This prompted David Cameron to tweet on Tuesday: "It's irresponsible of Facebook to post beheading videos, especially without a warning. They must explain their actions to worried parents." Stephen Balkam, the chief executive of the Family Online Safety Institute (Fosi) charity - who sits on the network's Safety Advisory Board - said he was "unhappy" at the move, which he had not been told about in advance. Many of the site's users also questioned why it allowed such extreme footage but banned images and videos showing a woman's "fully exposed breast". Facebook subsequently added an alert to the video, replacing the banner image with the words: "Warning! This video contains extremely graphic content and may be upsetting." But last night it changed its policy again, and visitors to the page are now told: "This content is currently unavailable." In response Mr Cameron tweeted: "I'm pleased Facebook has changed its approach on beheading videos. The test is now to ensure their policy is robust in protecting children." Mr Balkam also welcomed the move. "The Family Online Safety Institute is encouraged by the changes that Facebook announced today to the posting of graphic or disturbing material," he said in a statement. "In order to protect young people in particular, it is imperative that Facebook - and all other social media sites - have in place a review process for this type of material and provide warnings where appropriate." London-based Childnet International, another of Facebook's safety advisers, said it still wanted more information. "If they've taken it down I welcome that," said the charity's chief executive Will Gardner told the BBC. "But I want to find out more and look into this further." Google's rival Google+ social network has more restrictive guidelines on graphic content: "Do not distribute depictions of graphic or gratuitous violence," it states. There are videos on its YouTube service in which people discuss beheadings and provide links to explicit footage, but the firm has removed videos showing the act of murder from its own site. "While YouTube's guidelines generally prohibit graphic or violent content, we make exceptions for material with documentary, or news value," a spokesman added. "In cases where a video is not suitable for all viewers, we're careful to apply warnings and age-restrictions to safeguard people using our site." </body>

      <title>New top-level web domains announced</title>
      <description>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced.</description>

      <body>Four new generic top-level domains - the letters that appear at the end of web addresses, such as .com - have been announced. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (Icann) is expected to roll out the new names within weeks. They are: شبكة, the Arabic word for "web"; 游戏, the Chinese word for "game"; and the Russian words for "online" and "web site", онлайн and сайт. Icann hopes hundreds of new top-level domains will eventually be made. Until now, generic top-level domains (gTLDS) - as they are known - were limited to mostly familiar endings such as .com, .net and .biz. But Icann has decided to open this system up, inviting companies to submit applications for names they would like to register. Firms came forward to request almost 2,000 new names including the likes of .porn, .ninja, and .ferrari. The BBC expressed an interest in .bbc. Google made 101 requests, including .google and .youtube, and also had more unexpected ideas such as .and, .boo, .dad and .new. It will take some time for Icann to process all of those requests, particularly in cases where more than one firm wants to own the same gTLD - such as .music, requested by both Amazon and Google. The most popular domain name was .app - with 13 different companies interested in it. Wednesday's announcement marks the first set of domains in the new system to be approved. "You'll note that all four of these new strings are Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)," said Christine Willett, vice president of the gTLD program, in a blog post. "This will be the first time non-Latin characters can be used in a generic TLD." She added: "The move is an effort to create a more inclusive internet." The new domains will now "proceed to delegation", the final stage before being made live - expected to happen within the next couple of weeks. </body>

      <title>Teenagers' anti-sexting app launched</title>
      <description>A children's charity launches a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves.</description>

      <body>A charity has launched a mobile phone app to help teenagers refuse requests for explicit images of themselves. The free app from Childline offers users a choice of what the charity says are "witty responses" to send instead. "Sexting" - the sending of intimate images or videos by mobile phone or online - has become so common "it is considered mundane", the charity says. About six out of 10 of those aged from 12 to 15 are thought to own a smartphone. In a recent NSPCC/ChildLine survey, six out of 10 teenagers said they had been asked for sexual images of themselves. The survey - of 450 people - was self-selecting, but the charity said it reflected the results of other studies. The new app - called Zipit - also offers advice on safe online chatting and on what young people should do if they feel threatened or if an image becomes public. One 17-year-old boy told Childline sexting was "pretty normal" among his friends. "My friends and I talk very openly about our experiences within our relationships, and the sort of things we've sent each other. It seems like everyone's doing it." He said he sometimes got bad reactions to things he sent - but it did not bother him enough to stop. "Someone saw a video message I had sent to a previous girlfriend, took a screen shot and posted it online. They called me a pervert and lots of people I knew saw it. "I was completely devastated and, to be honest, almost suicidal." Peter Liver, from ChildLine, said: "We hope Zipit will give [young people] the tools to defuse the pressure to send, share or collect these images." The charity has also teamed up with the Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) to help young people get explicit images of themselves removed from the internet. </body>

      <title>Bletchley Park to offer web advice</title>

      <body>The home of Britain's World War II codebreakers will offer internet safety advice to children when a restoration project finishes next year. The Bletchley Park Trust hopes annual visitor numbers to the site near Milton Keynes will rise to 250,000. Software firm McAfee will be a partner in providing an IT learning zone and cybersecurity exhibition. The trust said it hoped the attractions would inspire the 16,000 children it expected to attend each year. Bletchley Park, which is currently open to visitors with tours and a museum, was the highly secretive site where teams, including the "father of computing" Alan Turing, broke the German Enigma codes. The trust is aiming to complete the work in time for the 70th anniversary of the World War II D-Day invasion of France, next June. The learning zone and security exhibition will be built in a derelict block on the estate. Ian Standen, trust chief executive, said: "The work undertaken at Bletchley made a real difference and helped to change the course of history. "We hope to inspire the next generation of potential codebreakers and cybersecurity experts to keep us safe in the digital world." Gert-Jan Schenk, European president at McAfee, said: "Working with Bletchley Park allows us to make a real impact on the cyber security education of children, not to mention the chance to help commemorate the part Bletchley Park played in the birth of the information age." </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>A senior White House official has been sacked after being unmasked as the man behind a widely read Twitter account that provided an abrasive commentary on his colleagues for more than two years. A government official said Jofi Joseph, 40, was fired from his job on the National Security Council nuclear non-proliferation team. Mr Joseph posted under the now defunct Twitter name @NatSecWonk. He apologised for his "inappropriate and mean-spirited comments". In his tweets, Mr Joseph gave a lacerating commentary on anything from policy to personal appearance. "Was Huma Abedin wearing beer goggles the night she met Anthony Weiner," he tweeted, referring to the scandal-hit former New York mayoral candidate and his wife, a former aide of Hillary Clinton. "Almost as bad a pairing as Samantha Powers and Cass Sunstein," he added, referring the US envoy to the UN and her husband, who is a former White House official. This month, Mr Joseph joined Republican attacks on Mrs Clinton for perceived failings of her handling of last year's attack on the US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. He tweeted that Mrs Clinton "had few policy goals and no wins" in the Middle East. He said Chelsea Clinton was "assuming all of her parents' vices" and targeted figures such as Republican commentator Liz Cheney and Mitt Romney's wife Ann for their looks and weight. Mr Joseph also turned his caustic commentary on Republicans. "So when will someone do us the favor of getting rid of Sarah Palin and the rest of her white trash family?" he tweeted last October. "What utter useless garbage." Mr Joseph's wife is reportedly a staff member for Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee. The Daily Beast website broke the news of his sacking, describing it as a shock and saying Mr Joseph was "well known among policy wonks". But it said that "inside the administration, there was little sympathy for the man who they feel had betrayed their confidence while taunting them all the while". The website Politico said White House officials had worked over months to discover the identity of Mr Joseph - a key member of the team negotiating over Iran's nuclear programme. It said his travel and shopping habits had been profiled by parsing over 2,000 tweets. Politico said his tweets had been "obsessively and angrily followed" by Washington officials, even though the messages had been "barely noticed" outside the capital. In an apology emailed to Politico, Mr Joseph said: "It has been a privilege to serve in this administration and I deeply regret violating the trust and confidence placed in me. "What started out as an intended parody account of DC culture developed over time into a series of inappropriate and mean-spirited comments. I bear complete responsibility for this affair and I sincerely apologise to everyone I insulted." </body>

However, the court of appeal rejected the claim that the report on the often provocative programme had damaged the company's reputation.

      <description>Meeting the faces behind technology's most iconic voices</description>

      <body>Millions of people hear their voices every day - but would you recognise them if you saw them walking down the street? Well maybe now you will. The BBC met the faces behind four of the most famous and iconic voices heard in technology today. Siri, Apple's voice-powered personal assistant, made its debut in June 2010. Since then, millions of the devices with the feature have been sold worldwide. In the UK, the voice you will hear responding to commands belongs to Jon Briggs, an illustrious voiceover artist whose portfolio includes the likes of the Weakest Link, Radio 2 and Channel 4. Jon had offered up his voice to a firm that specialises in computer-generated speech - that is, taking Jon's voice but moulding it to say virtually any possible phrase. Apple, when creating Siri, picked out Jon - unbeknownst to him. "I discovered that I was being used as the voice of Siri when Rory Cellan-Jones, the BBC technology correspondent, suddenly started demonstrating it on BBC Breakfast. "I thought 'I recognise that voice!', and so it was true - and it's a slightly bizarre journey since then." It means that while his voice is now being played out countless times a day all over the country, Apple has not paid him - he only received the fee earned he when recording the original material. But, he says he's excited to be "in early" on what he believes is changing how we use technology. "You can take a photograph of your desk - there is a screen a keyboard and a mouse. "You will show it to your children or your grandchildren and they will laugh and go 'you had a thing called a mouse? What's that funny thing with letters on?'" In contrast to the received pronunciation of her "Tube" voice, Emma Clarke's speaking voice is in fact Northern - growing up, as she did, in Sale near Manchester. Her voice can be heard across the Bakerloo, Central and District lines of London's iconic Underground network. The process of getting the job was long and painstaking - months of focus groups and whittling down possible candidates. During the selection, each possible voice was given a codename. Emma's, apparently, was 'Marilyn'. "Had they named me 'Brenda' I'm not sure I'd have got the gig," she jokes. She now gets fan mail from all over the world, particularly from Texas. "People initially thought I was actually on the train!" she says, "Or in some kind of central control room. I don't know where they thought it was." She says she is proud to lend her voice to the network, but adds that she hopes some of the lines she recorded never have to be heard by the public. "There were a couple of emergency announcements, that I remember when I read them on the script I thought 'oh god, imagine how these people will feel when they hear these announcements. "I felt such a sense of responsibility, of calming people down." Unlike the other voices in this piece, Terry Green is the only one who doesn't consider his voice to be his profession. He found his way to audio fame indirectly. He specialises in customer service, and the systems used in shops to get things moving and punters through the tills. And so it was, when the company he was working for needed a male voice to beckon people to the till, he stepped forward: "Cashier number three, please..." "We just sat down with a digital voice recorder, laid down the track, and that was it! I was on the prototype system, and then suddenly rolled out to 8,000 shops." They recorded up to cashier number 25 - but now the system goes much further. Indeed, around the world, the company's technology is used in thousands of stores - although with local voices instead of Terry's. Now he makes his living as a leading expert on the study of shoppers' behaviour. "My voice was on all these systems that we were rolling out, so I was becoming more and better known. I started writing white papers, and eventually I came to write a book." One morning, Sara Mendes da Costa was listening to Terry Wogan on Radio 2 when he mentioned that a competition would be held to find the new voice of the Speaking Clock. "A little bell rang in my head and I went 'oooh!'" She wasn't alone - within moments she had had calls friends and family saying she should put herself forward. She won, and from 2007 she took over the voice of the Speaking Clock, which is called up approximately 60 million times each year. It was a job she was excited, but nervous, to take on. "Brian Cobby, who sadly passed away last year, had the most beautiful, rich, Shakespearian voice. "Then I came along - I have visions of people going 'oh...'!" "But they wanted something different, someone a bit more of the moment, a little bit more who we are now." Sara uses the Speaking Clock regularly in her day-to-day work, and admits she just can't resist listening to each and every word. "I listen until when it goes through to 'precisely' - and only then I can hang up! "It's just a weird thing that I've got." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>The phone you can build like Lego</title>
      <description>The Dutch mobile you put together from separate modules</description>

      <body>A new mobile phone concept that would give users a chance to choose from a range of components, and replace or upgrade them when necessary, has generated enormous interest online. But could this sustainable, modular device ever become a reality? Six months ago, the Dutch designer Dave Hakkens took apart his favourite camera. "I noticed all these little parts," he says. "And everything was good except for the lens motor. That had broken." But when Hakkens contacted the manufacturer to get a replacement motor, he was advised to just replace the whole camera. "With your bike you repair the tyre, you don't throw the bike away," he says. "But for some reason this is what we do with electronics." Hakkens realised that if a device could be taken apart and upgraded more easily it would last much longer, minimising electrical waste. And so the idea of Phonebloks was born. The concept - Hakkens hasn't figured out how to actually make it - is for a phone with a replaceable screen and easily moveable, changeable "bloks", each containing a different element such as battery, chipset, gyroscope and so on. In the video Hakkens made to publicise Phonebloks, the bits fall into place on the backplate of the phone like pieces of Lego. The bloks vary in size and can be made to tessellate in any number of combinations. "Let's say this is your phone and you do everything in the cloud - why not replace your storage blok with a bigger battery blok?" asks the voiceover. "If you're like this guy and love to take pictures, why not upgrade your camera?" Last month, Hakkens set about showing off Phonebloks using the "crowd speaking" platform Thunderclap. Users donate their social reach to a project they support, allowing the site to commandeer their Twitter, Tumblr and Facebook accounts to broadcast a message at a single, predetermined moment. Hakkens was aiming for 500 people to sign up to his Thunderclap, but the Phonebloks video went viral, gaining seven million views in three days. He has now amassed 950,000 Thunderclap supporters and on Tuesday the Phonebloks video will ping across social networks 375 million times. "It comes down to a consumer signal," says Kyle Wiens, the founder of iFixit.com, a repository for user-generated repair manuals to the latest gadgets. "The market needs to indicate to manufacturers that we care about modular, repairable hardware." Phones have never been as modular as computers, but Wiens says they used to be sturdier and more repairable. Take batteries. Until the iPhone came along in 2007, batteries on all handsets could be readily removed. With every new phone the power source is a little bit harder to get to, stuck down with more glue, or tucked away in a case that's more impregnable. To get the battery out of the HTC One, the geeks at iFixit had to mangle the phone's casing and remove the motherboard. "I wish batteries were more replaceable than they are," says Bruce Harvey, an electrical engineer at Florida State University. "The reason they're not is in order to make the phone so small, the battery's shape is conformed to fit in there, rather than be a square block [like Phonebloks]." It is consumer preference for a small phone that has pushed manufacturers to hide their batteries away. In the same way, our craving for ever-slimmer, speedier phones has led them to pile hardware - such as the central processor, memory and wifi - on to the same chip, not separate them out into blocks. Harvey believes that Phonebloks is a technical challenge but an achievable one. The bloks could talk to one another if they were all designed to work with the same signalling system. However, he says the real difficulty would be in making a modular phone robust enough to survive the "harsh environment" of the trouser pocket. Each component would have to be encased in a material such as plastic, adding thickness and making the device less sexy. "It's one of those things where if people look at it they say, 'Wow, I can be more ecologically sound, I get upgrades when I want to…'" he says. "Then someone shows them that their phone's going to be six-tenths of an inch (1.5cm) thick or something like that. Reality will meet up with hopes and dreams." The challenge of marketing a modular system doesn't end with the chubbiness problem. "We sadly live in a disposable society and people do have an expectation that they will change their phone every so often," says Ben Wood, an analyst at CCS Insight (and proud owner of more than 800 handsets going back two decades). How long people hang on to a handset varies across the world. On average it's just over three years, but in the US it's just 20 months. Although new devices are almost always bought on a contract, people have come to regard their new phone as a "free upgrade". Lots of us wait impatiently for upgrade day - phone technology is advancing so fast that multiple components, though still functional, feel outdated after a couple of years. However, this trend may not continue indefinitely, Wood says. Mobile phones could be approaching an "innovation plateau" where the basics like speed and screen resolution are as good as they can get. Add to this the regular software "drops" that make our phones feel like new, and people might start hanging on to their handsets for longer. In this kind of market, Phonebloks might become viable, Wood argues. Home computers reached an innovation plateau some years ago, but while we replace our computers less frequently than we used to, not many of us exploit the modular nature of our PCs and upgrade the modules. However, in Hakkens's view that's because it isn't easy enough - only "die-hard geeks" are willing to reach for a screwdriver to unscrew their memory or motherboard. Price is arguably the least important factor in the mobile phone market, but it may represent another challenge for Phonebloks. In the long run, you might think consumers would save money with a modular system that can be continually upgraded and never needs chucking out, but this may not be the case. Big phone companies achieve enormous efficiencies of scale by negotiating special rates with parts manufacturers, buying up production capacity for months at a time. In return, the parts manufacturers get investment for research and development and a guarantee of future business. The idea of marketing "bloks" to end-consumers through a "blokstore" might not be so appealing to these companies, which might in turn prevent similar economies of scale being achieved. Hakkens recognises that neither the big phone companies nor the manufacturers that work with them are likely to jump at his idea - he sees it as a chance for other electronics companies to enter the fray. He says he has been approached by a number of companies and individuals excited about getting involved. "Right now, I'm thinking about what would be the best next step," he says. "Would it be to build it myself, open-source, online - or partner up with companies and collaborators?" He seems to have been caught off guard by the attention his little idea is receiving. "I wasn't planning to do a next step," he admits, "but now I have all these people offering help." Kyle Wiens and Ben Wood are enthusiastic about Phonebloks, but they both believe the concept might end in a half-way house - a phone in which the battery and screen, and possibly the memory and camera, can be easily replaced. For Wiens, the key to making a green phone is different - a design durable enough for the device to reach a second-hand market. "The whole phone doesn't need to be modular so long as it can be repaired and kept in service," he says. Dave Hakkens doesn't pretend to have all the answers, or even certainty that Phonebloks will see the light of day. "Half of the world says it's possible, the other half says it's not possible," he says. "I don't think anyone really knows because no-one's really tried it. So that's the next thing to do - just figure it out." Dave Hakkens spoke to Click on the BBC World Service - listen again to the programme on iPlayer or get the Click podcast.

      <title>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</title>
      <description>Can technology help avoid stampedes?</description>

      <body>It seems the cruellest and most unnecessary of deaths - to be crushed in the midst of a crowd. But even in the 21st Century such deaths are still common, as a stampede at a recent Hindu festival in India, which killed about 115 people, proved all too sadly. Horror quickly turned to anger as the Indian media reported that better crowd management could have prevented the tragedy. But can technology also play a role in making sure that such disasters are not repeated? At the Hajj pilgrimage, the world's largest Islamic gathering, which takes place in October, the authorities now use live crowd analytics software, which can not only spot problems in the crowd but also claims to be able to predict where overcrowding is likely to happen. Live data feeds come into a large operations room where they are analysed by military personnel, the police and other crowd managers. The software provides accurate and real-time data on crowd numbers, densities, distributions and flows. "Crowds can be dangerous places. Whether triggered by factions within the crowd, by natural disasters or misguided crowd managers, there is a long history of crushes, stampedes and failed evacuations," said Fiona Strens who co-founded CrowdVision, the firm behind the software. "It spots patterns of crowd behaviour that indicate potential danger such as high densities, pressure, turbulence, stop-and-go waves and other anomalies." As large-scale events go the Hajj is one of the biggest and it has a pretty bad track record; over the years thousands of lives have been lost. One of the worst incidents occurred in 2006 when a stampede on the last day of the pilgrimage killed at least 346 pilgrims and injured another 200. As part of his PhD research, CrowdVision co-founder Dr Anders Johansson analysed the CCTV images of the pilgrims before and during the crush in 2006, and realised that there were patterns of behaviours that, spotted early enough, could have prevented it. In 2007, his system was installed in Mecca and it has been monitoring the pilgrimage every year since. While the company doesn't like to tempt fate, since its involvement, no fatalities have occurred. That isn't entirely down to the technology though, admits Ms Strens. "In recent years the Mecca authorities have invested in better infrastructure, planning and technology to assure pilgrim safety but we play a very important role providing the real-time data and insights needed to inform operational decision-making," she said. For their part, the Saudi authorities are pleased to have such a technology partner. "The live crowd analysis greatly improves safety of pilgrims," said Dr Salim al Bosta, crowd management expert, at the ministry of municipal and rural affairs. But crowd scientist Keith Still, who was special adviser on the Hajj from 2001 and 2005, is more sceptical about how much technology can help in such places. "Any technology has to be coupled with a crowd management plan," he told the BBC. In fact he thinks that technology installed at the Hajj in 2006 - before CrowdVision's involvement - actually contributed to the tragedy that unfolded. "Tech firms offered the Saudis new systems and there was an over-reliance on technology. There was lots of digital signage put up to direct the crowds but it was just a mess," he said. He is also sceptical about whether the technology used by CrowdVision can work in a live situation. "It spots shockwaves in the crowd but if these are happening then you are already at a point where people could be crushed or seriously injured. Whoever is in control has fundamentally lost control of the situation by then," he said. "It could become an exercise in futility." For him, the value of CrowdVision lies more in its ability to precisely count how many people are at an event. "If you need to track capacity such tools are great but it is a long way away from being a risk management system," he said. Cities around the world are getting more and more overcrowded. By 2050 the UN expects the world's population to top nine billion, with nearly 70% of them living in towns. And people are spending more time in crowds. Large-scale music and sporting events are commonplace, as are big screens that beam events to public places to allow those outside of venues to watch the action. Spontaneous street protests are also on the rise, thanks to the proliferation of social media and smartphones. Technology that can monitor crowds is going to become increasingly important, thinks Ovum analyst Joe Dignan. "Understanding how people move through a city will help develop smart transport systems and keep people safe in times of danger whether natural or manmade," he said. Whether crowds gather to protest, to party or just to be entertained, things can turn ugly in an instant. Heat maps created by CrowdVision to show how people behaved during a practice evacuation of a city skyscraper illustrate how danger points can build up even when the crowd is flowing well and is relatively calm. The maps showed that even when the crowd was re-entering the building after the evacuation, there were some dangerous queues building up. Nowhere is crowd control more important than at a music festival and the software developed by CrowdVision suggests that organisers may be making fundamental errors by posting stewards at the front of crowds. "The maps suggested the problems were actually in the middle of the crowd," said Ms Strens. "If the stewards had tablets with real-time information on them, they could see exactly where they needed to be," she added. Such a solution may not have been realistic for Madhya Pradesh, the Indian state where the recent stampede occurred. It seems likely the stampede was sparked by panic, following rumours a bridge people were crossing was about to collapse. The bridge had itself been built in response to a stampede at the same temple some seven years earlier, when attendees had been crushed crossing the river. It illustrates that, however carefully planned an event is, there is often no accounting for human behaviour. Technology may help but it is only ever going to be part of the solution, according to Prof Still. "The best way to avoid this in the future is education on crowd safety," he said. </body>

      <title>Roller coasters set to get scarier</title>
      <description>The future of roller coasters</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24553630</url>

      <body>Technology has transformed the theme park thrill ride, fuelling a global arms race to create the fastest, tallest, scariest roller coasters the world has ever known. Alton Towers in Staffordshire has just opened the world's first 14-loop roller coaster, called The Smiler, while in Abu Dhabi, Ferrari World claims to have the world's fastest coaster. But are we reaching the limits of what the human body - and theme park budgets - can stand? What will the thrill ride of the future look like? Ferrari World's Formula Rossa ride blasts passengers from 0-149mph (240km/h) in just 4.9 seconds, with riders experiencing 4.8G during acceleration - G-forces only fighter pilots usually feel. Its huge 25-tonne hydraulic winch and compressed nitrogen gas system produces 21,000 horsepower, 20 times that of a Formula 1 racing car. John Wardley, designer of the Nemesis, Oblivion and Air rides at Alton Towers, said: "While we can withstand 6-8Gs for very short periods of time, if we experience 5G for more than five seconds, say, we're likely to black out. "We can't push people any further than they can go at the moment." On modern rides passengers experience about 3G in tight turns and loops, and zero G - the feeling of weightlessness - when upside down or flying over parabolic "bunny hills" and "camel backs". "We reached the limit of G-forces a while ago, but there is no technological limit to how fast or how high roller coasters can go - it's all down to money," said Justin Garvanovic, founder of the European Coaster Club. So what are the technologies that have enabled this move towards extreme rides? The big breakthrough was the linear synchronous motor (LSM), capable of launching passengers from 0-70mph in about two seconds. It is the same technology being developed by the US navy to propel jets from aircraft carriers as a replacement for the traditional steam piston catapult. LSMs employ a series of electromagnets fired in sequence, with power being supplied from the latest generation of highly-efficient batteries. They combine the launch, drive wheels and brake mechanisms all in one, allowing for blistering acceleration and equally effective braking by reversing the polarity of the electromagnets. Crucially, this allows designers to reverse the direction of the ride, doubling the thrills without doubling the length of track. The other major breakthrough has been 3D design engineering software from the likes of Autodesk, CATIA and Solidworks. "Our software allows designers to create highly accurate digital prototypes and understand how a ride will behave before they build it," Carl Bass, Autodesk chief executive, told the BBC. "It can predict the weakest point in the design; the likely fatigue rate of the materials; the speeds and G-forces." This software, together with tubular steel tracks, innovative car and harness designs, and LSMs, have given designers the freedom to incorporate multiple launches and all sorts of vertical rolls, loops and corkscrews traditional coasters could never have managed. For example, Projekt Helix, a 2014 coaster being developed by Mack Rides for the Liseberg amusement park in Sweden, will include two launches - Europe's first multi-launch coaster - accelerating riders to 62mph at 4.2G. The two-minute ride will include a "pretzel loop", a twisted air-time hump, s-curves and a zero-G roll. But insiders believe the thrill ride arms race is coming to an end because the costs are spiralling out of control. Rides can cost from £2.5m to £25m, depending on their size and sophistication, with the likes of Disney spending even more on themed rides involving elaborate sets and animatronics. Alton Towers' The Smiler cost £18m to build, while Projekt Helix will cost 23m euros (£19.5m). "People were spending stupid money and had to take a step back," said Mr Garvanovic. Steve Boney, spokesman for Maurer Soehne, a German thrill ride manufacturer, said: "There is a law of diminishing returns. As the magnets get bigger, they get heavier and much more expensive, and this pushes up the construction costs. Achieving an extra 50km/h [31mph] costs an extra three to four million euros [£2.5m-£3.5m]. "And greater speeds mean you have to increase the allowed rider heights, so fewer kids can go on the ride, reducing revenue," he added. As a result there is move towards dark - or indoor - rides where the experience of whizzing round a track is enhanced by audiovisual technologies, like much larger versions of current simulator rides. "The ride of the future will be an entertainment machine, as much about surprise, fun and enchantment as physical thrills," said Mr Wardley. Mr Boney agrees, saying: "Audiovisual technology is where most of the technological innovation is happening." For example, Dynamic Structures, the Canadian company behind the Harry Potter theme rides for Universal Studios, is currently developing a "coal mine-themed" ride for a client in Dubai that will incorporate thrill ride speeds and G-forces with 3D projection effects and robotics. "It will be the most technically advanced ride in the world," Craig Breckenridge, senior designer at Dynamic Structures told the BBC. "We're doing things with coasters that have never been done before, such as switching tracks, and using video and projections that will trick your brain into thinking you're really falling." At certain sections of the ride the cars will drop vertically, laterally, and backwards on a tilting piece of track that takes them underneath where they've just been, said Mr Breckenridge. So as the traditional thrill ride arms race comes to an end, it seems a new era of intense, multi-sensory, immersive dark rides is only just beginning. </body>

      <title>Mac v PC - the battle resumes</title>
      <description>Apple and Microsoft renew their rivalry</description>

      <body>Tuesday saw two big product launches on one day - and from each, interesting signs that an old rivalry might be flaring up again. For 20 years Microsoft and Apple slugged it out - with Bill Gates' company the Goliath and Steve Jobs' firm the plucky David, mostly failing to be anything other than a noisy sideshow. Then competition intensified as Apple came roaring back with its iProducts, but in recent years both companies turned their fire instead on Google as the big new kid on the block threatening to take away their toys. But at Apple's event on Tuesday night, where a new, thinner iPad made the headlines, was more interesting for what it said about the renewed rivalry with Microsoft. It started with the unveiling of new, typically expensive - if very high-specification - computers, those objects supposedly made obsolete by the rise of the tablet. Tim Cook told the audience that this part of the business (from which, by the way, Apple only makes a tiny share of its huge profits) was still vitally important - and he mocked another company that didn't know whether it wanted a tablet to be a PC or vice versa. In the week that Microsoft's Surface 2 goes on sale, it was clear who he was talking about. The only real surprises in the 90-minute show came with the announcements that Mavericks, the latest version of the Mac operating system, would now be free to download and updated versions of its iWork apps, Apple's rival to Microsoft's Office software, would now come free on any new iOS device. Big deal, said anyone from the open source community, where the idea that you would pay for software has long been seen as old-fashioned. But it might be a concern for Microsoft. It still makes big bucks by charging for Windows and Office, so Apple's move could be seen as a direct threat to its business model. Mind you, there had been evidence earlier that Microsoft might at last be making progress in the area where Apple had left it far behind, mobile devices. I'd tuned into the live stream from Abu Dhabi of Nokia World, the phone giant's last big event before it disappears into the embrace of Microsoft. And I came away with two questions - is the Windows Phone operating system finally getting some traction, particularly on the latest Nokia Lumia phones? And does that mean Nokia's board sold the phone business at exactly the wrong time? Nokia's CEO Stephen Elop had the slightly strange job of unveiling some quite impressive new products and software, which will now contribute to the Microsoft bottom line, where he will be running the devices division or possibly the whole business. Lumia is getting larger, with the 1520 Phablet, and Nokia has at long last unveiled a tablet, the Lumia 2520, running the Windows RT operating system. Just how that will be marketed inside Microsoft, where so much has been invested in the Surface, will be an interesting question for Mr Elop. But the amount of innovation that has come out of Nokia in recent months has been truly impressive, in particular in the key area of mobile phone photography, where the Lumia 1020 seems to have the most advanced camera on the market. And finally that seems to be showing in sales, with the Wall Street Journal reporting that eight million Lumias were sold in the last quarter. True, that compares with nine million new iPhones sold in just three days. But momentum is key in this market, and at last Nokia, and hence Microsoft, is getting some. What still deters many from taking the plunge and embracing Windows Phone is a lack of compelling apps. So the most important announcement out of Abu Dhabi was the imminent arrival of Instagram, the vastly popular picture-sharing app whose absence has been a glaring hole in the Windows portfolio. And now there's another opportunity for Windows to make progress at the business end of the mobile industry. With confidence seeping away fast from Blackberry, many organisations will be pondering where to take their business next. Some have already switched to the iPhone, others will wonder about Android, although they may have concerns about security. But enterprises which already have a long-term relationship with Microsoft - and that's just about all of them - may now think that Windows Phone devices can offer them a safe solution to their needs. The Mac v PC battle is going mobile - and if Microsoft does at last manage to make an impression in this world, there could be huge rewards. Nokia's board will then ask itself whether it got the right price for all that innovation now under the control of its former CEO in Redmond. </body>

      <title>Saving digital art from early death</title>
      <description>The race to save computer-generated artworks</description>

      <body>When a renaissance masterpiece needs restoring, simple paints and brushes can do the job. It's all down to human skill. But what do you do when a piece of digital art worth over a million pounds and reliant on obsolete technology and old codes breaks down? The ZKM Centre for Art and Media in Karlsruhe Germany is trying to provide an answer. It has the world's largest collection of digital art, with over 500 pieces in its collection. It's also the global centre for digital art conservation. It is a Herculean effort to keep their artworks running in their original form on computers often decades old. ZKM's staff try to find as much obsolete digital kit as possible. They trawl waste dumps and the auction site eBay in their quest for authenticity. As part of these efforts, they rent a warehouse outside the city where they store over 1,600 cathode ray TV sets, which are now out of production. These old-school TVs make up key elements of some of the art works. For example, Versailles Fountain by digital pioneer Nam June Paik uses about 40 CRT TVs. They are constantly being repaired. In an unlikely alliance, curators at ZKM foster connections with local dump managers who set aside old computers and audio visual machines in exchange for cigarettes. But keeping all of this obsolete equipment in storage is just a short-term solution. Bernhard Serexhe is the principal curator at ZKM's media museum and leader of a European Union funded project on digital art conservation. He says the faster technology develops, the shorter the potential lifespan of the art. "That is why we need a second strategy which is migrating the work, migrating the data of the work to a different platform, or even porting the programme to a different system, to a different computer system which is quite complicated and quite expensive," he says. This is precisely what happened with The Legibile City. Created in 1989 by Jeffrey Shaw, it is considered by Mr Serexhe to be one of the most important pieces of digital art in the world. When you get on the stationary bike, you can cycle through giant 3D letters in three different cities. The faster you pedal, the faster words describing the city appear on screen. The problem is it was designed on a Silicon Graphics computer which went out of production 16 years ago. The museum only has 10 left in storage. The danger is when they are gone the artwork will no longer be displayed. The solution for The Legibile City has been to port it over to a Linux-based operating system. This process took several years and was done in conjunction with the artist's wishes.  "Linux was selected as the target platform for the porting. Linux is a free Unix variant that runs on the most diverse hardware platforms -including on Apple computers - which is constantly being adapted to new hardware, and, current expectations are that due to its origins [Unix], it will have a long lifespan," Mr Serexhe explains. Digital artworks in ZKM are not switched off overnight to preserve the systems and try to prolong the life of the hardware. Not everything in the museum is "born digital", a phrase used by Mr Serexhe to describe art that is completely of the digital age. Digitising video art from magnetic tapes is another important part of the museum's work. Dorcas Muller works in the Laboratory for Antiquated Video Systems. Her office is packed from floor to ceiling with ancient tapes and video equipment. She has over 300 machines at her disposal to convert about 50 different formats into digital form. "The most important machines which are completely restored we keep in the laboratory for daily use and we have storage outside the city where we have machines up to the ceiling for future years," she says. The market for pure digital art is very different from the one for more conventional art. Materials and machines become obsolete while canvas and stone live on. "There is a certain market but normally these works go from the artists to the collector… there are only very few collectors. In Germany at the moment there is only one private collector of digital art," says Mr Serexhe in Germany. But there is no consensus on whether repairing digital art is the right thing to do. Some of the artists may have intended their works be shown as a performance, and to cease existing when the technology running it breaks down. The museum's efforts are controversial. "Either we change our ethical aspect ideas about art, and we would consider digital art as only 'performative', or we stick to the originality and authenticity of the work. "I think as an important collection we still should preserve the work in its original form and format as long as this is possible," Mr Serexhe says.

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <title>Crowdfunding the arts in South Africa</title>
      <description>South African musicians ask their listeners to turn investors</description>

      <body>Money for a Monteverdi melody, and Bach for their buck. The Cape Consort is a Cape Town-based ensemble in search of investment to help them put on a concert. As with many struggling artists, they are in need of funding. After all, "musicians need to pay rent and eat just like everybody else," says Hans Huyssen, cellist with the group. The Cape Consort has turned to crowdfunding, an online collective fundraising approach. They achieved their target amount of 15,000 rand ($1,525; £945), raising 60% of that in just six days. The funds raised allowed them to put on a series of concerts, with the last one having just taken place on Sunday in Cape Town. Instead of approaching one investor to ask for capital, crowdfunding is an online platform that allows small initiatives like Cape Consort to post proposals on a dedicated website and ask the world wide crowd for funding. Even though the concept of collective fundraising is not new, (New York-based Kickstarter is widely credited with pioneering online crowdfunding in 2009), one crowdfunding website in South Africa is using it in an unusual way, to get funding for the arts. Patrick Schofield is the founder of Thundafund, described as a "crowdfunding cafe" for African innovators and creative entrepreneurs. It provides both a crowdfunding platform together with mentorship. "I think the funding is one thing but people need the supporting environment to help them realise their idea and to make it successful, and that's what we bring together," he says. Thundafund has been up and running for over four months, and 80% of the projects that have gone on the website have gained funding. Michelle Constant is the chief executive of Business and Arts South Africa (BASA), a public-private partnership that aims to build partnerships between business and the arts. "It's simplistic to assume that the private sector and the government can do all the funding of the arts as we move forward into the future," she says. Funding arts projects will always take a backseat to issues such as reducing poverty and improving healthcare and housing - issues which are key in Africa. "So if there is an opportunity where people who in their individual capacity can give [to the arts], it's exciting," says Ms Constant. But crowdfunding for the arts is about more than just funding a specific project - it's also about tapping into a more engaged audience by using technology as a platform. Mr Schofield compares the power of crowdfunding as a vehicle for raising money to the power of social media when it comes to current affairs. "When you talk to 100 people and say, 'look, I'm not asking you for a huge amount, instead I'm going to say back me with a small amount and together we'll all make it happen' - in many ways it's the same way as news is fed through Twitter. "There's 100 people talking about the event and it's often so much more powerful than one voice and they will funnel 100 people together to a larger channel." With crowdfunding, as with any investment, you get a return. However, rather than a financial return, what you're most likely to gain is a creative product, be it a book, play, performance or CD. On the other hand, unlike with a financial product, you know exactly what you're getting for your money as those who are doing the crowdfunding have to be upfront about what they can offer. For instance, for an investment of 50 rand the Cape Consort will put your name on their website. Meanwhile, for 20,000 rand you can get four tickets to one of their performances, signed programmes, and an exclusive private concert among other things. But can online crowdfunding work in a country where so many people don't have access to the internet? Media analyst Arthur Goldstuck says it is already working, adding that while the digital divide may not be an issue, there are challenges. "Those who have the means to participate in crowdfunding wouldn't really be the 'have-nots', so in South Africa the 'haves' have relatively good internet access… so that really isn't the constraint," Mr Goldstuck says. "The constraint is more around trust of the crowdfunding model and the essence of crowdfunding is you have to hype up your product and create enthusiasm for it and that's not how investors like to be drawn into an investment opportunity." Thundafund's Patrick Schofield also believes that the crowdfunding model can be an ideological tool that can bring about change. He calls crowdfunding "funds with benefits" and says it "allows us to make the world as we would like it". If the audience supports an idea online, the idea will come to life; if there's no support, there's no execution. This allows an interactive audience to dictate what they want to see in the creative arts arena by supporting it. As Hans Huyssen, from the Cape Consort, says, "music is not something that relies on musicians only. "I mean we can rehearse and perform, but unless somebody hears what we do, the musical experience doesn't happen. "So you're involving your audience not only in concert, but also in advance, and to make them aware that they have a responsibility for the music to happen." </body>
