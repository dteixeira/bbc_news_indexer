      <body>BT Sport has announced an exclusive £897m three-year deal to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League football matches. The broadcaster has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season from 2015 after talks with European governing body Uefa. A BT spokesman said it had "shaken up the UK TV market" and would make some matches, including finals, free to air. The news is a major blow to Sky and ITV, which currently share the rights. While BT said it was the first time a single UK broadcaster had won the exclusive live rights to all matches from the two tournaments, Sky said the deal was "far in excess" of its own valuation. "I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Champions League and Europa League," said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. ITV has been the free-to-air broadcaster of the Champions Leage since it launched in 1992. "We were not prepared to pay over the odds in the latest live rights round," read an ITV statement. "Viewers will be able to continue to watch both competitions free on ITV through to 2015 and we remain the home of live England football." The new contract, priced at £299m a season, is worth more than double the current arrangement, which could mean significantly more money for clubs in the two European competitions. Each of the 32 teams in the group phase of the Champions League currently receive a participation payment of around £7m and £396,000 for every match played in the group stages. The winners get more than £30m in total. As part of the deal, BT has said it will show at least one match involving each participating British team for free every season. "We are new to the market. The key for us is growing our broadband business. We are available on all platforms. If customers do not want to be BT broadband customers, they can pay for the service as well," Patterson told BBC News. John Petter, boss of the company's consumer division, added: "Today, to get the whole competition, you typically have to pay Sky £40 or so a month. The pricing is not being announced today, but I can say that this will be far more affordable than currently." However, Sky indicated its rival had paid much more than it was prepared to offer. "We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation," read a statement from Sky. "There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more. "Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering." BT launched its UK sports channels on 1 August 2013 in a challenge to the dominance of sports coverage on Sky. BT has already spent £738m over three years for the rights to show 38 live Premier League matches for the 2012-13 season, while Sky paid £2.3bn for 116 matches a season. Other events in the BT portfolio include the rights to Premiership Rugby and motorsports such as Moto GP and Nascar, as well as taking over ESPN's UK sports channels. Only last week, it said more than two million people had subscribed to its television sports channels since August and reported six month pre-tax profits of £948 million. For its part, Sky announced in October that record numbers had tuned into the start of the football season  - with an average audience of 1.55m compared with 1.29m last year. BBC News business correspondent Joe Lynam said: "Sky has achieved well over 10 million paying subscribers in the UK. The backbone of that success is well-presented live football coverage. "While Sky has seen off challenges from ITV Digital, ESPN and Setanta, BT is posing the most formidable challenge. "BT is already in almost every UK home with a telephone line and is also the largest broadband provider in the market. It isn't charging anything to show live Premier League football for existing broadband customers but will be charging for some Champion League games from 2015, although no pricing structure has been published. "Their aim of becoming the home of live football coverage in Britain takes a giant step forward with this announcement and might even have an impact on Sky shares when trading restarts on Monday." </body>

      <title>Murder 'must not besmirch marines'</title>
      <description>The PM says a Royal Marine's conviction for murdering an Afghan should not "besmirch" the organisation, as an ex-commander urges sentencing clemency.</description>

      <body>The conviction of a Royal Marine for murdering an injured Afghan insurgent should not "besmirch" the organisation, Prime Minister David Cameron has said. Speaking to marines at Downing Street, Mr Cameron said the "appalling" case in no way represented the spirit and proud history of the Royal Marines. The sergeant, identified only as Marine A, was convicted over the shooting of the unknown man in 2011 on Friday. A retired commander has said he should be shown leniency when he is sentenced. Addressing a group of serving and former Royal Marines raising funds for the Commando 999 charity, Mr Cameron said the Royal Marines had "one of the proudest histories of any in the world". "We should not let that single incident besmirch the incredible work the Royal Marines have done, not only over decades but over centuries," he said. The prime minister also thanked the marines for the "incredible work" they had done in Afghanistan, saying he believed "we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high". Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was a "tragic" incident and must be dealt with, but the case did not change the "esteem in which our armed forces are held". Marine A faces a mandatory life sentence but a minimum term will be set on 6 December. Maj Gen Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade during the Falklands War, said a five-year or 10-year term would be more appropriate than life. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the shooting of the Afghan insurgent in Helmand Province was "totally wrong, totally unforgiveable" and it was "quite right" that Marine A would be sentenced. But he said we did not know what pressure the sergeant might have been under in the past. "I understand that he's quite an experienced guy. People are talking about him being battle hardened and therefore there is no excuse. "Well actually it's the other way round, the more times you do tours in that filthy war, the more pressure there is on you," he said. He said some sort of clemency should be exercised. "He certainly shouldn't serve any less than five years, maybe 10. I hope that his behaviour and the fact he truly regrets what he did would be taken into account when the time comes," he said. Military commentator Colonel Mike Dewar said he was "horrified" by Marine A's actions but echoed calls for clemency, saying society had to make "exceptions for soldiers in extraordinary circumstances". "These soldiers have had their officer killed - their platoon commander, a very fine young man - they had seen their friends brutalised, lost legs, they had been under the pressures of battle for weeks and months," he said. But former Army Major Richard Streatfeild told the BBC it was too soon to tell what kind of sentence would be appropriate. "We don't know enough about his personal situation in terms of a plea of mitigation yet," he said. However, he said he agreed with Maj Gen Thompson about the "cumulative effect" war could have on members of the armed forces. It is the first time a member of the British forces has faced a murder charge in relation to the conflict in Afghanistan, which began in 2001. Two other marines were cleared after the trial at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. An anonymity order was granted last year to protect the three men from possible reprisals. The murder took place after a patrol base in Helmand Province came under attack from small arms fire from two insurgents. The Afghan prisoner had been seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field. One of the cleared marines - known as Marine B - inadvertently filmed the murder on his helmet-mounted camera and that footage, taken on 15 September 2011, was shown to the court during the two-week trial. It showed Marine A shooting the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol, and saying: "There, shuffle off this mortal coil... It's nothing you wouldn't do to us." He adds: "Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention," to which Marine B replies: "Yeah, roger mate." During the court martial, prosecutor David Perry told the court the murder was "not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. It amounted to an execution". Marine A told the court martial he had fired because of "poor judgement and lack of self-control", but said he had thought the insurgent was already dead. Marines B and C were accused by the prosecution of being "party to the killing" and of having "encouraged and assisted" Marine A to commit the murder. At the time of the killing, Marine A was an experienced sergeant, Marine B was new to the Helmand base, while Marine C was the most junior of the three. </body>

      <title>Glasgow to host 2014 MTV awards</title>
      <description>Glasgow is to host the 20th MTV Europe Music Awards next year at the new Hydro Arena, it is announced.</description>

      <body>Glasgow is to host the 20th MTV Europe Music Awards (EMA) next year, it has been announced. The event will be held at the city's £125m Hydro Arena, which opened in October, and has a capacity of 13,000. Bruce Gillmer, from Viacom International Media Network (VIMN), confirmed the ceremony would be held in Glasgow for the first time. It follows discussions between MTV, Glasgow City Marketing Bureau and EventScotland. The MTV EMA was held in Edinburgh in 2003. This year's event is taking place in Amsterdam on Sunday, and will include performances by Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Katy Perry, Snoop Dog and Kings of Leon. Mr Gillmer, executive vice president of talent, music programming and events for VIMN, said: "Each year, the MTV EMA is an amazing, multi-platform music experience for our audiences around the world, presented through a dynamic, talent-driven spectacle that only MTV can deliver. "As one of the world's great music cities, Glasgow is always a favourite with artists and the new SSE Hydro will provide the perfect backdrop for the MTV EMA in its 20th anniversary year. We're thrilled that the eyes of the music world will be on Glasgow next year." Councillor Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chairman of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, said: "It has been our ambition as part of Glasgow's major events strategy to attract the MTV EMA for a number of years and I'm delighted that MTV has accepted the city's invitation. "Glasgow proved to be the ideal destination for MTV Crashes in 2010, when Diddy Dirty Money and a fantastic crowd showed MTV's global audience that Glasgow is a city that knows how to party. "Since then, we've been working to bring the world's greatest music event to Glasgow and I'm delighted we can today announce the next chapter in this exciting partnership. "Hosting an event of the magnitude and international reach of the MTV EMA reinforces Glasgow's enviable reputation as one of the world's leading music cities." Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "2014 is going to be an incredible year for Scotland and it is fantastic news that the MTV EMA will be coming to Glasgow. "As a signature event on the Homecoming Scotland 2014 programme, we will welcome the world to the EMA and showcase Glasgow and Scotland to nearly 700 million households through MTV's global network of channels. "The awards are a highlight on the global music calendar and next year it is fitting that it should be held in Scotland, the perfect stage for events, in Glasgow's newest venue, the spectacular SSE Hydro." </body>

      <title>Water report 'says fracking is safe'</title>
      <description>A study by the water industry has concluded that "fracking" to extract shale gas is safe, the government says.</description>

      <body>A study by the water industry has concluded that "fracking" to extract shale gas is safe, the government says. Opponents say water used in the process could be contaminated and could enter domestic supplies. Water UK is due to release a report by the end of the year but told the BBC it believes any risks can be mitigated. Meanwhile, energy minister Michael Fallon has said shale gas exploration could soon take place in Wiltshire, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. Mr Fallon told the Daily Telegraph that, while exploration has so far been focused on the North of England, areas "right across the South" and the Midlands could also be investigated. Mr Fallon said: "There are genuine concerns, but there are also myths and we are tackling them." The Conservative MP for Sevenoaks added that the regulatory barriers to fracking had been lowered. The Department for Energy and Climate Change said a report being released later this year would conclude the process of extracting shale gas from rock would not contaminate the water supply. A spokesman for Water UK, which represents the industry and has carried out the report, said: "There are risks. But they're risks we feel could be mitigated." But Friends of the Earth south east campaigner Brenda Pollack said: "Despite all the government hype, people across the South have made it perfectly clear that they are opposed to fracking." Fracking - or hydraulic fracturing - involves pumping water and chemicals into shale rock at pressure. It was temporarily banned in the UK after it was blamed for two earth tremors in Blackpool in 2011 but a government review concluded it was safe if adequately monitored. Efforts to explore its possible use in Balcombe, West Sussex, sparked protests earlier this year and last month Greenpeace said it was planning legal challenges to stop companies from fracking in England. Greenpeace spokeswoman Anna Jones said fracking "is risky for local environments, risky for our water supplies and risky for the global climate". "People are right to stand up and say 'Not under my land you don't.'" Greenpeace said a number of residents in areas of potential fracking sites, including Sussex and Lancashire, were joining the campaign. Mr Fallon has previously expressed support for fracking. In October, he said it would be "irresponsible" not to support firms trying to access shale gas and predicted dozens of test wells would be drilled over the new few years. And, in August, he defended comments he made apparently joking about the effects of fracking on people living nearby after he told a private meeting the possibility of the process starting in various southern counties was being explored. "All these people writing leaders saying, 'Why don't they get on with shale?' We are going to see how thick their rectory walls are, whether they like the flaring at the end of the drive." </body>

      <title>Queen to attend Remembrance festival</title>
      <description>The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the annual Festival of Remembrance, as events to honour Britain's war dead get under way.</description>

      <body>The Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the Festival of Remembrance, as part of a three-day commemoration of Britain's war dead. The event at the Royal Albert Hall honours those who fought and died in conflicts past and present. Meanwhile, football grounds paused shortly before the 15:00 GMT fixtures as a minute's silence was observed. On Sunday, there will be Remembrance services and on Monday a two-minute silence to mark Armistice Day. At noon on Saturday, Afghan war widows marched with widows from World War Two, the Korean War and the Gulf War to the Cenotaph in Whitehall for a 30-minute service. And in the Middle East, more than 100 RAF service personnel from the 83 Expeditionary Air Group were among the first to mark the commemoration, with a sunset ceremony at their base. This year's Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance also marks the 70th anniversaries of the Battle of the Atlantic and the Dambuster raids. A television audience of 5.2m is expected to watch the event - to be broadcast at 21:15 on BBC One - which will feature performances by singer James Blunt, Katie Melua, the tenor Alfie Boe and new group, the Poppy Girls. As well as the Queen and Prince Philip, other members of the Royal Family are expected to attend, including the Earl and Countess of Wessex. Tributes from performers will be interspersed with real-life stories from some of the former and serving forces personnel the Royal British Legion helps every year. The Poppy Girls, an all-girl group picked from a search for talent among forces families, will be performing their new single The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye) which is raising money for the Poppy Appeal. The Royal British Legion's director general, Chris Simpkins, said: "The festival will provide a moving and engaging show here in London and for viewers across the country, but more importantly it helps us to reach out to wider audiences and offer the public an opportunity to pay their respects, and remember those who, in past and present conflicts, have made sacrifices in the course of duty." Before the festival, there will be a short ceremony where the former South Steps at the Royal Albert Hall will be renamed the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Steps. The War Widows' Service is organised by the War Widows' Association (WWA), which has more than 4,000 members. Alberta McMenemy, 65, of the WWA, said the service was special to many. "It brings back memories about when our husbands died. It is good that there is an appreciation for those who have lost their lives," said Mrs McMenemy, who has been a widow since her husband died fighting in the Gulf War in 1990. The Cenotaph in central London will also be the focus of the national service of Remembrance on Sunday, while a two-minute silence will be held at 11:00 on Armistice Day, to commemorate the end of World War One. Ahead of this weekend's events Prince Harry and Prince Philip visited the Field of Remembrance outside Westminster Abbey to pay their respects and observe a two-minute silence. On Saturday morning, Commando 999 raised money for the "Royal Marines Family" by attempting to break the world speed march record. They tried to carry kit and weapons weighing over 40lbs (18kg) 26.2 miles (42km) through central London in under four hours 19 minutes to commemorate the Royal Marines' 350th birthday. The Royal Marines were quicker than previous attempts but did not beat the record as one man had to pull out half a mile before the end. They completed the race around London in four hours, 17 minutes and 21 seconds. They raised more than £20,000 to help Royal Marines who have been affected mentally and physically by war. It was to be followed by a group of 50 veterans and serving marines speed marching a half-marathon, before a wreath is laid at the Royal Marines' memorial. </body>

      <description>A woman who died in a sea cave in Dorset was a free school maths teacher and former Royal Navy reservist, it is revealed.</description>

      <body>A woman who died in a sea cave in Dorset was a former Royal Navy reservist whose image was used in promotional material. The parents of 30-year-old Charlotte "Buffy" Furness-Smith confirmed the loss of their daughter to the Evening Standard newspaper. Ms Furness-Smith was a maths teacher at Bristol Free School. Her parents Patricia and Charles Furness-Smith from Buckinghamshire said they were devastated by their loss. In a statement, Ms Furness-Smith's godfather Jon Coles called her "a wonderful girl with an engaging personality and a fabulous friend to all". Mr Coles told the Evening Standard: "She was a dedicated and vivacious teacher who loved the outdoor life." Rescue teams have been unable to find the body of Ms Furness-Smith, who died in a cave at Durlston, near Swanage, a week ago. A companion who had been swimming with her raised the alarm. But gale-force winds and rising tides prevented rescuers reaching her because she had become trapped in the cave. Swanage coastguard search and rescue team said the only ways to reach her were either under water or though a narrow blow hole at the top of the cave. The rescue was considered to be at the "very edge of our technical capability", said a spokesman. Eventually a cliff expert went in through the blowhole showing "exceptional courage", but it was clear Ms Furness-Smith had not survived. The rescuers decided it was too dangerous to try to recover her body at the time and it has not been found since. Dorset Police said they could not identify the woman until a body had been found. </body>

      <title>Labour MSP Helen Eadie dies, aged 66</title>
      <description>Labour MSP Helen Eadie, who was being treated for cancer at a hospice in Dunfermline, dies at the age of 66.</description>

      <body>Labour MSP Helen Eadie has died at the age of 66. It emerged earlier this week that she had cancer and was in a hospice at Queen Margaret Hospital, in Dunfermline. She had been a Labour MSP since the parliament was established in 1999, as the member for Dunfermline East, and later as MSP for Cowdenbeath, following boundary changes. She was diagnosed with her illness at the end of October. She leaves a husband Bob and two daughters. Scottish Labour Leader Johann Lamont said she was deeply saddened to hear of Mrs Eadie's death and described her as a "politician of tremendous passion and commitment". She said: "Helen was very precious to her family. She played an important part in helping to establish the credibility of Holyrood. "She will also be fondly remembered within the Scottish co-operative movement. Her commitment to delivering change in our communities was the essence of her political beliefs and values." "She was her own woman who didn't fit the political stereotype. Perhaps that's why some underestimated her, but her difference was why she was admired by the people of her constituency. "She will be missed by many and will be remembered across her constituency in standing up for their needs and concerns." She added: "My thoughts and those of the whole Scottish Labour movement will be with Helen's family at this difficult time." Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is the MP for Cowdenbeath, described Mrs Eadie as a "passionate champion of social justice". He said: "The whole of Fife is mourning the sudden and very sad death of our popular Member of the Scottish Parliament, Helen Eadie. "Much loved and well respected throughout the county, Helen Eadie has spent her working life serving the people of Fife. "Having spent many years as a Fife councillor Helen became, in 1999, the first member of the Scottish Parliament to be elected for the Dunfermline East and Cowdenbeath constituency, an area which she has represented with great distinction for 14 years." First Minister Alex Salmond said: "My sincere condolences go to Helen Eadie's family, friends and colleagues. Helen served the people she represented diligently over the years, first as a Fife councillor and then as MSP for Dunfermline East and Cowdenbeath. "Helen was also one of the Scottish Parliament's original MSPs first elected in 1999, and that unbroken 14-year period at Holyrood is a not inconsiderable record of public service of which her family can be rightly proud." Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, said: "As fellow parliamentarians for West Fife, Helen's intense, burning commitment to socialism was inspiring to observe. "Although a gentle and kind lady, you did not cross Helen without suffering from the sharp end of her tongue. "Helen made waves for her causes and her constituents." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson MSP said: "Helen was a committed parliamentarian and a true servant to her constituents in Fife. "She was a wonderful, warm-hearted woman who would always go the extra mile to help someone out. "She had friends across all parties, and Scottish politics is poorer for her passing." Former First Minister Henry McLeish, who served with Mrs Eadie on Fife Council in the 1980s, said: "This is a sad loss for Fife. She was always a courageous, defiant and independent advocate for her constituents which is the highest compliment that can be paid to an elected representative." Mrs Eadie recently campaigned in Labour's successful bid to win the Dunfermline by-election. She has a union background and joined Labour in the 1960s, holding a number of posts in the party before life as an elected member beckoned. She served on various Scottish Parliament committees over the years, but in June 2007 resigned her membership of two of them in protest at the Conservatives being given convenership of the equal opportunities committee. At the time Mrs Eadie said the move was like "putting Attila the Hun in charge of care in the community". In November 2006 Mrs Eadie called for curfews for people under the age of 15, after she was trapped in her car by a gang of youngsters. While looking into concerns from constituents about youth-related anti-social behaviour, she was surrounded by a mob in Cowdenbeath who started rocking the car and throwing missiles at it. As a Fife MSP, Mrs Eadie called for an end to tolls on the Forth Road Bridge, during Labour's time in power. In 2003, Mrs Eadie was the Labour group's most outspoken opponent to the then Labour/Lib Dem coalition's plan to introduce proportional representation (PR) in council elections. Voting reform was a key part of the partnership agreement struck between Labour and the Liberal Democrats after the May election, but Mrs Eadie said it was an example of "the tail wagging the dog". She said at the time: "It's about one of the smallest parties in the parliament wanting to use the power that they have to try to force through issues that they want to see steamrollered through." </body>

      <body>A rally has been held in protest at a decision to bring an end to ship-building at BAE's yard at Portsmouth. More than 900 jobs are due to be cut by the firm in the city. About 200 demonstrators, some with placards, gathered in Commercial Road, where they chanted: "Job cuts go away, shipbuilding is here to stay." Louis Macdonald from Portsmouth Trades Council said at the rally: "This is to show that the city is not willing to let the shipbuilding yard be closed." There were 835 further job losses announced by BAE at sites in Glasgow, Rosyth, and Filton. Mr Macdonald said: "There is no need for it. If BAE wish to walk away then let's get another buyer - either domestic or foreign." Penny Mordaunt, the Conservative MP for Portsmouth North, said: "I don't think industrial action or strikes are going to help us get to where we need to be. "We need to send a message to business and also governments and to the Scottish politicians that we are a yard that is open for business." Portsmouth Trades Council media officer Jon Woods said the campaign was being staged to put BAE and the government under pressure to save the shipyard jobs. He said: "I think most of the city is in a state of shock. "We want to ensure that the shipyard stays open and we firmly believe that not a single job should be lost. "There's very short-term thinking going on here - we think we can force them to think again." BAE Systems employs 3,200 people across Govan, Scotstoun, Rosyth and Filton. The company said it had made the cuts because of a "significant" drop in demand. The defence contractor and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have together announced measures that they hope will offset the effect of the job cuts. Among the plans are more than £100m of investment to expand the dockyard at Portsmouth. </body>

      <body>Extreme storms that destroyed footpaths and bridleways across Dartmoor have doubled the cost of the annual repairs for the park authority. Torrential rain left 40 routes in a poor or dangerous condition across the moor. The Dartmoor National Park Authority (DNPA) normally spends almost £50,000 on maintaining almost 450 miles (724km) of paths each year. But, almost £47,000 of extra money was needed following the damage. Head ranger Rob Steemson said the additional funding was "essential". The extra money came from Devon County Council's flood recovery fund after an emergency bid was made following the storms last year. Torrential rain in summer 2012 caused some damage but the floods in November and December resulted in "washed-out paths" across the moor, including at Moretonhampstead, Mary Tavy and Chagford. The Met Office said 2012 was the second wettest year on record in the UK. The total rainfall for the UK was 1,330.mm (52.4in), just 6.6mm short of the record set in 2000. Mr Steemson said about £30,000 of the additional money had been allocated to repairing paths following the December floods. He said: "The biggest challenge now, is finding a suitable 'weather window' when ground conditions will enable contractors to get on site to complete the repairs. "We use local contractors who have been trained by ourselves over the years and they have learnt many traditional skills. "Whatever we do it has to be sympathetic and fit in to the landscape we work in." He added the repairs included resurfacing, cobbling, creating new drainage ditches, restoring hedge banks and walls. Annually, more than two million people visit the national park. </body>

      <body>Police arrested four men suspected of brandishing a gun at tennis star Andy Murray but it has emerged they may have been autograph hunters carrying a tennis racquet. The incident happened in north London on Wednesday when the Scot was in a car with his agent. It is understood two men got out of another car and knocked on Murray's window, but he was driven away. A member of the public thought the men had a gun and contacted police A Scotland Yard spokesman said they received a call at 17:00 on Wednesday to report a sighting of a man with a firearm in a Mercedes car in Avenue Road, Swiss Cottage. The car was stopped in Tadema Road in Chelsea, west London and four men - aged 21, 26, 27 and 31 - were arrested on suspicion of possessing a firearm and taken into custody. They were later bailed until late January pending further inquiries. The spokesman said one line of inquiry being considered was that the men were carrying a tennis racquet. He added: "A search of the car was conducted and no trace of a firearm was found." Murray is currently recovering from back surgery. </body>

      <body>Strictly Come Dancing contestant Natalie Gumede has pulled out of Saturday's live show after fainting twice during rehearsals, the BBC said. The Coronation Street actress, 29, was checked by the medical team on site and would have further medical checks. The BBC said Gumede would be allowed to continue next week but one celebrity would still leave this weekend. Last Saturday, Gumede and partner Artem Chigvintsev, finished four points ahead of their nearest rivals. The pair finished with 38 points from the show's judges four points ahead of Patrick Robinson, Abbey Clancy and Susannah Reid. A BBC spokesman said: "Natalie Gumede will not perform in tonight's Strictly Come Dancing after fainting twice during rehearsals today. "She has been checked by the medical team on site, and will be going to AandE as a precaution." The spokesman said that in accordance with the show's rules, Gumede would still go through to next week's show. At the beginning of the show, host Tess Daly confirmed Gumede had been taken ill and would not be dancing. The soap star, who had been due to perform a jive to Tina Turner's hit Proud Mary, had tweeted earlier on Saturday: "The old bones are tired today." But she added: "Channeling Tina will get me through. Gotta make Mary Proud! #scd". Last week the first 10s of the series were awarded to the actress, best known for portraying Kirsty Soames in Coronation Street, and her partner Artem for their Viennese waltz. Last month, Gumede missed rehearsals for the 19 October show because of an injury. She had an MRI scan to see if she had slipped a disc in her back, but was later given the all-clear. Gumede, from Burnley, is currently one of the favourites to win the dancing competition. Strictly drew its biggest audience of the series so far last week with an average of 10 million tuning in on Saturday - maintaining its lead over ITV rival The X Factor, which drew 7.9 million viewers. </body>

      <description>Former Super League full-back Steve Prescott, who battled a rare form of stomach cancer, dies aged 39.</description>

      <body>Former Super League international Steve Prescott, who battled a rare form of stomach cancer, has died aged 39. Prescott, who played for St Helens, Hull and Wakefield and for England and Ireland, was diagnosed with pseudomyxoma peritonei in 2006. The full-back was given only months to live but battled the disease and in 2009 was awarded an MBE. Prescott also raised thousands of pounds for charity through the Steve Prescott Foundation. Before England's World Cup match against Fiji at the KC Stadium on Saturday, a minute's silence for Prescott turned into a minute's applause before chants of 'There's only one Steve Prescott'. He retired through injury in 2004, after spending a year out of the game with a broken kneecap, and following his diagnosis set up the foundation  in 2007, which has to date raised more than half a million pounds. In 2012 he embarked on a remarkable challenge with former Great Britain international Paul Sculthorpe that consisted of running the Paris Marathon, cycling from Paris to Calais, rowing across the English Channel, cycling from Dover to London and finishing with the London Marathon. It was the third time Prescott had completed the famous London race. Rugby Football League  chairman Nigel Wood said: "Our thoughts are with his family at this terribly sad time. "The word 'hero' is overused in sport but Steve was just that: a role model for every young rugby league player during his distinguished playing career and an absolute inspiration to all of us off the field. "Throughout his long illness Steve was never anything other than dignified, noble and brave, not least during his fantastic charity work through the Steve Prescott Foundation which raised hundreds of thousands of pounds for good causes, including the Rugby League Benevolent Fund. "Steve touched on the lives of a great many people and enriched both rugby league and the whole of sport with his engaging personality, unselfish efforts and his stoicism in the face of such an aggressive and cruel illness. "We are all very fortunate to have been associated with Steve. He is going to be much missed." England Rugby League said on Twitter:  "We are very saddened to hear the news of Steve Prescott who has passed away. You were an inspiration to so many." Former Hull FC star Sean Long said: "RIP Steve Prescott, the words hero and legend are used loosely these days but not in his case! Inspiration, brave, courageous." Olympic boxing gold medallist Luke Campbell said: "RIP to Steve Prescott, legend of a rugby player. Legend of a human being." Craig Murdock, former Hull FC and Hull KR scrum-half and close friend of Prescott, told BBC Radio Humberside: "It's a very sad day. Steve was a great bloke, we knew this day was coming, he's got over so many hurdles, it's a sombre sad day. "It will affect the whole rugby world. Hopefully some of the players out there can put in a performance because he has done so much for the rugby world. "His first thoughts were always for other people and I'm so blessed I can call him my friend. He was such a winner." Ex-Warrington stand-off Lee Briers  - a former team-mate of Prescott at St Helens - said: "Horrible news about Steve Prescott an unbelievable inspiration and friend." St Helens-born Prescott started his professional career with his hometown club and made 117 appearances, scoring 52 tries, in five seasons at Knowsley Road between 1993 and 1997. The full-back scored two tries as Saints beat Bradford to win the 1996 Challenge Cup final and helped them retain the showpiece trophy against the same opposition 12 months later. Prescott left Saints at the end of the 1997 season and had two spells at Hull FC, either side of a season at Wakefield, before suffering his career-ending injury in 2003. After making his international debut with England he transferred nationalities and played for Ireland, qualifying through his grandparents. His father Eric was also a professional rugby league player in the 1970s with St Helens, Widnes and Salford. Prescott is survived by his wife Linzi and two children. </body>

      <title>Star Wars auditions begin in Bristol</title>
      <description>Hundreds of people queue at a Bristol arts centre for the first in a series of open auditions for two lead roles in the next Star Wars film.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of people have been queuing at a Bristol arts centre since the early hours for open auditions for parts in the next Star Wars film. Producer Lucasfilm is seeking two actors for roles in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. The parts are for a "street smart" girl in her late teens and a "smart capable" man in his late teens or early 20s, according to the casting call. Further casting sessions will take place across the UK and Ireland. The auditions, taking place at Bristol's Arnolfini, saw many hopefuls queuing up in the rain from 04:30 GMT onwards. By 10:30 so many people had turned up organisers had to close the line. "This is something I grew up with and it's massive - it's a massive deal," said Ben Millier, from Frome in Somerset. "You can't not audition for this if you're in the age range, if you fit it, because it's just a big deal." Alex Rambo, a hopeful from Bristol, said if there was the "slightest chance - it's all worth it no matter how long you have to queue for". And Tom Millineux, who had also been queuing for several hours, said he "couldn't resist the temptation" despite his "absolute lack of acting experience". But there have been complaints the auditions have been a "complete shambles" with people being turned away after they were told casting had been closed for the day. "My son spent two hours travelling this morning, arrived at 10:30 - at 10:45 they shut the doors," Hayley Mogridge said. "He then waited in line a further two hours in the rain - he is now going to spend his student loan on a cheap hotel for the night to attempt round two." Anna Brown said: "Two young people I know set off to these auditions this morning but were turned away as there were too many people and the queue had been shut down. "Sorry but that is appalling. " Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios near London next spring, with the film due to be released in December 2015. The open auditions for a "major Hollywood movie" were first published on the Twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a "nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie". Lucasfilm has since confirmed the auditions are for the next Star Wars film. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the series, in October 2012 for £2.6bn ($4bn). Open auditions also begin this week in the US, according to an online notice. Casting directors will be visiting cities including Nashville and Chicago as well as accepting online applications. While it is unprecedented for lead parts in a franchise of this size to hold open auditions in this way, Star Wars has in the past given major roles to little-known actors through the traditional casting process. That dates back to the original trilogy, when the then unknown Mark Hamill won the role of Luke Skywalker. Other movies have successfully cast secondary actors and actresses through open auditions in the past, most notably some of the later Harry Potter films. Actress Dakota Blue Richards won the lead role of Lyra in The Golden Compass, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, through open casting. Director JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the new Star Wars movie, will not be attending the open auditions. Instead, those at the auditions, who must be over the age of 16 for the female role, and over 18 for the male role, will briefly meet members of the casting team of the film. Glasgow, Manchester, Dublin and London will host open auditions throughout November.

      <body>Hundreds of people are expected to attend the funeral of a war veteran they never knew after he died with no close friends or relatives around him. Harold Jellicoe Percival helped with the famous Dambusters raids during the Second World War. Mr Percival, who served as ground crew with the RAF's Bomber Command, never married and had no children. The RAF Association has been involved in ensuring that his funeral in Lancashire on Monday is well attended. Mr Percival, who lived in Penge, south London before joining the RAF, died last month aged 99 at a nursing home in Lytham St Annes, Lancashire. Those involved in organising the funeral say they have been contacted by veterans' groups and other military supporters keen to acknowledge Mr Percival's career. Davis Boothman, secretary for the RAF Association Layland branch, said: "We normally do try and make a showing at these times. "It is important that we remember people like Harold - they are part of us." Mr Percival's nephew, David Worsell, who cannot attend the funeral, said: "He was a private man, he worked in Australia for a number of years as a decorator and would visit England for holidays. "He travelled around England with only his backpack. He didn't have a postal address, he just used to get everything sent to my mother's address and would go through it when they met up." After working in Australia, Mr Percival retired to England and lived at the Alistre Lodge Nursing and Care Home in Lytham St Annes. Matron Janet Wareing said: "Harold was a lovely character, very strong-willed and independent. "We have already been contacted by military veterans who are intending to come, even though they have never met him. We've been told one group is looking to bring around 200 people to the service, which would be fantastic." Mr Percival was a distant relative of former British prime minister Spencer Perceval, who was shot dead by a bankrupt broker, John Bellingham, as he entered the House of Commons, in 1812. Mr Percival's great-nephew will represent the family at his funeral service, which takes place at 11:00 GMT on Monday, Armistice Day, at Lytham Park Crematorium. </body>

      <body>Two pipe bombs have been discovered during a security alert in County Antrim. The bombs, which were in a bag, were found by a police patrol in a lay-by on the Belfast Road at Nutts Corner on Friday evening. They were examined by Army bomb disposal experts who made them safe. Both devices have been taken away for further forensic examination and all roads have been reopened. Police have appealed for witnesses to contact them. Alliance Party councillor Alan Lawther said: "I utterly condemn the people who left those bombs there that could have been found by a passerby. "There's plenty of people park on their way to the airport, sit in for a while before going to pick someone up, and they could have come to harm. "Innocent people could have come to harm - it is totally irresponsible behaviour." </body>

      <body>SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell has told his party conference in Armagh people feel let down by the DUP and Sinn Féin. He told delegates the DUP and Sinn Féin "are the parties of disappointment, false promise, poor government, bad politics and no results". "They have had their chance and they have failed the test," Dr McDonnell said. He said SDLP ministers, MLAs and MPs had challenged and faced down the "bad politics" of the DUP and Sinn Féin. "Politics have to deliver results for everybody, particularly ordinary hard-working families," Dr McDonnell said. "I believe that our SDLP core values are central to rebuilding faith in politics, and trust in politicians and delivering worthwhile benefits. "Those core values are: Reconciliation, social justice and prosperity. "The many broken promises in the programme for government show the disappointing failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin, including the failure to get to grips with a shared future, collusion issues, real power sharing and integration." The SDLP leader said for much of the past year "riots and mayhem" had dominated the headlines in Northern Ireland. "Hundreds of courageous PSNI officers; holding the line, have been injured, the police have been stretched to breaking point and the economy of Belfast has been severely damaged," he said. "Last December, Belfast City Council arrived at a sensible compromise, to fly the union flag on designated days, a decision that was supported by the SDLP. "It is unfortunate that unionists cannot do compromise." He said the party believed Northern Ireland needed a formal prosperity process, pursued with the same ambition and determination as the peace process. "Indeed 15 years ago many of us expected a prosperity process; a mini Marshall Plan; to be constructed to underpin the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement," he said. "There were promises - hopes were raised; and hopes were dashed." Dr McDonnell concluded his speech by saying that he had a dream for the future of Ireland. "I have a dream of a new and much better Ireland where our vision and all our hopes and ambitions for peace, reconciliation, social justice and economic prosperity are finally realised; a new Ireland taking her place proudly in a brave new world at the heart of Europe and where we are at peace with ourselves and with Britain," he said. "We in the SDLP are determined to ensure that we empower you to realise your dreams, hopes and ambitions both for yourselves and for your families." </body>

      <body>Firefighters remain at the scene of a Vale of Glamorgan recycling plant four days after it was devastated by a large blaze. At its height, 45 firefighters tackled the incident at Siteserv, Llandow Industrial Estate, near Cowbridge, which started on Tuesday at 19:20 GMT. Now, crews are removing refuse and continuing to damp down the site, said South Wales Fire and Rescue Service. It is thought they could remain at the scene for about a week. Siteserv, which employs around 200 people, was set up more than 16 years ago by brothers Nigel and Philip England. Earlier this week the company said it was working with investigators to help identify the cause of the fire. The fire involved about 1,000 tonnes of mixed household waste. Crews using two fire engines and a specialist aerial ladder are working at the site. </body>

      <body>Lumps of "rancid" fat have washed up on several more beaches along the south Wales coast, say environmental experts. Natural Resources Wales (NRW) issued a warning on Friday after deposits were spotted at Ogmore, Vale of Glamorgan. Officials now say more samples have been reported at neighbouring Southerndown as well as Newton near Porthcawl, and Oxwich and Llangennith on the Gower. Dog owners are advised to keep pets away as it could pose a risk. NRW said several animals had fallen ill after eating the fat, believed to be rancid, degraded vegetable oil. Samples have been taken away for analysis but experts say the fat is likely to be related to several incidents along the south west coast of England over the last month. "Dog owners are advised to be extra vigilant as their pets are particularly attracted to this type of waste," said an NRW spokesperson. The fat is not thought to be harmful to children unless eaten. Vale of Glamorgan council said on Friday that environmental health officers were investigating the first incident at Ogmore. The council's waste management team will inspect and clear the coastline in Ogmore daily until the white substance stops appearing. </body>

      <body>A fisherman died in hospital after he was seriously injured at a marina on the River Tyne. He had fallen and become trapped between the quay wall and a fishing vessel at Royal Quays, North Shields, just before midnight. An RNLI lifeboat crew recovered him from the water and he was treated at the scene by paramedics. He has not yet been named, but is thought to be the skipper of a trawler from the port of Fraserburgh. Northumbria Police said in a statement: "At 1am this morning police were informed that a man had fallen from a boat into the River Tyne. "He was taken to hospital where he subsequently died. "The Maritime Investigation Board will be carrying out an inquiry into the incident." Adrian Don, spokesman for Tynemouth RNLI lifeboat station, said the victim had been in the water for "some time" when he was rescued. He said: "Once on the scene, a volunteer RNLI crew member swam between the dock wall and the trawler where the man was trapped and got him closer to the lifeboat into which he was recovered. "He was then passed into the care of paramedics who took him to hospital." </body>

      <body>Thousands of leaflets were handed out at Liverpool's home game against Fulham appealing to fans to help with the probe into police actions in the Hillsborough disaster. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is urging witnesses to the 1989 tragedy to contact them. Ninety-six Liverpool fans died as a result of the crush. The IPCC said 1,400 witnesses had so far responded, but believed some fans may not know about the witness appeal. Supporters' group Spirit of Shankly gave out leaflets at pubs and outside the turnstiles and Liverpool FC distributed flyers as well as displaying posters publicising the appeal at Anfield. Ian Christon from the IPCC said: "We have had a very good response to the appeal so far, but we have heard there are some people who might not be internet savvy and who are not aware of the appeal. "We are encouraging anybody who has an account to give to come forward. "You might just give that little snippet of information that might make a difference... and it might be a key piece of evidence." The IPCC's investigation follows the report by the Hillsborough Independent Panel published last September, which concluded the lives of 41 fans could have been saved and cleared Liverpool supporters of any wrongdoing. It found South Yorkshire Police had altered 164 statements and tried to blame fans. In the aftermath of the disaster West Midlands Police was appointed to gather evidence on the original investigation for subsequent inquiries and inquests. The police watchdog revealed there were "differences" between fans' statements and questionnaires they returned to the West Midlands Police inquiry. The IPCC said it has uncovered an additional 74 police statements which had been altered.

      <body>A Range Rover stolen from an Olympic athlete while he attended his mother's funeral has been located. Hurdler Andy Turner, 33, also had his mobile phone containing photos of his mother taken in a burglary at his home in Hucknall, Nottingham, on Thursday. His vehicle has been found in Bilborough, Nottinghamshire Police said. The athlete tweeted he had "no idea the damage or what's still in there but I won't hold my breath". "I am feeling a little bit better because they have got the car back - and I am hoping for the best," he said. The Nottinghamshire-born athlete is offering a £500 reward for the return of his laptop and mobile phone. Officers are investigating whether the raiders targeted the hurdler's family home after he posted details of his mother's funeral on Twitter and have appealed for anyone with information to contact them. Yvonne Turner, 58, died suddenly on 29 October. Nottinghamshire Police said the Ranger Rover was being forensically examined and that a number of items, including a laptop, were still missing. Turner is the third fastest British sprint hurdler behind Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett and won gold medals at both the Commonwealth Games and European Athletics Championships in 2010. He also took bronze in the 110 metres hurdles at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu. </body>

      <body>England scored six tries in 18 minutes as they recovered from 6-0 down to comfortably beat Fiji and claim a place in the last eight of the World Cup. Eloni Vunakece had put Fiji ahead in a brutal first half at the KC Stadium but Ben Westwood levelled before the break. Sam Burgess scored seconds after the restart as England put in a much-improved attacking performance. Two scores from Ryan Hall plus tries from Brett Ferres and Rob Burrow sealed victory before Semi Radradra scored. Steve McNamara's team were playing their final Group A match and, unless something truly extraordinary happens when unbeaten Australia play winless Ireland this evening, will meet either France or Samoa in their quarter-final. That match will take place in Wigan next Saturday as England look to secure a spot in the last four and, if results go to form, a match against reigning champions New Zealand. The day had started on a sad note when the players were told that former England international Steve Prescott had died following a long battle against cancer. Before the match a minute's silence spontaneously changed into a poignant and moving minute's applause, and after the final hooter the England players joined Fiji for their traditional post-match prayer in another touching gesture. England expected a tough, physical battle and they certainly got one in the opening half, with front rower Ashton Sims setting the tone for Fiji with a series of in-your-face crunching tackles. Ashton, one of three Sims brothers in the Fiji starting XIII in addition to Ryan and Daryl Millard and Kevin and Wes Naiqama, pulled off a great try-saving tackle when he dislodged the ball from Sam Burgess as the England forward dived over the line. Both teams tore into each other in front of 25,114 inside the KC Stadium, with Korbin Sims put on report for a dangerous dump-tackle on prop James Graham. Graham responded with several physical tackles of his own, seizing upon every opportunity to charge into Korbin. England dominated possession but could not conjure up the decisive play at the end of their sets and they were almost punished when Sam Tomkins failed to clear a kick from Ryan Millard that brother Daryl eventually touched down. Video referee Shayne Hayne spent a long time analysing the replays before deciding that Tomkins had been taken out off the ball by Tariq Sims as he tried to make amends for his botched clearance. But Fiji's endeavours were rewarded when the pugnacious Tariq Sims burst through a hole in the England defensive line after collecting a flat pass from Ryan Millard before laying on a simple finish for Vunakece. That score came just after the half-hour mark and created an atmosphere of mild panic inside the stadium, but England were level at the break after Sinfield's clever dummy created the opening for Westwood, who was placed on report towards the end of the match, to touch down. And England led for the first time within a minute of the restart when man of the match Sam Burgess charged over, taking several Fiji players with him. Seconds earlier Burgess had gathered the ball straight from Sinfield's short restart that the Fijians had allowed to bounce. From that moment England did not look back, as they found the attacking cohesion they lacked in crucial areas during most of the opening 40 minutes. Minutes after Burgess's try, England had a six-point cushion as Chris Hill and Rangi Chase combined to send Brett Ferres through. And when the video referee ruled that Hall's left foot had not made contact with the whitewash as he raced down the right touchline, the match was effectively over as a contest. England moved 30-6 ahead when a move involving Sinfield, Hill and George Burgess was finished by the impressive Burrow, who was making his first appearance of the tournament. Hall was the next to score as England turned on the style, profiting from the space created by a curved run from Tomkins. That made it 34-6 after Sinfield missed the conversion, and although England threatened the Fiji line several more times the final score belonged to winger Radradra, who touched down in the corner. England coach Steve McNamara: "It was a proper Test match and anyone who thought we would walk over the Fijians were wrong. "It was tough, especially in the first half, and was exactly the type of test we needed. "We have had to work hard in every game and that will bode well for the quarter-finals. I'm pretty pleased." England: Tomkins, Briscoe, Watkins, Cudjoe, Hall, Chase, Sinfield, S. Burgess, McIlorum, Graham, Ferres, Westwood, O'Loughlin. Replacements: Burrow, Farrell, Hill, G. Burgess. Fiji: K. Naiqama, Koroibete, D. Millard, W. Naiqama, Waqavatu, R. Millard, Groom, A. Sims, Storer, Civoniceva, Bukuya, T. Sims, K. Sims. Replacements : Vunakece, Botiki, Roqica, Evans.

      <body>Eden Hazard's controversial stoppage-time penalty salvaged a draw for Chelsea against West Brom and kept Jose Mourinho's unbeaten home record intact. Hazard maintained his composure to score after Steven Reid had been penalised for a collision with Ramires, who appeared to go to ground easily. The hosts took a half-time lead when Samuel Eto'o pounced from close range. But the Baggies fought back superbly through Shane Long and Stephane Sessegnon before the late drama. The penalty was awarded by referee Andre Marriner in the fourth and final minute of stoppage-time for what appeared a relatively innocuous coming-together between Ramires and Reid. And after Hazard had sent the impressive Boaz Myhill the wrong way, there was a fracas between the rival players as West Brom made their anger clear. But if it was a cruel ending for the visitors, who were seconds away from their first victory over Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in 30 years, it was a redemption of sorts for Hazard. The Belgian had been restored to the starting line-up after being dropped in midweek for arriving back late from a trip to watch his former club Lille. And he justified his manager's faith with an energetic performance and a nerveless spot-kick that extended Mourinho's run of home Premier League matches without defeat to 66. A victory for the Baggies would have represented a coup for their manager Steve Clarke, who was Mourinho's assistant during his hugely successful first stint at the club. And the Scot's well-drilled outfit looked comfortable as they kept Chelsea at bay for almost the entirety of an uneventful first half. However, just when the Blues fans were starting to give voice to their frustrations at a stuttering display, the opening goal arrived. When Myhill parried Hazard's fierce shot from the left, Eto'o punished a dithering Liam Ridgewell at the far post to poke home his fourth goal for the club. Chelsea went up a gear at the start of the second half and Hazard fluffed a chance to double Chelsea's lead when he failed to control an exquisite long pass from Oscar. The one-way traffic was reversed when West Brom almost snatched an equaliser on the break. An accurate cross from Morgan Amalfitano located Long, whose powerful header from the penalty spot struck the foot of the post. If the opportunity was a warning to Chelsea of Long's aerial prowess, it went unheeded. Further Albion pressure earned a corner from the right and when Gareth McAuley's header was pushed into the air by keeper Petr Cech, Long leapt above a crowd of Chelsea players to nod home. Amazingly, there was more to come from the visitors. Sensing vulnerability in their illustrious opponents, West Brom poured forward and were rewarded with a second goal. Ridgewell picked out Sessegnon, who side-stepped John Terry and cracked off a shot which somehow squirmed under the body of a flat-footed Cech. Chelsea responded with a characteristic onslaught, but Myhill showed excellent reflexes to turn aside a low drive from Ivanovic before William headed over. The Blues remained vulnerable though and almost suffered a fatal wound when Chris Brunt ran from inside his own half but could only shoot over with team-mates well placed. However, with Chelsea fans streaming towards the exits, the Blues were handed a last-gasp opportunity to claim a point. Running at pace with the ball inside the area, Ramires appeared to lean into Reid before hitting the ground. The collision was enough to convince Marriner to point to the spot, and Hazard stepped up to secure a vital point for the London team. </body>

      <description>A ruthless Liverpool thrash Fulham at Anfield, with an own-goal, a Martin Skrtel header and a Luis Suarez brace.</description>

      <body>Liverpool produced another ruthless display at Anfield to overwhelm Fulham and leave manager Martin Jol facing more questions about his future. Luis Suarez, once again, provided the spark for Liverpool as he scored his seventh and eighth goals of the season to lift the Anfield club into second place in the Premier League table, two points behind leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand. Fulham were never in this from the moment Brendan Rodgers's side took a first-half lead thanks to an own goal by Fernando Amorebieta. Martin Skrtel's thumping header doubled the lead and Suarez fired in the first of his two goals before half-time. The Uruguayan added Liverpool's fourth with a rising shot 10 minutes into the second half, to leave Fulham fans streaming for the exits with their side just two points above the relegation zone after a third straight defeat. Jol says he does not fear the sack but this result will only increase the speculation regarding his future. Just when Fulham needed pace, purpose and passion, his side produced a performance that lacked all of those qualities. They were insipid, not inventive. It could have been far worse. That it wasn't owed much to Fulham goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, who denied Liverpool certain goals on at least three occasions. This was, of course, never going to be an easy task for Jol's side. Fulham have won just once in 33 visits to Anfield. Actor Mike Myers, of Austin Powers and Wayne's World fame, watched on from the second row of the directors' box as his beloved Liverpool produced a command performance of their own. Jol will not have seen the funny side. Liverpool's starring cast lead the way, with Philippe Coutinho instrumental and Steven Gerrard tremendous throughout. This was a truly decisive response to a 2-0 defeat by Arsenal last Saturday. Liverpool have now scored 16 goals in six league games since Suarez returned from a 10-game suspension, with the Uruguayan and Daniel Sturridge grabbing 12 of them - more than the Fulham team combined have scored this season. Dimitar Berbatov was, once again, a peripheral figure, isolated and alone as the target man. Steve Sidwell and Scott Parker fought hard but were off the pace throughout. The visitors had held firm until the 26th minute. But once the floodgates opened, there was an inevitability about the outcome. Liverpool's opener owed much to fortune as Amorebieta inadvertently headed beyond his goalkeeper. Gerrard's excellent free-kick had been headed on by Suarez only for the ball to deflect off Daniel Agger and then Amorebieta on its way in. Three minutes later, Liverpool went further ahead with Amorebieta at fault once more. Skrtel lost the Fulham defender all too easily and found space to guide Gerrard's pin-point corner beyond Stekelenburg with a thumping header. Liverpool added a third before half-time. This time Suarez finished a flowing move that began with Gerrard and featured a slide-rule pass from Henderson. The Uruguayan looked up and fired the ball low beyond the Fulham goalkeeper in one fluid movement. The Reds might have had two more within three minutes of the restart, but they did not have to wait long for their fourth as Fulham threatened to fall apart. Gerrard burst forward and played another delightfully weighted pass through to Suarez, the striker considered squaring it before unleashing a thumping shot that flashed beyond Stekelenburg and into the net. With the contest over, the game fizzled out during the final 30 minutes with referee Mike Jones waving away Henderson's claims for a penalty. It mattered not to Liverpool but Fulham left Anfield with much to ponder. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: "Our appetite for the game was outstanding. Luis Suarez is a star talent but his core ingredient is his workrate, which is something we're trying to have throughout the team. "He covers and presses and is a good talisman. Our quality was very good. At half-time I said I wanted us to be relentless, to keep pushing. "But our intensity was outstanding after the first whistle. We saw today as a very important game, and we made an excellent start. Home games are important, so it was a good victory for us."

      <title>How strong is anti-Semitism in Germany?</title>
      <description>Seventy five years after Kristallnacht - the night of violence against Jews in Germany which ended in mass murder - how strong is anti-Semitism in Germany?</description>

      <body>It's 75 years since the pogroms that became known as Kristallnacht - the night of broken glass. It was the outbreak of mass violence against Jews which was to end in their mass murder. As the anniversary is marked, how strong - or weak - is anti-Semitism in Germany today? Ruth Recknagel remembers the feral looting. Even today, 75 years later, she recalls people swarming around the broken windows of Jewish shops in Berlin and then snatching what they could. Ruth was born in 1930, so on 9 November 1938 she was only eight years old. She walked around the shattered glass at Potsdamer Platz with her Jewish father. What she witnessed remains imprinted on her mind. "It was a decisive break," she says. "It was the start. From then on, everything got worse." Others remembered the way the pogroms unfolded into an organised orgy of violence. There was unrestrained grabbing from shops as well as attacks on schools and even hospitals. The Daily Telegraph correspondent in Berlin at the time, Michael Bruce, recounted "one of the foulest exhibitions of bestiality" he had ever witnessed when rioters broke into a hospital for sick Jewish children. Tiny children were being chased "over the broken glass, bare-footed and wearing nothing but their nightshirts," Bruce wrote. "The nurses, doctors, and attendants were being kicked and beaten by the mob leaders, most of whom were women." The November pogroms marked the start of the Holocaust. After it, the gloves were truly off. Jews had been persecuted from 1933 - barred from ever more jobs, routinely insulted and attacked. But Kristallnacht was the step-change in escalation. Any pretence and restraint vanished. The shattered glass of Kristallnacht led to the death camps. And that is not forgotten in Germany today. It is taught in schools and remembered from podiums occupied by the chancellor of Germany down. But how much anti-Semitism lingers despite the knowledge of what happened? It is a complex picture. There is, for example, a growing Jewish population in Germany. It is small at less than 1% of the total population (and much smaller than the 5% of the population with a Turkish background, for example). But it is a community which is growing rapidly, and people don't tend to migrate to a more hostile environment than the one they left. The Israeli embassy in Berlin estimates that there are about 10,000 Israelis in Berlin alone, many of them drawn by the cultural life. The city abounds with Israeli sculptors, painters and musicians who often say they have found a home conducive to artistic creation. There is, though, sometimes resentment from other Jews. I've been in a meeting where a visiting American-Jewish author rounded on the Israelis there who had moved to Germany to live and work. How could they look at themselves in the mirror, the angry author taunted the Israeli immigrants to Germany. Jews in Germany often say, though, that they find much more anti-Semitism when they go abroad. One person told the BBC she had experienced far worse prejudice in Britain than she had at home in Germany - in a Cambridge college, ham was sometimes placed in her postbox. The widely accepted research into attitudes to race across Europe was done by the University of Bielefeld. It teased out deeper attitudes by asking indirect questions about, for example, whether respondents thought Jews "have too much influence" or "try to take advantage of past persecution". The study, published in 2011, and based on thousands of interviews done in 2008, concluded: "The significantly strongest agreement with anti-Semitic prejudices is found in Poland and Hungary. In Portugal, followed closely by Germany, anti-Semitism is significantly more prominent than in the other western European countries. In Italy and France, anti-Semitic attitudes as a whole are less widespread than the European average, while the extent of anti-Semitism is least in Great Britain and the Netherlands". In all the countries studied apart from Italy, a majority answered that "Jews enrich our culture". In Germany, nearly 70% said so, about the same as in Britain. But nearly half of German respondents said that "Jews try to take advantage of having been victims during the Nazi era". That's compared to 22% for Britain, 32% for France, 40% for Italy, 68% for Hungary and 72% for Poland. A separate study published by the German parliament in 2012 concluded that 20% of Germans held at least "latent anti-Semitism" - some sort of quiet, unspoken antipathy towards Jews. Rabbis often praise the German government for its outspoken condemnation of anti-Semitism. "Germany is certainly doing a lot to fight anti-Semitism," says Prof Walter Homolka, the director of Abraham Geiger College at the University of Potsdam. "Whether it is ever going to be enough, that's a big question. We can only hope to keep this figure of 20% in check." He says the public statements and the presence of people such as Chancellor Angela Merkel at big Jewish events is important as a signal to the rest of the population. Chancellor Merkel has said that an attack on Jews is an attack on everyone. What does seem to be clear is that anti-Semitism is rising in Germany. "Anti-Semitism is acceptable again," says Anetta Kahane director of the Amadeu Antonio Foundation, which campaigns against racism. "It must be said clearly - those who say something anti-Semitic tacitly legitimise physical attacks on Jews." The foundation has collated official figures which say that in 2011, there were 811 attacks on Jews. These were of various degrees of intimidation, from verbal attacks to physical assault, and included 16 violent attacks. In 2012, that rose to 865 attacks in total, with 27 of them being violent. In the first half of this year, the rise seems to have continued, with 409 attacks, 16 of them violent. A year ago, Rabbi Daniel Alter was attacked by a group of youths of Middle Eastern appearance as he walked with his young daughter. "They made threats of violence against female members of my family, including my seven-year-old daughter who was by my side," he says. One man confronted him very aggressively before striking him: "With his first hit he broke my cheek bone. There was another man hitting me from behind, hitting me either with his fist or something else on my head, and I fell to the floor. The next thing is I saw them running away." It has made him change his life. Seventy-five years after Kristallnacht, he feels he can no longer wear his skullcap openly in some areas of Berlin, and covers it with a hat. And he has re-doubled his efforts to visit schools and talk to children - often alongside an Imam from a mosque. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>JFK and the rise of conspiracy theories</title>

      <body>With the 50th anniversary of John F Kennedy's assassination approaching, Will Self wonders if this was when Westerners started to distrust official accounts. In Dealey Plaza the light quality was dun-to-sepia and the jackhammers of the highways department drumming on the sainted tarmac seemed to presage some terrible event yet to happen. Near to the workmen were two white crosses painted on the tarmac. Pointing them out to me, a ragged and quite possibly homeless man explained that the first marked the spot the president's motorcade had reached when the first of the assassin's bullets hit, while the second cross marked the entry point of the second bullet. Another destitute man who was sauntering past snarled out of the corner of his mouth: "Don't listen to him, he's working for the government." I resisted the urge to quip, "Well, if he is they certainly aren't paying him enough," because, standing on the grassy knoll, within yards of where John F Kennedy met his end, and within days of the half-centenary of this momentous event, levity hardly felt appropriate. But then this begged the question - what is the appropriate way to commemorate a political assassination? Taken as a collectivity - which, after all, is often how Americans wish to be considered - their response to this conundrum has been curiously muted. On the evening of the day I explored Dealey Plaza and its environs I spoke with an academic at a local college who - like so many others - vividly remembered that day in November 1963. A child growing up in a mixed Irish and Mexican-American, North Dallas blue-collar neighbourhood, she recalled the people coming out of their houses to stand, many weeping uncontrollably, in their front yards. "In their homes," she told me, "they would have two iconic portraits. Images painted in profile, in garish oils on black velvet backgrounds. One would be of the pope, the other of Kennedy." The years, and now the decades of lubricious revelations have tarnished John F Kennedy's once coruscating lustre, and standing in the overcast plaza I couldn't help but see a parallel between this and the way the prospect before me - such a cramped, workaday urban space - contrasted with the mythic realm depicted by Benjamin Zapruder's infamous film of the assassination. Zapruder's footage became emblematic of the growing mediatisation of public events in the 1960s. A decade that began with disasters still happening in far away countries of which we knew very little and saw virtually nothing, ended with the emaciated stick-figure victims of the Biafran War lolling listlessly on our television screens, intercut with near-live film of US Army helicopters strafing North Vietnamese villages with heavy-calibre machine guns. Kennedy's assassination was the epitome of this new phenomenon, fitting as it did celebrity, glamour, tragedy, bloodshed, sex and power within the compass of a single lens. And then there were the conspiracy theories. In back of the knoll itself - which is actually a crescent-shaped verge of modest proportions - I found local historian Mark Oakes beside his rather permanent-looking stall. A tall, well-preserved man, with a full head of dark hair, cut Kennedy-like en brosse, Oakes had, he told me, become fixated when in 1971, still a high school senior, he had read right through the many fat volumes of the Warren Commission's report into the assassination. Forty-two years later, he shows the Zapruder film on a portable DVD player along with clips of his own TV appearances. He also has an array of books and pamphlets available and, without any soliciting on my part, he quickly offered to sell me copies of the president's autopsy photographs "autographed" - as he put it - by one of the technicians who had assisted. Yet the surprise for me wasn't this macabre obsessiveness but Oakes's response when I asked him, "Come on then, who did it?" Because instead of coming out with one or other of the myriad conspiracy theories that have rooted over the years in the psychic mulch formed by so much tortured regard, he instead shrugged his shoulders and replied, "I dunno, there are so many possible candidates: the mob, the CIA, the Teamsters - you can take your pick." When I taxed him: "But you do believe there was a conspiracy, don't you?", he continued, "I would say a cover-up, definitely - but I don't know about a conspiracy." In fact, as we continued talking, it became clear that Oakfield's main evidence for the assumption that the real character of this momentous event had been wilfully obscured was his own disbarment from its mediatisation. "They never have me on NBC or any of the other major networks," he said, his rich baritone rising slightly into moan. Heading into the former Texas School Book Depository, which now houses, in the very place from which those shots were allegedly fired (its sixth floor), a museum dedicated to the assassination, I reflected on how it was that Oakfield personified the relationship between the individual and history in the era of mass media. Both conspiracy and cover-up are nostrums designed to reassure us that our feelings of powerlessness and irrelevance are justified. How can we be expected to do anything about these dreadful things that are happening right in front of our eyes if they simultaneously lie to us and refuse to let us have our say? The museum was muted and tasteful. We had been warned by the youth at the ticket desk not to take any photographs. What Oswald may - or may not - have seen through his rifle sights has now been copyrighted by the Associated Press. Naturally, I ignored this. As for the window from which Oswald just might have shot the white hope of American democracy, from an adjacent one I looked down at the white crosses in the roadway at a steep angle through tree foliage. For a historic distance it seemed a small one - a model of the trajectory rather than the trajectory itself. The actual window had been glassed off and transformed into a tableau mordant of how it might have looked 50 years ago, complete with repositories of musty school text books. Walking across downtown Dallas I mulled over with my two companions - both American, one a native Texan - the strange sense I had that the museum had done its job. Even the Jackie Kennedy replica pearls in the gift shop and the ashtrays inscribed "Carpe Diem" played their part, for in commodification - this being America - there was also a certain historicity. The assassination, I said, now seems to belong definitively to the past, rather than to some Zapruder film-loop of the permanent present. Mike, the Texan, said he thought that this might be true, and instanced the fact that the man who once plied a trade driving tourists around the plaza in an open-topped Lincoln limousine, seemed to have hung up his ignition key. "When he drove over the Xs, a tape recorder in the car played realistic rifle shot effects," Mike said. Fifty is a lot of years, and before the elongation of western lifespans would have been accorded a couple of generations. Belying Oakes's youthful appearance, the fact remains that what's been covered up for him is not what's been hidden from contemporary Americans. In a year that saw the exposure of the National Security Agency's tentacular sucker-prints all over the VDUs of the wired world, the half-century-old arguments about whether the camera ever lied begin to seem hopelessly recondite. It isn't so much, I think, that the Kennedy assassination has transitioned smoothly into a commonsensical past. It's rather that it is the first instance of a peculiarly modern variant of the historic event - its media simulation. Since that November day in Dealey Plaza, the generality of Westerners have ceased, in an important way, to lend credence to the effusions of the media. Far from believing that the camera never lies, we suspect that like our political leaders, it always does. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>An influential committee of MPs has asked the Bank of England to clarify its role in policing the Help to Buy scheme amid fears of a property bubble. The Treasury Select Committee said that the "scope and limits" of the Bank's role were not clear. In September, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank to take a bigger role in ensuring the Help to Buy scheme did not fuel a property boom. Help to Buy is aimed at helping first-time buyers get on the property ladder. The government said it would assist those who could afford the regular mortgage repayments, but who were unable to raise a large deposit required by many lenders. The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit. Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales. Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan. A host of big mortgage lenders have started, or promised to offer, new products under the scheme, although the UK's biggest building society - the Nationwide - has not decided on whether it will sign up. Critics have suggested that these products would fuel an artificial housing bubble and expressed concerns about how it will be brought to an end, prompting the chancellor to ask the Bank to keep a close eye on it. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee is able to modify parts of the Help to Buy scheme to keep it in check. It can reduce the £600,000 cap on properties under the scheme, so that fewer homes are affected. It can also also make loans less attractive by recommending that the Treasury raises the fees paid by lenders for the guarantees. The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, has now written to the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, asking him to outline the Bank's role and how it would keep itself detached from government policy on the scheme. "The scope and limits of the Bank's role in this scheme need a good deal of clarification, both to safeguard the Bank's authority to act in fulfilment of its statutory responsibility for financial stability and to safeguard its independence," he said. </body>

      <title>Guardian to face MPs over NSA leaks</title>

      <body>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger is to be questioned by MPs over the newspaper's publication of leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden. Mr Rusbridger will give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee next month, a Guardian spokesman confirmed. The Guardian has published information about how British and US spy agencies monitor communications. The decision to publish the leaks was criticised by the leaders of UK security services on Thursday. Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought asylum - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. MI6 chief Sir John Sawers warned the Intelligence and Security Committee earlier this week that "our adversaries were rubbing their hands with glee, al-Qaeda is lapping it up" in the wake of the Snowden revelations, adding: "The leaks from Snowden have been very damaging, they've put our operations at risk". The Guardian, though, has defended its decision to publish the information, saying that the paper's coverage of British and US surveillance had prompted "necessary debate". On Friday, a spokesman said: "Alan has been invited to give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee and looks forward to appearing next month." Mr Sawers, along with the head of MI5 Andrew Parker and GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, were questioned by MPs in public after coming under pressure to be more open after the leaks by Mr Snowden revealed widespread spying by GCHQ and the US National Security Agency. Mr Parker argued that the security services defend, rather than undermine freedom, and pointed to 34 terror plots that had been disrupted by the security services since the terror attacks in London on 7 July 2005. News of Mr Rusbridger's appearance before the committee comes as Conservative MPs Julian Smith and Stephen Phillips called on him to clarify whether he had "acted on every security concern raised by government" over the news stories. They also asked him to confirm whether anyone at the Guardian had "directed, permitted, facilitated or acquiesced" in the transfer of the files obtained by Mr Snowden to anyone in the US or elsewhere. Mr Smith and Mr Phillips said Mr Rusbridger's response to a letter from 28 Tory MPs had failed to "acknowledge the devastating assessment of the damage done to the national security of the United Kingdom by the Guardian's reporting of the Snowden leaks", citing the evidence given by the security chiefs. They continued: "Secondly, it fails to address the question of whether you have acted on every security concern raised by government and whether the Government has felt that it had adequate time to respond to the matters which you have reported." </body>

      <title>Tory MPs rally behind EU vote plan</title>
      <description>Conservative MPs rally behind a bill promising an EU referendum by 2017 as Labour MPs try to derail it during a five-hour debate in the Commons.</description>

      <body>Conservative MPs have rallied behind a bill promising an EU referendum in the face of Labour attempts to derail it. Legislation urging a referendum by 2017 was discussed for five hours but no major votes were held and the debate was adjourned until later this month. Deputy PM Nick Clegg later criticised the Tories for "flirting" with an EU exit, while Labour MPs sought to delay the bill's passage through the Commons. But its sponsor, Tory MP James Wharton, said it had made "reasonable progress". The first in three days of detailed debate on Mr Wharton's bill concluded with Conservatives and Labour arguing over parliamentary tactics. In an effort to slow its progress, Labour MPs raised a host of related issues at length, including whether residents of Gibraltar and prisoners should be able to vote in a future referendum. Mr Cameron's referendum pledge, following a renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels, cannot be made law in the form of a coalition government bill because of Lib Dem opposition. "I think the Conservative Party is wrong to be flirting with exit from the European Union," Mr Clegg told the BBC. "Hundreds of thousands, millions of jobs depend on our place in what is the world's largest borderless single market." Tory backbencher Mr Wharton agreed to propose the legislation after he came top in a ballot of MPs private members' bill and many Tories pushed for the referendum commitment to be made binding before the 2015 general election. The bill has now reached its "report stage", where amendments can be discussed in detail. More than 50 amendments have been tabled, including 36 alone by Labour's Mike Gapes. Mr Gapes, who spoke for about an hour, defended his approach, saying the bill as it stood was "inadequate" and required "more proper consideration". His colleague Barry Sheerman said it was "furtive and unseemly" to have such an important constitutional matter considered via a private member's bill rather than through government legislation. And Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was not present for the debate, said the bill was an exercise in the "Conservative Party talking to itself". Mr Wharton told the BBC's Daily Politics his bill was making "reasonable progress" but acknowledged it was "going to be slow going". He said Labour and Lib Dem opponents wanted to delay the bill so it ran out of parliamentary time, adding: "We are going to do everything we can to stop that from happening". However, Conservative MP Adam Afriyie, has tabled an amendment calling for the referendum to happen in October next year instead - arguing that delaying a vote for four years will play into the hands of the UK Independence Party. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Afriyie likened the promise of a referendum to a "can that has been kicked down the road for generation after generation" and urged MPs to "settle the question now". "I ask a simple question," he said. "If not in this Parliament, when else can we be sure of securing a referendum...By chasing the EU referendum dream in 2017, we risk losing one in 2014 and throwing away the 2015 election." Asked about Mr Afriyie's amendment, Mr Wharton said: "One Conservative MP has said 'I think perhaps we should look at a different date' and what we have found in recent months is that there is not a lot of support for that." Private members' bills normally have little chance of becoming law due to lack of parliamentary time, unless they are backed by the government. But Mr Wharton's bill is being treated differently because David Cameron wants it to become law, to send a signal to his MPs and the public that he is serious about his commitment to hold a referendum. Tory MPs are under a "three line whip" to support the bill but few are speaking in Friday's debate amid concerns that this would limit the time for discussion and play into the hands of the bill's opponents. Foreign Secretary William Hague has written to all Conservatives to urge them to make their remarks "short and pithy". If it looks like the legislation will be "talked out" by opponents giving long speeches, Mr Wharton can ask for a "closure motion". If backed by a majority of MPs, numbering at least 100, this would allow the bill to be voted on as a whole. Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said Parliament was "only doing its job" by scrutinising the legislation, pointing out that the status of Gibraltar was highly significant and its omission from the bill was first raised by a Conservative. However, he acknowledged that opponents of the bill would not do themselves any favours by tabling "frivolous" amendments and Parliament must focus on the substance of the benefits of UK membership. UKIP, which has no representation in the Commons, urged MPs to back Mr Afriyie's call for the referendum to be brought forward. "I hope MPs do what's right, by voting to give the British people a say on the EU as soon as possible," the party's leader Nigel Farage said. If it makes it through the Commons, it will go to the Lords for further discussion in the next few months. </body>

      <title>Secret army against Nazi invasion</title>
      <description>The volunteers trained to fight in the event of a German invasion</description>

      <body>This Sunday, people across Britain will remember those who sacrificed their lives for the country in World War Two. And it will be a particularly poignant day for Winston Churchill's "secret army", who will be parading at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday for the first time. It was 1940, much of Europe had fallen to the Nazis and an invasion of Britain seemed imminent. Churchill called it the nation's "darkest hour" and for one Cornish teenager it was the beginning of a great adventure. Trevor Miners, 86, from Perranporth, was part of Churchill's Auxiliary Units, a volunteer force trained to be the underground line of defence in the event of a German invasion. Mr Miners was a 16-year-old Home Guard member when he was asked to sign the Official Secrets Act and found himself one of 3,500 volunteers recruited to Britain's resistance army. "We were sent to a base in Oxfordshire," Mr Miners said. "We were trained to kill, how to use a knife to kill a man quietly. "The plan was that when the invasion came our unit would hide in an underground bunker and let the Nazis roll over the top of us. "Then after a month we were to come out at night and attack them, destroy their munitions dumps, railway lines, things like that." Mr Miners' bunker at Cligga Head near Perranporth was one of about 500 such bunkers, known as Operational Bases, which were dug all across Britain. "It wasn't as concealed as it should have been," said Mr Miners. "An RAF corporal thought it would be the ideal courting spot, which was a bit embarrassing for us. "We had to move to another base at a former tin mine nearby." The individual units were entirely self-contained, with no knowledge of the identity or locations of the other resistance groups, although there are thought to have been about 250 volunteers in Cornwall. "We were only a small unit of seven men," he said. "After Dunkirk it looked as if the Germans would invade right away. "We had food rations for five weeks in the bunker and we had any amount of explosives. "In fact, we were so well equipped it was unbelievable." "I'm sure they would have found us in the end. So fortunately for us the invasion never happened." The bunker was about 15ft (4.6m) below ground, but has been filled in since the war. Historian Tom Sykes said: "These men were signing up to a suicide mission. "There was no way out for them, they were going to be caught and tortured, they were ready to kill themselves before allowing themselves to be captured." The Auxiliary Units were stood down in 1944 when the threat of invasion was finally lifted. Churchill's secret army became Churchill's forgotten army. "We had signed the Official Secrets Act, you see," Mr Miners said. "We would never talk about what we were trained to do. One of my unit was even sent a white feather by someone who thought he was a coward for not going out to fight, but we knew different." Mr Sykes has campaigned for years to have the work of the Auxiliary Units officially acknowledged. Now they have been granted permission to take part in the Remembrance Day parade at the Cenotaph on Sunday It is unclear how many of the men who would have made up Britain's resistance army remain alive, but Mr Miners will be making the journey from Perranporth. "I wish my friends could be there with me," he said. "I wish this could have been done years ago so they could have been there with me but I will march to represent all of them." </body>

      <title>PD James' top 10 tips for writing a novel</title>
      <description>Crime author PD James' top 10 tips for writing a novel</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24867584</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71001000/jpg/_71001660_pdjames.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Although she didn't publish her first novel until she was 42, Phyllis Dorothy James had been writing since childhood. Now a celebrated crime writer, she has penned more than 20 books, including The Children Of Men, and the Adam Dalgliesh mystery series. At the age of 93, she says she wants to write just one more detective novel. Here are her top 10 tips for being an author. You can't teach someone to know how to use words effectively and beautifully. You can help people who can write to write more effectively and you can probably teach people a lot of little tips for writing a novel, but I don't think somebody who cannot write and does not care for words can ever be made into a writer. It just is not possible. Nobody could make me into a musician. Somebody might be able to teach me how to play the piano reasonably well after a lot of effort, but they can't make a musician out of me and you cannot make a writer, I do feel that very profoundly. You absolutely should write about what you know. There are all sorts of small things that you should store up and use, nothing is lost to a writer. You have to learn to stand outside of yourself. All experience, whether it is painful or whether it is happy is somehow stored up and sooner or later it's used. I love situations where people are thrown together in unwelcome proximity. where all kinds of reprehensible emotions can bubble up. I think you must write what you feel you want to write because then the book is genuine and that comes through. I believe that someone who can write, who has a feeling for words and knows how to use them will find a publisher. Because after all, publishers do still need to find new writers. We all get old and we die and that's that and there have to be successors. I think all we writers are different. It's interesting, isn't it, how different we are? Some people have to have the room, the pen and others do everything on a computer. I write by hand and I can write more or less anywhere as long as I've got a comfortable chair, a table, an unlimited amount of biros to write with and lined paper to write on. And then the next day when my PA comes, which she does at 10 o'clock, then I've got quite a lot to dictate to her and she puts it on to the computer, prints it out and I do the first revision. In a sense, therefore, I revise as I go. It's important to get up early - before London really wakes and the telephone calls begin and the emails pile up. This is the best time for me, the time of quiet in the morning, Goodness gracious, how the world of publishing has changed! It is much easier now to produce a manuscript with all the modern technology. It is probably a greater advantage now, more than ever before, to have an agent between you and the publisher. Everything has changed and it's really quite astonishing, because people can self-publish now. I would once have thought that that was rather a self-defeating way of doing it but actually publishers do look at what is self-published and there are examples of people picking up very lucrative deals. To write well, I advise people to read widely. See how people who are successful and good get their results, but don't copy them. And then you've got to write! We learn to write by writing, not by just facing an empty page and dreaming of the wonderful success we are going to have. I don't think it matters much what you use as practice, it might be a short story, it might be the beginning of a novel, or it might just be something for the local magazine, but you must write and try and improve your writing all the time. Don't think about it or talk about it, get the words down. It is undoubtedly a lonely career, but I suspect that people who find it terribly lonely are not writers. I think if you are a writer you realise how valuable the time is when you are absolutely alone with your characters in complete peace. I think it is a necessary loneliness for most writers - they wouldn't want to be always in the middle of everything having a wonderful life. I've never felt lonely as a writer, not really, but I know people do. Something always sparks off a novel, of course. With me, it's always the setting. I think I have a strong response to what I think of as the 'spirit of a place'. I remember I was looking for an idea in East Anglia and standing on a very lonely stretch of beach. I shut my eyes and listened to the sound of the waves breaking over the pebble shore. Then I opened them and turned from looking at the dangerous and cold North Sea to look up and there, overshadowing this lonely stretch of beach was the great, empty, huge white outline of Sizewell nuclear power station. In that moment I knew I had a novel. It was called Devices and Desires. Never go anywhere without a notebook because you can see a face that will be exactly the right face for one of your characters, you can see place and think of the perfect words to describe it. I do that when I'm writing, I think it's a sensible thing for writers to do. I've written little bits of my next novel, things that have occurred to me. I've got the setting already. I've got the title, I've got most of the plot and I shall start some serious writing of it next month, I think. I never talk about a book before it is finished and I never show it to anybody until it is finished and I don't show it to anybody even then, except for my publisher and my agent. Then there is this awful time until they phone. I'm usually pretty confident by the time I've sent it in but I have those moments when I think, 'well I sent it to them on Friday, by Saturday night they should be ringing up to say how wonderful it is!' I'm always aware that people might have preferences and think that one book is better than another. I am lucky to have written as many books as I have, really, and it has been a joy. With old age, it becomes very difficult. It takes longer for the inspiration to come, but the thing about being a writer is that you need to write. What I am working on now will be another detective story, it does seem important to write one more. I think it is very important to know when to stop. Some writers, particularly of detective fiction, have published books that they should not have published. I don't think my publisher would let me do that and I don't think my children would like me to. I hope I would know myself whether a book was worth publishing. I think while I am alive, I shall write. There will be a time to stop writing but that will probably be when I come to a stop, too. </body>

      <body>Millions of red buttonhole poppies are being worn to mark Remembrance Sunday all over the UK. But is there an art to keeping them in place, asks Vanessa Barford. Every year there's a debate about popping wearing etiquette. Should you wear one? On the right or left side? What date do you start? But for some of the poppy wearing contingent, there's a more pressing problem. How to stop the poppy going Awol. Lapels with a handy buttonhole are an advantage, according to the Royal British Legion's How to Wear Your Poppy video. "If you are a civilian, make sure your poppy is always close to your heart, by wearing the poppy on your left lapel, or left side of your body," it advises. Which is good news for those that regularly wear suits and jackets, but not so helpful for the casually-attired community. For people that have to rely on their pinning skills, the charity has another tip. "Many people think that starting the pin from the inside of the material and then going out and back in is the best method. This allows the barb on the stem to catch onto something, holding the poppy securely," a spokeswoman says. But there are some items of clothing people don't want to pin. "I've got a waterproof coat on today - there isn't a buttonhole and if I put a pin in it they'll always be a gap," says Heidi Hinder, an expert in product design at Birmingham City University. "We need a poppy for all seasons." Hinder says using a small adhesive double sided velcro sticker on the back of the poppy to keep it in place could be low-cost solution. Of course the traditional paper poppy isn't the only poppy on offer. There are larger silk poppies, stick-on poppies, small metallic lapel badges and sparkly brooches that people can buy as an alternative. There are even wristbands, cufflinks and T-shirts. And there's always the Blue Peter approach. People can make their own poppy and give a donation to the Royal British Legion. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>It's 10 years since the quiz show Eggheads was first broadcast. But does everybody have the potential to be a pub quiz genius? What year was the Battle of Lepanto? Who was the first black footballer to play for England at any level? What is autarky? Who discovered the element polonium? Which actor was dubbed the Man of a Thousand Faces? Which tempo in music is slower - andante or adagio? If what just came into your head was 1571, Benjamin Odeje, state of self-sufficiency, Pierre and Marie Curie, Lon Chaney and adagio, then it's entirely possible you are a bit of a monster at your local pub quiz. Thankfully, Egghead and competitive quizzer Pat Gibson doesn't really bother with pub quizzes. Any non-quizzer encountering him might assume he was born with an innate sponge-like ability to hoover up information and regurgitate it in a competitive scenario. Gibson was Brain of Britain 2006, winner of Mastermind in 2006, Mastermind Champion of Champions, and has just won his fourth quiz world championship. Oh, and he won £1m on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? So does he have the innate ability to ambiently build up a database of trivia? Or can we consciously cram our brain with information? "I think you can," says Gibson. "It is a frame of mind. After years of carefully reading the papers it has become ingrained in me. I'm consciously looking out for interesting snippets." Experienced quizzers like Gibson go through a constant process of second-guessing the people who set quizzes. "I was watching this year's Tour de France when South African rider Daryl Impey took the yellow jersey," says Gibson. "The commentator said he was the first African to do this. I immediately said: 'That's a good quiz question'." The question would be tempting for any quiz setter as many punters might answer Chris Froome (British but born in Kenya). "I take notes from the newspapers," says Gibson. "I used to just take it as a snippet. I now save the note as a question. It gives you an appreciation for what makes a good question." Fellow Egghead Dave Rainford has also gone through a conscious process of building up knowledge. "I was reasonably knowledgeable about sport. From that my interest grew into other things," he says. Rainford has worked hard on what was his weakest subject - science. "I don't think that's a particularly strong point of mine. But through quizzing I've developed more of an interest in it than when I was at school." Both Gibson and Rainford agree that the major ingredient for building up general knowledge is having a wide breadth of interests. "Some people are happy to read through encyclopaedias and textbooks," says Rainford. "Other people can learn things in a different way. As long as it's fun for you - I don't think anyone has successfully done it as an obligation." Quizzers admit to occasionally taking educated guesses, but usually access to the memory banks is both clear and rapid. Gibson recalls one anecdote that sums up how a quizzer's brain can work. "I was once asked: Which US spy ship was captured by North Korea in 1968? In an instant I remembered being a child in Donegal and flicking through an article in Reader's Digest. It was about the USS Pueblo. That journey took place in a quarter of a second. I was back in my childhood home." But are the brains of the likes of Gibson different from the rest of us? "There is definitely a biological basis to our abilities, but at the same time relying on your basic biology wouldn't make you good enough," says neuroscientist Prof Annalena Venneri, of the University of Sheffield. "If you use strategies, you can make associations and increase the amount of knowledge you can retain. There are studies that show that when people are given a context or some sort of strategy they will be able to recall much more." Venneri says if she scanned the brain of a hardcore quizzer and a non-quizzer she would not expect to find a massive overdeveloped "quizzing" part of the brain. "What I would expect to find is differences in the way the brains of these people are connected." Neuroscientists call this "functional and structural connectivity". There are areas of the brain associated with general knowledge, says Christopher Butler, consultant neurologist and senior clinical research fellow at the University of Oxford. The anterior temporal lobe is one such area. Its role is suggested by how dementia affects knowledge. Most types of dementia do not destroy general knowledge in the early part of the disease. Early Alzheimer's sufferers can retain detailed technical knowledge built up during their careers while being unable to remember what they had for breakfast, notes Butler. But there are also forms of dementia - semantic dementia - that attack the anterior temporal lobe and therefore do affect general knowledge. Still, by understanding the way intelligence is structured, we can get better at learning the useless facts deployed in pub quizzes. Intelligence is often split into two main streams - fluid and crystallised, explains Butler. "Fluid is an ability to think flexibly, to make links between different pieces of information, to solve puzzles." The memory involved with this side of intelligence is "working memory" - the ability to hold a little bit of information in your mind while you process it. Our fluid intelligence declines from the early 20s onwards. Then there is "crystallised intelligence". This area is more to do with our acquisition of facts and increases potentially up until we are in our 70s. "The way we gain new knowledge is through using things we come across and relating them to things we already know," says Butler. "Our knowledge of the world is a lot like a web. The more links that one fact has with things you already know, the more likely you are to retain it." In short, if we have a wide knowledge base, it's probably going to be easier to retain new bits of knowledge. And there's a further way we can use linking, Butler suggests. "If you can have some sort of personal link, if you have a broader social network of people interested in things, you can tag information as 'the sort of thing my mate John knows about'." And if all else fails, it's important to remember that even hardened quizzers get it wrong sometimes. Gibson was once asked in a tournament: Which band was formed in 1972 by musicians Agnetha, Benny, Bjorn, and Anni-Frid? Perhaps sensing a trick, Gibson answered: Bjorn Again. It was, of course, Abba.

      <title>Gift cards and voucher warning</title>
      <description>Consumers warned to be careful over Christmas</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24868288</url>

      <body>Vouchers, or gift cards, can be a great idea at Christmas. Give them to a teacher, a colleague, or a teenager perhaps, and you can show you have at least thought about them, without second-guessing their tastes. But last year thousands of consumers were left out of pocket, when HMV, Blockbuster, Comet and Jessops all went out of business after the Christmas period. Most vouchers were eventually honoured but only after a period of uncertainty. In the case of Jessops, now under new management, some people were offered replacement gifts, but customers with vouchers worth, in total, more than half a million pounds never saw their money back. The fact is, if you buy a gift card, there is no guarantee it will be honoured if the shop goes out of business. So can they be trusted? Not at the moment, argues Deborah Harvey, from Newport in south Wales. She and Louise McDaid run Safeguard All Savings, a website dedicated to protecting consumers' money. She believes passionately that gift cards and vouchers should be guaranteed if a retailer goes out of business. "If I give you £10, I expect to be able to spend £10; not to be told, 'Well actually, your voucher has expired, you can't use it. And by the way, we've just gone bust, so you definitely can't spend it,'" she says. She believes the best option would be for voucher money to be ring-fenced. In other words retailers would have to keep that money in a separate account for a specified period. Another issue is that voucher-holders are well down the list of creditors, should a retailer go out of business. They are currently on the fifth tier, alongside suppliers and the taxman. Only shareholders are less likely to get their money back. The body which represents the gift card business would like to see card holders moved up the priority list. For the moment, any administrator looking at the books of a retailer is obliged to pay the banks which have lent money to the business, the costs of the administration, and staff salaries, long before they look at gift card holders. "If a retailer goes in to administration, the decision to continue to accept gift cards and vouchers is down to the individual administrator," says Andrew Johnson, the director general of the UK Gift Card and Voucher Association. A recent study by a body representing insolvency specialists looked at other possible solutions. These included the idea of making retailers who offer gift cards buy a protection bond, a form of insurance which would pay out if a retailer went bust. They also considered the idea of extending the Consumer Credit Act. Currently anyone who buys vouchers worth more than £100 on a credit card is protected, half by the retailer, and half by the credit card company. The Act could, in theory, be extended to include smaller purchases. However, retailers could be severely affected by such liabilities. Many of them trade on notoriously thin margins as it is. Indeed some argue that shops might be even more likely to go bust, should they have to honour gift cards. "All of these options are quite difficult to administer, and they are also quite costly," says Andrew Tate of the Association of Business Recovery Professionals. "Taking cash flow out of a business in the current economic climate is difficult," he says. So what should consumers do if they are considering buying gift cards or vouchers this Christmas? First of all, they should watch their local high street carefully. Blockbuster, the video chain, has already announced its intention to call in the administrators, for the second time. "I'm really concerned that there's going to be something again this Christmas," says Deborah Harvey from Newport. "And it's going to be too late for anyone to do anything about it," she warns. The UK Gift Card and Voucher Association advises customers to think very carefully about where they buy vouchers from. It says as long as you trust the retailer, you should trust their vouchers. But the reverse must be equally true. If you wish to buy more than £100 of vouchers, make sure you buy them on a credit card. But otherwise there are still no guarantees that your money will be safe. </body>

      <description>Papers react to Royal Marine murder verdict</description>

      <body>Many of the papers have been reacting to the conviction of a Royal Marine who murdered an injured Afghan insurgent. The Daily Mail says on its front page that British troops are "stunned" after the marine was found guilty of murdering the insurgent in Helmand Province. According to the paper, the verdict sent shockwaves through the armed forces with troops saying the marine had been "hung out to dry". The Mail says nothing excuses or justifies his actions but what cannot be ignored is the chaotic, deadly environment in which he operated in - one where up to 20 of his comrades had been killed or maimed. The Times reports that the tragedy in September, 2011, could be said to have its origins in the deaths of two widely respected soldiers two months earlier - which left the marine's unit with feelings of "shock, grief and anger". Nevertheless, the paper's editorial remarks that the marine was not a "shell-shocked rookie" and it is no defence that he acted in the heat of battle. It was the premeditated murder of a helpless man, believes the Times. The weekend edition of the Financial Times says there's a "real chance" in Geneva of an interim agreement which will lead to Iran constraining its nuclear ambitions. The FT is of the opinion that a permanent deal has the potential not just to resolve the nuclear issue but "spring" quite a few regional locks: Israel-Palestine, Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. "Handled right", says the FT, "this could be the deal of the century". Business minister Michael Fallon tells the Daily Telegraph that households in the south of England should prepare for gas fracking - because a study to be published soon will conclude that the process is largely safe and will not contaminate water. He says Britain has the scope to emulate Texas in exploiting shale gas. The Guardian reports that lawyers for the land owner, the Marquess of Salisbury, have written to households in Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire, advising them of his right to extract minerals from under their properties. "Furious residents" have launched a "peasants revolt" on Facebook, but they have been told the marquess wants to safeguard his ancestral or "manorial rights" that are due to expire. The Times, which has previously uncovered the grooming of teenage girls in the north of England, says that Rochdale will be scarred forever by the scandal of "systemic child protection failings". The judgement follows evidence which can now be reported following the guilty verdicts in the case of five men. One 15-year-old victim from Rochdale, reports the Times, told Greater Manchester Police in 2008 that she had been raped but they failed to act and closed the case without informing the Crown Prosecution Service. The force have admitted failings. The BBC's former political editor John Cole, who has died aged 85, is praised in many of the papers. The Independent says he was one of a select few among 20th Century broadcasters who was trusted by the public. The Guardian says Cole "revolutionised" the routine broadcast reporting of politics because he reported with a readiness to commit himself that had been common among newspaper journalists. The Times agrees, saying he significantly advanced the frontiers of political news on television - breaking stories, which the BBC had been weak in, and bringing a front-line Westminster atmosphere to his audience. The Daily Telegraph says we shall not hear his like again. </body>

      <description>Hundreds of people are feared dead in the Philippines, after Typhoon Haiyan swept through on Friday, devastating towns and cities.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of people are feared dead in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan swept through on Friday. Among the worst hit areas were the eastern island of Leyte and the coastal city of Tacloban, which saw buildings flattened in a storm surge. First reports said 100 bodies had been found there but the Red Cross later estimated a figure of more than 1,000, with 200 more deaths in Samar province. Hundreds of thousands of people are reported displaced from their homes. Typhoon Haiyan - one of the most powerful storms on record to make landfall - is now bearing down on Vietnam, where tens of thousands are being evacuated. The BBC Weather Centre says the typhoon is expected to make landfall south of Hanoi on Monday afternoon local time (between 03:00 and 09:00 GMT), although it will have decreased markedly in strength. The latest report from the Philippines' Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council confirmed 138 deaths as of 10:00 GMT on Saturday. It said almost 350,000 people had been reported displaced. The Philippines' Energy Secretary Jericho Petilla flew to Leyte by helicopter and viewed the devastated fishing town of Palo. He said he believed "hundreds" of people had died just in that area. Gwendolyn Pang, secretary general of the Philippine Red Cross, said it had received preliminary reports by Red Cross teams in Tacloban and Samar. She told the BBC it was looking into estimates that as many as 1,000 people may have been killed in Tacloban. "Our people, they saw a lot of bodies floating and we're preparing for support, for management of remains," she said. The Red Cross also reported that 200 bodies had been seen in Samar province. Video from Tacloban showed it engulfed by a storm surge. One resident, Sandy Torotoro, told Associated Press he was swept away when his house was ripped from its moorings. "When we were being swept by the water, many people were floating and raising their hands and yelling for help. But what can we do? We also needed to be helped," he said. Interior Secretary Mar Roxas said after landing in Tacloban: "The devastation is, I don't have the words for it... It's really horrific. It's a great human tragedy." The airport has been badly damaged and only military flights are able to operate, the BBC's Jon Donnison reports from Manila. John Andrews, deputy head of the Civil Aviation Authority, said he had been told of more than 100 bodies around Tacloban airport, with at least 100 more people injured. Airport manager Efren Nagrama said: "It was like a tsunami. We escaped through the windows and I held on to a pole for about an hour as rain, seawater and wind swept through the airport. Some of my staff survived by clinging to trees." Local TV journalists said they had seen 20 bodies in a church in Palo, 10km (six miles) south of Tacloban. Sebastian Rhodes Stampa, head of a UN disaster assessment co-ordination team, said there was "destruction on a massive scale" in Tacloban. "There are cars thrown like tumbleweed and the streets are strewn with debris. The last time I saw something of this scale was in the aftermath of the [2004] Indian Ocean tsunami." Communications to some of the worst-hit areas were cut off when the storm hit and it may be days before the final death toll and the full extent of the damage is known. Some 15,000 troops have been deployed to the disaster zones. However, rescuers are struggling to get to remote areas, hampered by debris and damaged roads. There were reports of looting from at least one department store in Tacloban. As darkness fell on Saturday, many areas were without electricity. Jim Pe, deputy mayor of Coron town on the island of Busuanga, said most houses and buildings there had been destroyed or damaged. Speaking by phone, he said five people drowned in the storm surge and three others were missing. "It was like a 747 [jet] flying just above my roof," he said. The storm made landfall shortly before dawn on Friday, bringing gusts that reached 379km/h (235 mph), with waves as high as 15m (45ft), bringing up to 400mm (15.75 inches) of rain in places. The eye of the storm - known locally as Yolanda - passed well to the south of the capital Manila, but the city still felt its force. In the typhoon's path were areas already struggling to recover from a deadly 7.3-magnitude earthquake last month, including the island of Bohol, where about 5,000 people are still living in tents. Britain's ambassador to the Philippines, Asif Ahmad, said on Saturday that a team of humanitarian experts would be sent by the UK "to assess needs and then mobilise resources". The head of the EU's delegation to the Philippines, Guy Ledoux, had earlier told local media that the EU was also sending a humanitarian aid team. Internet giant Google produced an interactive crisis map showing evacuation shelters, command posts and medical centres. The typhoon is now heading for Vietnam. Current projections suggest it could move northwards along the coast from Sunday afternoon local time before making landfall south of Hanoi. The BBC Weather Centre says sustained wind speeds at landfall are currently forecast to be in the region of 75-80 mph (120-130 km/h), with gusts up to 115 mph. Authorities there have begun the mass evacuation of more than 200,000 people. State media report that schools are being closed and people living in low-lying coastal areas are being moved to typhoon shelters on higher ground. Shipping has also been ordered back to port. Some 170,000 soldiers have been mobilised to provide emergency relief. Briton Peter Rosenfeld, who is in Da Nang on the coast of central Vietnam, told the BBC he had been evacuated inland with thousands of others and was on the sixth floor of a hotel in the centre. "The town is now boarded up and the streets are silent... I would be lying if I told you I wasn't frightened," he said.

      <title>Iran talks 'may need new round'</title>
      <description>Talks in Geneva on Iran's nuclear programme may need a new round, diplomats say, as tough negotiations continue for a third day.</description>

      <body>Talks in Geneva on Iran's nuclear programme could need a new round, diplomats have said, as tough negotiations continued for a third day. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told the BBC he was more cautious about a deal than two days ago, but was hopeful an agreement would still come. A deal that was floated would require Iran to freeze expansion of its nuclear activity for limited sanctions relief. Diplomatic sources said France wanted tougher terms for Iran. The Geneva talks involve Iran and the P5+1: the US, Russia, Britain, France and China as permanent UN Security Council members, plus Germany. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had earlier urged the world powers not to miss an "exceptional opportunity" to seal an agreement. UK Foreign Secretary William Hague had also urged negotiators to "seize the moment". Delegates had been suggesting that "good progress" had been made but one Western diplomat told Associated Press they were now preparing an announcement of a new meeting in a few weeks' time. The diplomat said France was holding out for tougher conditions. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius told France Inter Radio his nation did not want to be part of a "sucker's deal" and referred to "several points that.. we're not satisfied with compared with the initial text". One sticking point Mr Fabius mentioned was whether Iran should suspend operations at its Arak research reactor - a possible producer of weapons-grade plutonium. Another was that Tehran was resisting demands to downgrade its stockpile of uranium enriched to 20%, he said. The West suspects Iran's uranium enrichment programme is a step towards building nuclear weapons - a charge Iran strongly denies. Iran's Tabnak news agency said Mr Fabius "has obstructed the reaching of a deal", but Mr Zarif was more discreet. "I'm not going to tell you who is creating trouble," the Iranian foreign minister told the BBC's Middle East editor Jeremy Bowen. "Some comments have been made publicly by Foreign Minister Fabius. Obviously he has some concerns. If we try to meet each other's concerns I think we can reach agreement." Despite the differences the talks are continuing in Geneva, diplomats say, and there could still be a breakthrough. Mr Zarif said he was more cautious about a deal than before, but that an agreement was coming. He also said he had a message for US President Barack Obama - that a deal was attainable but that the window of opportunity would not be open indefinitely. The talks began on Thursday and expanded into unscheduled meetings between foreign ministers as expectations of a deal grew. Although details of the suggested accord have not been disclosed, it is thought to offer Iran a gradual easing of sanctions in return for a freeze on expansion of nuclear activities. This brought an angry response from Israel. PM Benjamin Netanyahu said he "utterly rejected" such a deal with Iran, its long-time enemy, and that his country would not be obliged to abide by it. Mr Obama later telephoned Mr Netanyahu to allay fears about any deal. A White House statement said Mr Obama had repeated his commitment to stopping Tehran getting a nuclear weapon. Since 2006 the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions - including asset freezes and travel bans - on entities and people involved in Iran's nuclear programme. Separate US and EU sanctions have targeted Iran's energy and banking sectors, crippling its oil-based economy. </body>

      <body>Two Russian cosmonauts are taking the torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics on its first historic spacewalk, ahead of next year's games in Russia. Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky took the unlit version of the torch through the hatch of the International Space Station at 1434 GMT. Live footage showed Mr Kotov waving the torch 261 miles (420km) above Earth. A three-man crew took the torch up to the space station on a Russian Soyuz rocket on Thursday. The rocket blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan crewed by three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata from Japan. The crew handed the Olympic symbol to Mr Kotov and Mr Ryazansky, who were already on the orbiting station ahead of Saturday's spacewalk. The two cosmonauts took pictures and videos of each other holding the torch using helmet cameras. The torch, which was tethered to their bulky spacesuits, was to spend up to six hours in open space. In addition to the photo opportunity, Mr Kotov and Mr Ryazansky were carrying out some maintenance on the orbiting station. The event is seen as part of a rebranding exercise by Russia designed to portray it as a strong, modern country. "Our goal here is to make it look spectacular," Mr Kotov said earlier this week. "We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work." The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. It is not being lit aboard the space station as this would consume oxygen and pose a risk to the crew. The Sochi torch will then be returned to Earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year. The trip to the space station is all part of elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. The games are the most expensive Olympics so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as by allegations from rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. </body>

      <body>The notorious leader of one of Colombia's most violent drug gangs has been arrested in Spain, police say. Cipriam Manuel Palencia Gonzalez, the head of the Urabenos gang, is wanted for a string of crimes including the murder of a police officer in Colombia. He was detained in Madrid on Friday while planning new drug routes to Spain, according to police. Gonzalez, 34, broke out of jail in Colombia in 2009 and was wounded in a police raid there earlier this year. Six members of the gang were detained in the raid and a police captain was killed. Colombia police allege Mr Gonzalez then hatched a plot to kill more police. He escaped, travelling first to Venezuela and then to Brazil before flying to Madrid in recent days under an assumed name, a police statement said. An international arrest warrant issued by Interpol warned that he could be armed and dangerous. The Urabenos gang he is alleged to have run was partly formed from members of old paramilitary groups that were established in the 1980s to tackle left-wing guerrillas during Colombia's long civil war. Mr Gonzalez, also known as Visaje, is accused of drug-smuggling, extortion and ordering the murder of police officers. Colombian authorities have reportedly linked his gang to 52 murders. </body>

      <title>Chinese leaders discuss reforms</title>
      <description>China's leaders begin a key meeting - known as the Third Plenum - where the economic and political agenda for the next decade will be discussed.</description>

      <body>China's leaders have begun a meeting where the economic and political agenda for the next decade will be discussed. In a brief report announcing that the four-day meeting had opened in Beijing, state news agency Xinhua said it would discuss "major issues concerning comprehensively deepening reforms". Areas expected to be discussed include liberalising the financial sector, state-owned enterprises and reforming China's household registration system. The talks are held behind closed doors. The meeting is being closely watched after senior Communist Party official Yu Zhengsheng said last month that "unprecedented" economic and social reforms would be discussed at the meeting. A report released by the Development Research Centre of the State Council, a state-affiliated think tank, has called for three broad areas and eight key sectors for reform. The plan, known as the 383 plan, called on leaders to liberalise the market, encourage innovation and competition, and increase government transparency. However, as the meeting is being held in secret, experts say its impact may not be apparent until much later. Analysts do not expect any political reforms to be discussed. Where economic or social reforms are agreed, local officials and groups with vested interests may also be reluctant to implement them. Third Plenums refer to the third time new leaders of China lead a plenary session of the Central Committee. They generally take place a year after new leaders take office, after they have established their power base. Previous Third Plenums have had a major impact on China's development. At the Third Plenum in 1978, former leader Deng Xiaoping announced the opening-up of China's economy, spearheading major market-oriented reforms. In 1993's Third Plenum, former leader Zhu Rongji announced the "socialist market economy" and dismantled a large part of China's state-owned sector. Security is tight in Beijing ahead of the meeting, with tensions higher than usual in the wake of last week's incident in Tiananmen Square. Five people were killed in what Chinese officials called a "terrorist attack" incited by extremists from the western region of Xinjiang when a car drove through crowds and burst into flames near an entrance to the Forbidden City. </body>

      <body>The technical director of a Paris musical died of a heart attack after a faulty power tool set off fireworks at an arena, investigators said. Police said Marcus Toledano, 41, was among several people who rushed to the scene of the blast at the Palais des Sports in the south-west of the city. A second explosion then caused a wall to collapse. Several others were injured, five seriously, police said. It came hours before the start of a musical about the French revolution. Investigators said Mr Toledano's heart had stopped when rescue workers arrived and he later died in hospital. Flowers and messages of condolence were being left near the entrance to the arena on Saturday. The injured were mostly stage hands who were setting up for the evening performance of 1789, the Lovers of the Bastille. The show was cancelled as a result of the blasts. Culture minister Aurelie Filippetti spoke of her "great sadness" at Mr Toledano's death. Producer Albert Cohen said it was terrible news. "All are efforts are going towards helping his family... in what is a difficult moment, as you can imagine." An employee told AFP news agency that only cast and crew were on site at the time. Mr Cohen said four employees who were in hospital overnight would be discharged later on Saturday. An initial investigation determined that the initial explosion had been caused by the disc of a circular saw breaking away and igniting fireworks to be used in the show. Several others received treatment, though some only needed to have their hearing checked after being exposed to the loud blasts. 1789: The Lovers of the Bastille was first shown in Paris last year and has also been performed outside Paris. The Palais des Sports has a capacity of 4,500 and is one of the French capital's largest performance spaces. It hosted the premiere of Les Miserables in 1980. </body>

      <title>Lung cancer cases soar in Beijing</title>
      <description>Beijing health officials reveal that the number of lung cancer cases has gone up by more than 50% in the past decade.</description>

      <body>The number of lung cancer cases in the Chinese capital Beijing has soared over the last decade. According to figures published by the state-run Xinhua news agency, they have increased by more than 50%. Beijing health officials say smoking is still the number one cause of lung cancer, but they admit air pollution is also a factor. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently estimated that polluted air kills millions of people every year. Xinhua said the latest figures - which are for only one city and one disease - were issued by Beijing municipal health bureau. They show the number of lung cancer patients per 100,000 people was 39.56 in 2002, but had jumped to 63.09 by 2011. The article gave no reason for the increase in patients. Beijing health officials said lung cancer was linked to lifestyle choices, with smoking still the top cause. But they said passive smoking and air pollution could also be a factor. Last month the WHO issued a scientific report detailing the link between air pollution and a number of different diseases and illness. It estimated that breathing in fine particles contributed to 3.2 million premature deaths a year across the world and killed more than 200,000 from lung cancer. "More than half of the lung cancer deaths attributable to ambient fine particles were projected to have been in China and other East Asian countries," said the WHO. Correspondents say Chinese people are becoming increasingly worried about the health problems caused by the thick air pollution that often blankets much of their country, a result of rapid economic expansion coupled with poorly enforced laws designed to protect the environment. Earlier this week it was reported that a eight-year-old girl in Jiangsu province had become the country's youngest lung cancer patient. Air pollution was blamed. The hospital that was supposed to be treating her denied the reports, but the outcry caused by the story shows just how concerned people have become. </body>

      <body>The chief of Cambodia's military forces on the Thailand border has called an emergency meeting after Thai aircraft were seen flying low around disputed land near the Preah Vihear temple. A helicopter and small spotter plane were seen early on Saturday. Tension on the border is high ahead of a verdict due on Monday by the UN's highest court on where the border lies around the ancient temple. Fighting in the area in 2011 left 18 people dead and thousands displaced. The BBC's Jonathan Head in Bangkok says Cambodian troops have dug trenches and bunkers near the temple and similar fortifications are visible on the Thai side. However, Cambodian regional commander General Srey Deuk told the BBC on Saturday he expected no problems with the Thai military after Monday's verdict. He said no troop reinforcements had been brought up to the temple. A 1962 verdict by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) declared the temple to be Cambodian but did not rule on the area around it. Cambodia sought a clarification of the ruling in 2011 after fighting broke out. Both countries have agreed to abide by the ICJ ruling but fears remain that nationalist groups may stir up violence in border villages. Thai nationalist group the Thai Patriotic Network has already said it will reject any judgement from the ICJ, The Nation newspaper reported. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen has ordered troops along the border to stay calm. "I'd like to appeal to all armed forces who are on duty to defend the border to keep calm, exercise utmost restraint and avoid any activities that could lead to tension or clashes," he said in a televised broadcast on Thursday. He said he and Thai Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra had agreed that their two countries "have to comply with this decision and try to maintain peace and stability along the border at any cost". </body>

      <description>A CBS News show apologises for a report in October that gave false information about the 2012 attack on a US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya.</description>

      <body>A CBS News programme has apologised for airing a report in October that gave false information about the September 2012 attack on a US diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya. A security contractor told 60 Minutes he had been present during the attack, but later gave a conflicting statement to investigators with the FBI. Reporter Lara Logan said it was a "mistake" to put the contractor on air. Four Americans died in the attack, including a US ambassador. Ms Logan, a reporter for 60 Minutes, a storied current affairs programme, said on Friday a source had provided false information during a report aired on 27 October. The security official, identified as Dylan Davies, said he had been at the US compound during the 11 September 2012 attack. Mr Davies reported he had witnessed the attack, fought off an assailant, and later viewed the body of US Ambassador Christopher Stevens. But other news outlets subsequently revealed Mr Davies had told FBI investigators and his employers he was not at the Benghazi compound the night of the attack. "The most important thing to every person at 60 Minutes is the truth, and today the truth is we made a mistake," Ms Logan told a CBS morning news programme on Friday. "Nobody likes to admit they made a mistake, but if you do, you have to stand up and take responsibility and you have to say that you are wrong. And in this case, we were wrong." Ms Logan added that 60 Minutes planned to air a correction on its regular broadcast on Sunday evening. CBS News chairman Jeff Fager told the New York Times Mr Davies had lied to the network. "There are people in the world who try to deceive others," he said. "We believe we have a really good system to guard against that. This guy got through that." Meanwhile, publication of a book written by Mr Davies about the 2012 attack has been halted. Threshold Editions said on Friday it was suspending publication of The Embassy House: The Explosive Eyewitness Account of the Libyan Embassy Siege by the Soldier Who Was There. The book, written under the pseudonym Sgt Morgan Jones, was released on 29 October. The attack against the US consulate - which resulted in the death of Mr Stevens, another state department worker, and two former Navy Seals - was originally said to have grown out of violent anti-American protests sparked by an anti-Islam film produced in the US. It was later revealed to have been an organised, pre-planned assault by militia forces. The US filed charges against a Libyan militia chief, Ahmed Abu Khattala, in August and an unknown number of other alleged attackers have also been charged. Republicans denounced US President Barack Obama's handling of the incident, accusing the administration of failing to provide adequate security at the Benghazi compound and of neglecting to send a force to rescue the personnel after the attack began. Also, the Republicans accused Mr Obama and his fellow Democrats of downplaying the attack in order to protect his 2012 re-election campaign. </body>

      <body>A former prosecutor in the US state of Texas has been sentenced to jail for his role in the wrongful conviction of an innocent man 26 years ago. Ken Anderson agreed a plea deal that will see him serve 10 days in jail, perform 500 hours of community service and be disbarred. He was charged with tampering with evidence in the 1987 murder trial of Michael Morton. Morton spent 25 years in prison only to be exonerated by DNA evidence. Anderson, also a former state judge, agreed a deal on Friday in the same Texas courthouse in which he used to preside. He faced criminal charges and a civil lawsuit for allegedly withholding key evidence and making false statements to the court during Morton's trial in the beating death of his wife, Christine. Lawyers for Morton said Anderson withheld a transcript of a police interview with Morton's mother-in-law and reports from neighbours saying they had seen a man in a green van parked in front of the Morton home several times before the crime, according to the Texas Tribune. Morton was sentenced to life in prison for the murder but was freed in 2011 after DNA evidence tied the crime to another man. That suspect, Mark Alan Norwood, was found guilty earlier this year. "I don't know if satisfying is the right word," Morton said following Anderson's court appearance on Friday. "When it began, I was asked what I wanted. I said, 'The only thing that I want, as a baseline, is for Ken Anderson to be off the bench and no longer practice law,'" Morton told the Texas Tribune. "Both of those things have happened and more." Anderson reportedly apologised to Morton for "failures in the system" but said he did not believe there was any misconduct, according to media reports. "In a case like this, sometimes it's hard to say what meets the ends of justice and what doesn't," presiding District Judge Kelly Moore said on Friday. "There's no way that anything we can do today will resolve the tragedy that occurred related to these matters." </body>

      <body>A US company that has developed an "electronic backpack" that fits onto a cockroach allowing its movements to be controlled by a mobile phone app has defended itself against cruelty claims. The Backyard Brains company says that the device is intended to get children to be interested in neuroscience. A spokeswoman told the BBC that the device - being formally launched on Saturday - was not a gimmick. But critics say that the company's stance is "disingenuous". For the "electronic backpack" to work the cockroaches have to be placed in icy water to subdue them before sandpaper is used to remove the waxy coating on the shell of the insect's head. An electrode connector and electrodes are then glued on to the insect's body and a needle is used to poke a hole in their thorax in order to insert a wire. Their antennae are then cut and electrodes are inserted. A circuit is attached to their backs, and signals are received through a mobile phone app allowing users to control the cockroaches' movements to the left and to the right. Animal behaviour scientist Jonathan Balcombe has been quoted on US scientific websites as saying that the insects are harmed in the process. "If it was discovered that a teacher was having students use magnifying glasses to burn ants and then look at their tissue, how would people react?" he is quoted as saying. Likewise Queen's University philosophy Professor Michael Allen warned that the device will "encourage amateurs to operate invasively on living organisms" and "encourage thinking of complex living organisms as mere machines or tools". The Michigan-based company has even received emails saying the the backpack - known as Roboroach - "teaches kids to be psychopaths". But Backyard Brains says that 20% of the world will soon have a neurological disorder - for which there are no known cures - and the backpacks "allow students to do graduate level research early in life". A company spokeswoman told the BBC that the backpack had been developed solely to encourage children to take an interest in neuroscience which, she said, needed to be better taught in American schools. "At the moment this crucially important subject is woefully under-taught," she said, "with many schools teaching neuroscience within the biology syllabus when it should be a subject in its own right. "That is especially the case when diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer's take a heavier toll within society." The spokeswoman insisted that the insects are treated humanely and that the backpack - first developed in 2011 - does not harm them. The backpack will be widely available in November in the US priced at $99 (£61). </body>

      <body>The Indian city of Chennai (Madras) is hosting the world chess championships, which could end the six-year reign of local man Vishwanathan Anand. Many experts are expecting Anand's young Norwegian challenger Magnus Carlsen to take the title. The 12-game match will be held over three weeks at a local hotel, watched by a select audience of 350 inside the main hall and by thousands on live TV. Anand, 43, has been undisputed champion since 2007. However, Carlsen, 22, is now the highest rated player in history, with Anand currently ranked only number eight in the world. Correspondents say the excitement around the tournament is reminiscent of the 1972 clash in Rejkjavik, Iceland, in which US challenger Bobby Fischer ended 24 years of Soviet dominance, beating defending champion Boris Spassky. "We will see how it goes but I think I am ready to play. I am really excited to play in my home city. I am looking forward to the match starting," Anand told the Times of India newspaper. Carlsen appeared to downplay his advantage. "I don't know who the favourite is. In general I expect to do well in tournaments I play in," he told journalists. Russian former grandmaster Garry Kasparov has described Carlsen as the Harry Potter of chess. Another Russian champion, Vladimir Kramnik, told the Times of India that Carlsen had more energy and motivation than Anand. "Anand is somewhat intimidated by Carlsen. He has not been confident playing against him - he's scared of him," he said. However, Anand has won more of their head-to-head matches. In the 12-game format, one point is awarded for a win and half for a draw. The first man to 6.5 points will be declared the winner and if the points are equal after the 12th game there will be a sudden death decider. </body>

      <body>Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, under pressure to quit after admitting he smoked crack cocaine and had a drink problem, could enter rehab, his lawyer says. Dennis Morris told the Globe and Mail that the mayor of Canada's largest city was "considering options". "And we'll stay tuned to see what he says in the next few days," Mr Morris told the newspaper. His comments come a day after Mr Ford apologised for a video of him threatening to kill an unknown person. The 44-year-old married father of two said he was "extremely, extremely inebriated" at the time it was filmed and he was "embarrassed" by it. Toronto police said last week they have a separate video apparently showing Mr Ford smoking crack cocaine, which has not been made public. His older brother, Doug Ford, told a radio broadcaster on Friday that his brother could benefit from "a little bit of counselling". "If Rob goes away on a vacation, for a week or two weeks, Rob loses 50, 60 pounds, stays on the straight narrows," he said, "it'll be tough to beat Rob Ford." Thursday's release of a video showing an agitated Mr Ford during a foul-mouthed rant was a defining moment for the mayor, Mr Morris has told reporters. The context of the clip is not clear, nor is the target of Mr Ford's wrath. He vows to rip out the person's throat, poke out his eyes and ensure his victim is dead. On Thursday, Mr Morris said he had been in talks with Toronto police to view the crack-smoking clip. Police say the video is not enough to charge Mr Ford but they have not made it public as it is evidence before the courts. Allegations of drug use by Mr Ford surfaced in May when journalists reported seeing footage of him smoking crack cocaine. The mayor acknowledged for the first time on Tuesday that he had taken the drug "probably a year ago" while in a "drunken stupor". He said he was "embarrassed" by his behaviour, though he vowed to run for re-election. Mr Ford has faced mounting calls from even his political allies to resign, saying they have lost confidence in him. But officials in North America's fourth-largest city cannot legally remove him unless he is convicted of a crime. </body>

      <title>US job creation stronger in October</title>
      <description>The US economy added a better-than-expected 204,000 jobs in October, despite the 16-day shutdown of some government services last month.</description>

      <body>The US economy added a better-than-expected 204,000 jobs in October, according to the latest figures from the Labor Department. There had been fears that the 16-day shutdown of government services last month could have hit jobs growth. The monthly non-farm payroll figure is taken as a key indicator of the health of the world's biggest economy. However, the latest figures also showed that the unemployment rate edged up to 7.3% from 7.2% in September. The Labor Department said that this was likely to be because many federal workers were counted as unemployed during the shutdown. The report also said that employers added 60,000 more jobs in September and August than earlier estimates had suggested. The latest figures add to a positive week for US economic data. On Thursday, it was announced that the US economy grew at a better-than-expected annual pace of 2.8% in the third quarter. Investors are watching closely the health of the US economy, with signs of growing strength likely to raise expectations that the US Federal Reserve will begin to scale back its massive economic stimulus programme. Chris Williamson, chief economist at the researchers Markit, said that the jobs figure had "defied" expectations of a slump in jobs creation due to the shutdown. "Analysts were expecting a mere 125,000 rise," he said. "The data will add to the view that the Federal Reserve is gearing towards a tapering of its asset purchases, but policymakers will most likely wait for clearer signs that the economy is capable of growing at a faster rate than seen in recent months, hoping to see a pace of economic growth that will eat into unemployment." In Thursday's GDP figure, the Commerce Department said that growth had been lifted by rising exports and a pick-up in construction of homes. However, it also said that the pace of growth in consumer spending - which accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity - had slowed from the previous quarter. Mr Williamson said: "The jobs report follows yesterday's GDP numbers, and together the data suggest that the US economy continues to expand at a reasonable pace, but that the underlying rate of expansion has cooled since earlier in the year, when policymakers began talking in earnest about scaling back monetary stimulus." </body>

      <body>No traces of poison have been found in the remains of Chile's Nobel Prize-winning poet Pablo Neruda, forensic experts say. The results were announced after more than six months of tests by 15 Chilean and foreign experts. The left-wing poet died in 1973, days after the military coup that brought General Augusto Pinochet to power. His body was exhumed in April to establish whether he died of poisoning, as his driver and others suspected. Neruda, who died aged 69, was a close friend of ousted Chilean President Salvador Allende. "No traces of chemical agents have been found," said Patricio Bustos, director of the Chilean Forensic Service, on Friday. Mr Bustos confirmed that Neruda's remains seemed to support the official line that he had died of cancer. However, Friday's highly-anticipated results did not satisfy everyone. "The Neruda case doesn't close today," said Chilean Communist Party lawyer Eduardo Contreras. "Today we are going to request more samples. They referred to chemical agents but there are no studies about biological agents. A very important chapter has closed and was done very seriously but this is not over." Neruda's driver and personal assistant, Manuel Araya, had maintained that the poet was poisoned. Mr Araya said Neruda had called him from hospital, and told him he was feeling sick after having been given an injection in the stomach. Chile began investigating Mr Araya's allegations in 2011. The suspicions were backed by the Chilean Communist Party, which said Neruda did not exhibit any of the symptoms associated with the advanced prostate cancer he was said to have died of. They said that the military government feared Neruda would go into exile in Mexico and campaign against the Pinochet regime. </body>

      <body>The son of Suriname's president has been charged by the United States with attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organisation. Dino Bouterse was allegedly paid millions of dollars to provide a base and weapons for Hezbollah fighters. The Shia militants were planning attacks on the US and the Netherlands, Suriname's former colonial ruler, US prosecutors say. The son of President Desi Bouterse was extradited from Panama in August. He had already been charged with trying to smuggle cocaine and weapons into the United States. Mr Bouterse could be sentenced to life in jail for the drugs and weapons smuggling charges and to up to 15 years for the terrorism-related accusations. The Suriname president's son insists he is innocent, but his lawyers have not yet reacted to the latest charges. The US authorities say they have recorded meetings of Mr Bouterse with undercover agents and informants posing as Hezbollah operatives in Panama and in Greece. "Alleged criminals like Bouterse and his facilitators pose a direct threat to the safety and security of the United States," the administrator of the US Drug Enforcement Administration, Michelle Leonhart, told the Associated Press news agency. At a meeting in Greece, Mr Bouterse reportedly accepted $2 million (£1.25m) to help Hezbollah fighters settle in Suriname, give them passports and arm them with surface-to-air missiles and other weapons. He reportedly told them he would present within two months a list of the weapons he could provide. Mr Bouterse was arrested in Panama in late August, while travelling on a diplomatic passport, and quickly handed over to the US authorities. He was sentenced to eight years in prison in Surinam in 2005, after being found guilty of trafficking in drugs, weapons and stolen luxury cars. But Mr Bouterse was released three years later for good behaviour and was later named director of Suriname's Counter Terrorist Unit. His father, Desi Bouterse, a former coup leader, was elected president of Suriname in 2010. He was accused of numerous human rights violations in the 1980s but was given immunity by parliament in 2012. In 2000, President Bouterse was himself convicted in absentia of drug trafficking by a court in the Netherlands. He has always denied the charges. </body>

      <title>'Suicide attack' at Mogadishu hotel</title>
      <description>At least six people have been killed and 15 injured after a suspected suicide attack at a hotel in Somalia's capital, the interior minister tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>At least six people have been killed after a suspected suicide attack at a hotel in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu. Interior Minister Abdikarim Hussein Guled told the BBC that 15 people had been injured after a car exploded outside the Hotel Maka. The hotel lies on one of the capital's main roads, which the authorities say is usually safe. Islamist militant group al-Shabab was driven out of Mogadishu two years ago but often stages attacks in the city. The BBC's Ibrahim Mohamed Adan in Mogadishu says a loud explosion was heard in the city's administrative centre just before 20:00 local time (17:00 GMT). The Hotel Maka is on the Maka Mukaramah road which links the presidential palace to the airport, one of the most heavily guarded areas of Mogadishu. It is popular with members of parliament and other officials. One report stated that a senior Somali diplomat was among the dead. Our reporter says witnesses nearby told him they could see the wreckage of a car burning outside the hotel. Senior police officer Farah Aden told Reuters news agency that four policemen were among the six dead. The agency reported that four cars and two motorbikes were burnt out at the scene. A police officer told AFP news agency that he could see "several burning cars, dead and injured people on the ground" following the attack. Witnesses told the BBC there were actually two explosions; the car bomb detonated after a smaller device planted in a laptop computer went off inside the hotel's reception area. The bombings came as Somalia's football season kicked off on Friday evening with a first division match at the newly refurbished Banadir Stadium in northern Mogadishu. It was the first time in more than 22 years that thousands of fans had been to the stadium. Correspondents say there was much excitement in the city in anticipation of the match at Banadir Stadium, which has Somalia's first artificial grass pitch. The Somali government is fighting al-Shabab, which is part of the al-Qaeda network, for control of the country. The militants have been driven out of Somalia's major towns by a UN-mandated African Union force of some 18,000 soldiers, which is backing the government. But the Islamist group still controls many towns and rural areas of southern Somalia. In September, the group said it was behind the attack on the Westgate shopping centre in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, in which at least 67 people died during a four-day siege. </body>

      <title>Lampedusa tragedy: Migrants 'raped'</title>

      <body>People traffickers tortured and raped African migrants whose boat later sank off Lampedusa with the loss of more than 360 lives, Italian police say. The police have arrested a Somali man on Lampedusa accused of committing crimes with the armed gang. Most of the victims on 3 October were Eritreans and Somalis. Their fishing boat capsized near Lampedusa, a tiny Italian island off North Africa. The migrants each paid thousands of dollars to the gang, police said. The gang moves people across the Sahara to Libya, where they are detained in a camp until they pay at least $3,000 (£1,866), police said. The migrants have told the police that torture and rape goes on at the camp, the BBC's Alan Johnston reports from Rome. Once the migrants make their payment, they are handed on to another organisation which - in return for more money - arranges a boat journey to Europe. The alleged captain of the Lampedusa boat, a Tunisian man named Khaled Bensalam, is being held in Sicily. The 24-year-old Somali suspect was arrested after arriving on Lampedusa on 25 October with a group of migrants. As he entered a migrant reception centre, he was attacked by some survivors of the disaster, police said. There were 155 survivors of the tragedy. The migrants said they recognised him as one of the leaders of the group that had arranged their long and disastrous journey. He is now facing charges relating to kidnapping, sexual violence and people smuggling. It is not yet clear why the suspect made the journey to Italy and put himself at risk of being identified by migrants that he allegedly mistreated. But the police say he might have been fleeing tensions within his people-smuggling network. Another theory is that he may have sought to consolidate links with criminal partners in Italy. Or he might have simply decided that he too wanted to make a new life in Europe, our correspondent says. Italian media say the Somali man's arrest followed investigations by Sicilian police and anti-Mafia police based in Rome. He is now being questioned in Sicily. </body>

      <title>Maldives votes for new president</title>
      <description>Voters in the Maldives have been voting for a new president, amid tensions after a previous round was annulled and another stopped by police.</description>

      <body>Voters in the Maldives have been going to the polls to elect a president after two previous attempts failed. Candidates came to a last-minute agreement earlier this week to agree and sign the voter lists required for the election to take place. But turnout was lower than expected, amid disappointment about political rows throughout the election process. In 2012, ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was forced from office, sparking a political crisis. He is seeking to regain power at these elections. Tensions are high after one vote was annulled and a re-run halted by police. Polls closed at 10:30 GMT. Supporters of Mr Nasheed's opposition Maldivian Democratic Party allege the government and judiciary are attempting to influence the electoral process, fearing he will return to power. Mr Nasheed won the Indian Ocean archipelago's first-ever democratic vote in 2008, ousting Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who ran the country autocratically for three decades. His main rival at the ballot box is Mr Gayoom's half-brother, Abdullah Yameen. The other major contender is Gasim Ibrahim, a wealthy resort owner and a former minister under Mr Gayoom. If no candidate gets more than 50% of the vote then a second vote is scheduled to take place on Sunday. But the elections commissioner said Mr Nasheed's two rivals had so far not approved the voter register for any run-off, which would be necessary for the vote to go ahead. In a vote on 7 September, Mr Nasheed led with 45% of the vote, while Mr Yameen and Mr Gasim trailed with 25% and 24% respectively. President Mohamed Waheed Hassan Manik got 5% and later bowed out. That vote was annulled by the Supreme Court after Mr Gasim alleged irregularities, despite observer groups deeming the vote free and fair. The court also introduced new guidelines for elections. Police halted the planned re-run on 19 October saying the guidelines had not been met, after both Mr Gasim and Mr Yameen failed to approve the registry of voters. According to the Maldives constitution, a new president has to be in place by 11 November when the current presidential term ends. Mr Nasheed was forced from office in February 2012 in what he has described as a coup. Mr Waheed, who succeeded him, claims Mr Nasheed resigned of his own accord in the face of opposition demonstrations. </body>

      <title>Murder 'must not besmirch marines'</title>
      <description>The PM says a Royal Marine's conviction for murdering an Afghan should not "besmirch" the organisation, as an ex-commander urges sentencing clemency.</description>

      <body>The conviction of a Royal Marine for murdering an injured Afghan insurgent should not "besmirch" the organisation, Prime Minister David Cameron has said. Speaking to marines at Downing Street, Mr Cameron said the "appalling" case in no way represented the spirit and proud history of the Royal Marines. The sergeant, identified only as Marine A, was convicted over the shooting of the unknown man in 2011 on Friday. A retired commander has said he should be shown leniency when he is sentenced. Addressing a group of serving and former Royal Marines raising funds for the Commando 999 charity, Mr Cameron said the Royal Marines had "one of the proudest histories of any in the world". "We should not let that single incident besmirch the incredible work the Royal Marines have done, not only over decades but over centuries," he said. The prime minister also thanked the marines for the "incredible work" they had done in Afghanistan, saying he believed "we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high". Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was a "tragic" incident and must be dealt with, but the case did not change the "esteem in which our armed forces are held". Marine A faces a mandatory life sentence but a minimum term will be set on 6 December. Maj Gen Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade during the Falklands War, said a five-year or 10-year term would be more appropriate than life. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the shooting of the Afghan insurgent in Helmand Province was "totally wrong, totally unforgiveable" and it was "quite right" that Marine A would be sentenced. But he said we did not know what pressure the sergeant might have been under in the past. "I understand that he's quite an experienced guy. People are talking about him being battle hardened and therefore there is no excuse. "Well actually it's the other way round, the more times you do tours in that filthy war, the more pressure there is on you," he said. He said some sort of clemency should be exercised. "He certainly shouldn't serve any less than five years, maybe 10. I hope that his behaviour and the fact he truly regrets what he did would be taken into account when the time comes," he said. Military commentator Colonel Mike Dewar said he was "horrified" by Marine A's actions but echoed calls for clemency, saying society had to make "exceptions for soldiers in extraordinary circumstances". "These soldiers have had their officer killed - their platoon commander, a very fine young man - they had seen their friends brutalised, lost legs, they had been under the pressures of battle for weeks and months," he said. But former Army Major Richard Streatfeild told the BBC it was too soon to tell what kind of sentence would be appropriate. "We don't know enough about his personal situation in terms of a plea of mitigation yet," he said. However, he said he agreed with Maj Gen Thompson about the "cumulative effect" war could have on members of the armed forces. It is the first time a member of the British forces has faced a murder charge in relation to the conflict in Afghanistan, which began in 2001. Two other marines were cleared after the trial at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. An anonymity order was granted last year to protect the three men from possible reprisals. The murder took place after a patrol base in Helmand Province came under attack from small arms fire from two insurgents. The Afghan prisoner had been seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field. One of the cleared marines - known as Marine B - inadvertently filmed the murder on his helmet-mounted camera and that footage, taken on 15 September 2011, was shown to the court during the two-week trial. It showed Marine A shooting the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol, and saying: "There, shuffle off this mortal coil... It's nothing you wouldn't do to us." He adds: "Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention," to which Marine B replies: "Yeah, roger mate." During the court martial, prosecutor David Perry told the court the murder was "not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. It amounted to an execution". Marine A told the court martial he had fired because of "poor judgement and lack of self-control", but said he had thought the insurgent was already dead. Marines B and C were accused by the prosecution of being "party to the killing" and of having "encouraged and assisted" Marine A to commit the murder. At the time of the killing, Marine A was an experienced sergeant, Marine B was new to the Helmand base, while Marine C was the most junior of the three. </body>

      <title>Spain releases eight Eta militants</title>
      <description>Spain releases eight of nine jailed militants from the Eta Basque separatist group after a European rights ruling.</description>

      <body>Eight - out of nine- jailed militants from the Eta Basque separatist group have been released by Spain's top criminal court. The Audiencia Nacional's decision on Friday follows a European court ruling which overturned Spain's extension of Eta prisoners' sentences. Only one remained in jail on Friday night, Spanish media reported. A violent 40-year campaign by Eta killed more than 800 people. The group declared a ceasefire in 2011. Spain and some of its Western allies, including France and the UK, consider Eta a "terrorist" organisation. Last month there was bitterness among relatives of Eta victims when Eta member Ines del Rio was released. On 21 October the European Court of Human Rights upheld its 2012 ruling against Spain which opposed a legal practice known as the "Parot doctrine" - which allowed prison terms to be extended for people convicted of terrorist offences. The next day Spain released Ines del Rio, who was serving a 30-year prison sentence for her role in bomb attacks in the 1980s. Friday's court decision related to the cases of 11 prisoners. The judges ruled narrowly in favour of releasing nine of the prisoners. Nine judges supported their release, and eight were against. One of the first to be freed was Domingo Troitino, jailed for a 1987 attack on a supermarket in Barcelona which killed 21 people. He is the brother of Antonio Troitino, who was released from custody in London last month in line with the European court ruling. The other eight are: Jokin Mirena Sancho, Isidro Maria Garalde, Jose Ignacio Urdiain, Jon Koldo Aginagalde, Joseba Koldobika, Elias Fernandez Castanares, Juan Francisco Gomez Lopez and Luis Maria Azkargorta. A Spanish ruling in March 2006 meant that the most serious criminals in Spain could not qualify for early release. But the European Court in Strasbourg said the ruling must not apply retroactively and so, it argued, dozens of Eta prisoners and other criminals convicted before that date should be released. Spain's courts are expected to free a further 43 Eta prisoners, most of whom were convicted of multiple murders, the BBC's Tom Burridge reports from Madrid. The Strasbourg ruling has been condemned by organisations in Spain representing the victims of Eta bombings and murders. </body>

      <title>War crimes charges for Kosovo rebels</title>
      <description>An EU prosecutor indicts 15 former Kosovo rebels on charges of torturing and killing civilians during the 1998-99 separatist war with Serbia.</description>

      <body>An EU prosecutor has indicted 15 former Kosovo rebels on charges of torturing and killing civilians during the 1998-99 separatist war with Serbia. Many of those indicted are said to be members of the governing Democratic Party of Kosovo. Lawyers for some of the 15 have rejected the charges. Kosovo war veterans groups said the indictments were politically motivated. The EU prosecutes war crimes in Kosovo seen as too sensitive for local courts. Eulex, the EU's Rule of Law mission in Kosovo, said the charges related to crimes allegedly committed at a detention centre run by Kosovo Liberation Army rebels in 1998. "The defendants are charged with criminal offences of war crimes against civilian population, including torture, mistreatment of prisoners, and murder," it said in a statement. The detention facility was located in Drenica, the KLA's north-western stronghold in its fight against the armed forces of then Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic. Eulex did not name the defendants, but reports said they included members of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci's Democratic Party of Kosovo. Lawyers for two men - Sylejman Selimi, a former KLA commander who is now Kosovo's ambassador to Albania, and Sami Lushtaku, the mayor of the northern town Srbica - have denied their clients were involved in war crimes. Eulex investigations into former rebels have previously provoked angry protests from ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority fought an insurgency against Serb forces in the late 1990s, in which more than 10,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands driven from their homes. Nato bombed Serb positions to halt the mass ethnic cleansing and, in June 1999, Kosovo was placed under UN administration. Kosovo formally declared independence from Serbia in 2008, a move that was opposed by Belgrade. The international community is split over recognition. The indictments against the 15 former rebels is the third high-profile war crimes case launched by Eulex. In June, three former KLA commanders were convicted for abusing civilian detainees in a rebel-run prison. In September, Fatmir Limaj - a former top KLA commander who is a senior Democratic Party figure - and nine other people were acquitted after a Eulex indictment accused them of abusing civilians at a detention centre. </body>

      <title>Palestinians eye Israel over Arafat</title>
      <description>Palestinian officials say Israel is the only suspect in the 2004 death of Yasser Arafat, after a report said his remains had high levels of polonium.</description>

      <body>The Palestinian committee investigating the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004 has said Israel is the "only suspect". A Swiss report published this week said specimens from Arafat's exhumed body contained unexpectedly high levels of the radioactive element, polonium-210. The Palestinian investigators said the report showed Arafat did not die because of old age or ill health, but was the victim of an "assassination". Israel's government has dismissed any suggestion that it was involved. The Palestinian leader died in Paris, less than a month after being taken ill in the West Bank. His medical records said he had a stroke resulting from a blood disorder. His widow, Suha, objected to a post-mortem at the time but agreed to allow Swiss, Russian and French experts to take samples from her late husband's remains last November after traces of polonium-210 were found on Arafat's personal effects in 2011. At a news conference in the West Bank city of Ramallah on Friday, the head of the Palestinian committee, Tawfik Terawi, directly blamed Israel for Arafat's death. "It is not important that I say here that he was killed by polonium,'' he said. "But I say, with all the details available about Yasser Arafat's death, that he was killed and that Israel killed him." Mr Terawi did not present evidence of Israeli involvement, other than what he said were "statements by Israeli leaders who at the time said that Yasser Arafat should go, and should disappear". "We say that Israel is the prime, fundamental and only suspect in the case of Yasser Arafat's assassination, and we will continue to carry out a thorough investigation to find out and confirm all the details and all elements of the case," he added. It is not clear how the Palestinian investigators believe the poison was administered to Arafat, who was surrounded by guards and a close circle of aides at his Muqataa compound in Ramallah at the time. The BBC's Yolande Knell, who was at Friday's hearing, said that in response to that question, Mr Terawi said he had "security information" but could not make it public. Israel emphatically denied the allegations. "I will state this as simply and clearly as I can: Israel did not kill Arafat, period. And that's all there is to it," Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor told the BBC. "The Palestinians need to stop levelling these accusations without a shadow of proof. Enough is enough." Suha Arafat believes the findings prove her late husband was murdered, but says he had many enemies around the world and could not directly accuse anyone. "I can't accuse anybody. Everybody wants to accuse Israel - I can't accuse - I can't jump into conclusion," she told the BBC. She has called for an international inquiry, but Mr Terawi said that was a decision for the Palestinian Authority. The French authorities have opened a murder probe. On Wednesday, al-Jazeera revealed the findings of 10 experts at the Vaudois University Hospital Centre (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland. "New toxicological and radio-toxicological investigations were performed, demonstrating unexpectedly high levels of polonium-210 and lead-210 activity in many of the analysed specimens" taken from Arafat's ribs, pelvis and soil that absorbed his bodily fluids, their report said. Despite the lack of adequate biological samples and the long period between burial and the investigation, they concluded that the results "moderately support" the theory that Arafat's death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210. The head of the Swiss team, Prof Francois Bochud, told reporters on Thursday: "Was polonium the cause of the death for certain? The answer is no, we cannot show categorically that hypothesis that the poisoning caused was this or that." At Friday's news conference in Ramallah, the medical expert on the Palestinian committee quoted the separate report by the Russian Federal Medico-Biological Agency. "The outcome of the comprehensive report on the levels of polonium-210 and the development of his illness does not give sufficient evidence to support the decision that polonium-210 caused acute radiation syndrome leading to death," said Dr Abdullah Bashir. But Dr Bashir noted the Russian scientists had still found "large amounts" of polonium-210 in Arafat's remains, and said their report further "supports our theory" that he did not die of disease or old age, "but rather by poisonous material". </body>

      <title>Yemen police 'stop child's wedding'</title>
      <description>Yemeni authorities say they have intervened to stop the wedding of a nine-year-old girl, as the issue of child marriage attracts international attention.</description>

      <body>The human rights ministry in Yemen says that one of its officials has managed to stop the wedding of a nine-year-old girl, due to take place on Friday. An official told the BBC it was the first such intervention to stop a child marriage in Yemen. The child, Hiba, was due to have been married on 8 November in the southern city of Taiz. The issue of young Yemeni girls being married off by their families has drawn growing international concern. Some of the families are motivated by the traditional dowry system. Hiba's story is not unusual in Yemen. She is looked after by her father, who married again after Hiba's mother died. An official from the local office of the human rights ministry heard about the planned wedding. The ministry has put the issue of child marriage at the very top of its agenda. The official contacted the police station near where Hiba lives, and the police decided to intervene. They spoke to Hiba's father and persuaded him not to marry his daughter off. Fuad al-Ghaffari, a senior official in the office of the Human Rights Minister, Hooria Mashhour, said he was proud of the action taken by his colleague, as well as the police. He told the BBC that it was the first time such an intervention had taken place. The women's rights group, Equality Now, has listed the stories of some of the young girls who have been through this experience. Wafa, it says, was married at 11 to a 40-year-old who raped and tortured her. A lawyer hired by the group and the Yemeni Women Union managed to arrange her divorce. Another 11-year-old, Fawziya, died in childbirth. Salwa, a 12-year-old girl, killed herself by throwing herself off a roof. A recent, widely-reported case, which was not officially corroborated, of an eight-year-old girl said to have died of internal injuries after her wedding night, prompted renewed calls for action. The Yemeni Human Rights Ministry is trying to build pressure at every level of government to bring in a legally-sanctioned minimum marriage age to stop such abuse. Officials there say they are making some progress, suggesting that the minister of legal affairs may soon propose a draft law. There have also been moves to try to enshrine in the new constitution being drafted a clause to end child marriage and make the minimum age 18. But powerful traditional elements, including religious clerics and tribal leaders, remain opposed and say they will block this. As for Hiba, her fate still remains in the balance. Without any legal sanction, human rights officials say there is nothing to stop her still being married off at a later date. </body>

      <body>BT Sport has announced an exclusive £897m three-year deal to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League football matches. The broadcaster has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season from 2015 after talks with European governing body Uefa. A BT spokesman said it had "shaken up the UK TV market" and would make some matches, including finals, free to air. The news is a major blow to Sky and ITV, which currently share the rights. While BT said it was the first time a single UK broadcaster had won the exclusive live rights to all matches from the two tournaments, Sky said the deal was "far in excess" of its own valuation. "I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Champions League and Europa League," said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. ITV has been the free-to-air broadcaster of the Champions Leage since it launched in 1992. "We were not prepared to pay over the odds in the latest live rights round," read an ITV statement. "Viewers will be able to continue to watch both competitions free on ITV through to 2015 and we remain the home of live England football." The new contract, priced at £299m a season, is worth more than double the current arrangement, which could mean significantly more money for clubs in the two European competitions. Each of the 32 teams in the group phase of the Champions League currently receive a participation payment of around £7m and £396,000 for every match played in the group stages. The winners get more than £30m in total. As part of the deal, BT has said it will show at least one match involving each participating British team for free every season. "We are new to the market. The key for us is growing our broadband business. We are available on all platforms. If customers do not want to be BT broadband customers, they can pay for the service as well," Patterson told BBC News. John Petter, boss of the company's consumer division, added: "Today, to get the whole competition, you typically have to pay Sky £40 or so a month. The pricing is not being announced today, but I can say that this will be far more affordable than currently." However, Sky indicated its rival had paid much more than it was prepared to offer. "We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation," read a statement from Sky. "There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more. "Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering." BT launched its UK sports channels on 1 August 2013 in a challenge to the dominance of sports coverage on Sky. BT has already spent £738m over three years for the rights to show 38 live Premier League matches for the 2012-13 season, while Sky paid £2.3bn for 116 matches a season. Other events in the BT portfolio include the rights to Premiership Rugby and motorsports such as Moto GP and Nascar, as well as taking over ESPN's UK sports channels. Only last week, it said more than two million people had subscribed to its television sports channels since August and reported six month pre-tax profits of £948 million. For its part, Sky announced in October that record numbers had tuned into the start of the football season  - with an average audience of 1.55m compared with 1.29m last year. BBC News business correspondent Joe Lynam said: "Sky has achieved well over 10 million paying subscribers in the UK. The backbone of that success is well-presented live football coverage. "While Sky has seen off challenges from ITV Digital, ESPN and Setanta, BT is posing the most formidable challenge. "BT is already in almost every UK home with a telephone line and is also the largest broadband provider in the market. It isn't charging anything to show live Premier League football for existing broadband customers but will be charging for some Champion League games from 2015, although no pricing structure has been published. "Their aim of becoming the home of live football coverage in Britain takes a giant step forward with this announcement and might even have an impact on Sky shares when trading restarts on Monday." </body>

      <body>Glasgow is to host the 20th MTV Europe Music Awards (EMA) next year, it has been announced. The event will be held at the city's £125m Hydro Arena, which opened in October, and has a capacity of 13,000. Bruce Gillmer, from Viacom International Media Network (VIMN), confirmed the ceremony would be held in Glasgow for the first time. It follows discussions between MTV, Glasgow City Marketing Bureau and EventScotland. The MTV EMA was held in Edinburgh in 2003. This year's event is taking place in Amsterdam on Sunday, and will include performances by Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Katy Perry, Snoop Dog and Kings of Leon. Mr Gillmer, executive vice president of talent, music programming and events for VIMN, said: "Each year, the MTV EMA is an amazing, multi-platform music experience for our audiences around the world, presented through a dynamic, talent-driven spectacle that only MTV can deliver. "As one of the world's great music cities, Glasgow is always a favourite with artists and the new SSE Hydro will provide the perfect backdrop for the MTV EMA in its 20th anniversary year. We're thrilled that the eyes of the music world will be on Glasgow next year." Councillor Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chairman of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, said: "It has been our ambition as part of Glasgow's major events strategy to attract the MTV EMA for a number of years and I'm delighted that MTV has accepted the city's invitation. "Glasgow proved to be the ideal destination for MTV Crashes in 2010, when Diddy Dirty Money and a fantastic crowd showed MTV's global audience that Glasgow is a city that knows how to party. "Since then, we've been working to bring the world's greatest music event to Glasgow and I'm delighted we can today announce the next chapter in this exciting partnership. "Hosting an event of the magnitude and international reach of the MTV EMA reinforces Glasgow's enviable reputation as one of the world's leading music cities." Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "2014 is going to be an incredible year for Scotland and it is fantastic news that the MTV EMA will be coming to Glasgow. "As a signature event on the Homecoming Scotland 2014 programme, we will welcome the world to the EMA and showcase Glasgow and Scotland to nearly 700 million households through MTV's global network of channels. "The awards are a highlight on the global music calendar and next year it is fitting that it should be held in Scotland, the perfect stage for events, in Glasgow's newest venue, the spectacular SSE Hydro." </body>

      <title>S&amp;P cuts France credit rating to AA</title>
      <description>Standard and Poor's cuts France's credit rating again to AA, almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status.</description>

      <body>Standard and Poor's (SandP) has cut France's credit rating to AA from AA+. The moves comes almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status. SandP said it downgraded France because high unemployment in the country was making it hard for the government to make important reforms which would boost growth, The French government responded by saying that its debt rating was one of the safest in the eurozone. SandP said it expected government debt to hit 86% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 and unemployment to remain above 10% until 2016. The country's Finance Minister, Pierre Moscovici, said SandP had made "critical and inexact judgements". He said in a statement: "During the last 18 months the government has implemented major reforms aimed at improving the French economic situation, restoring its public finances, and its competitiveness." In theory, a lower credit rating makes borrowing more expensive. The return for investors buying French debt indeed did rise after the announcement. The yield on French government 10-year bonds rose more than 20 basis points to 2.389% from 2.158%. SandP said in its statement: "We believe the French government's reforms to taxation, as well as to product, services and labour markets, will not substantially raise France's medium-term growth prospects and that ongoing high unemployment is weakening support for further significant fiscal and structural policy measures." Our business editor, Robert Peston, said SandP was "very publicly criticising France for not doing more to lift its economy out of the economic doldrums and cut persistently high unemployment". He said that, coming on the back of yesterday's decision by the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to almost zero, to ward off the threat of deflation and a return to recession, it was more evidence that the eurozone's structural weaknesses are far from being fixed. The French Prime Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said France's ratings remained among the best in the world and that the agency did not take into account all the reforms made by the government. However, the downgrade could be the last for some time. SandP attached a "stable outlook" to France, which implies a less than one-in-three chance that it would change France's rating over the next two years. </body>

      <title>China data adds to recovery hopes</title>
      <description>China's exports and imports rise in October, the latest in a series of figures indicating a recovery in its economy.</description>

      <body>China's exports and imports rose in October, the latest in a series of figures indicating a recovery. Exports, a key driver of its growth, rose 5.6% from a year earlier, while imports jumped 7.6%. This follows data released this month which showed that manufacturing activity in China grew at its fastest pace in 18 months in October. The numbers come ahead of key meetings of China's Communist Party, with economic reforms set to be discussed. Known as the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the meeting will run from 9 to 12 November, and top leaders are expected to discuss reforming key areas such as the financial sector and state-owned enterprises. China's economy, the world's second biggest, has shown signs of a pick-up after seeing its growth rate slow in first half of the year. Its economy grew 7.8% in the July-to-September quarter from a year earlier, up from the 7.5% expansion recorded in the previous three months. Some analysts said the pick-up had been helped by a recovery in demand from key export markets such as the US. "Combined with the better export data in Korea and Taiwan, China's export numbers suggest some - although not yet decisive - improvement in global demand momentum," said Louis Kuijs, an economist with Royal Bank of Scotland. Over the past few months Beijing has also announced stimulus measures aimed at helping exporters and boosting domestic demand. These include tax breaks for small businesses, reduced fees for exporters and the opening up of railway construction. Analysts said that domestic consumption in China was likely to pick up in coming months and help boost its overall growth. "Domestic demand is still holding up, which can be seen from the import growth, and the recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figure also indicated that the domestic demand will continue to gain more steam in the coming quarters," said Sun Junwei, an economist with HSBC Global Research in Shanghai. Earlier this month, China also reported that its services sector, which accounts for almost 43% of its overall economy, grew at its fastest pace in a year in October, The positive data follows a rise in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment in September. </body>

      <title>Nissan's Ghosn warns UK over EU exit</title>
      <description>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn has told the BBC. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election in 2015. But Mr Ghosn also added that he considered the exit scenario to be unlikely. Nissan's new model will be built in Sunderland, where it employs 6,500. When asked how Nissan would react if the UK were to leave the EU, Mr Ghosn said: "If anything has to change, we [would] need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future." Praising the Sunderland plant, Mr Ghosn told the BBC it was one of the most productive in Europe and said Nissan was "blessed" to own it. With sales of more than 240,000 last year, the Qashqai, to be built in Sunderland, is Nissan's best-selling car in Europe. The car accounts for more than half the output of the Sunderland plant and Mr Ghosn says the new model "ensures" a lot of jobs in the city. This is not the first time that Mr Ghosn has linked Nissan's UK investment to the country's role within the EU. In October 2002, he told the BBC News website that the Sunderland plant's future would depend on whether the UK adopted the euro. However, the UK has continued to use the pound and Nissan is still making cars in Sunderland. Mr Ghosn, who is also chief executive of Nissan's sister company Renault, says that after five years of decline the European car market is arriving at "the end of the tunnel". He says that next year, the European market should be stable with possibly a little growth. Action by the European Central Bank, including Thursday's cut in interest rates, could help that recovery according to Mr Ghosn. </body>

      <title>Federer sets up Nadal semi-final</title>
      <description>Roger Federer will take on Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals of the World Tour Finals after beating Juan Martin Del Potro.</description>

      <body>Roger Federer battled to a brilliant three-set win over Juan Martin Del Potro to set up a semi-final clash with Rafael Nadal at the World Tour Finals. The Swiss, 32, won 4-6 7-6 (7-2) 7-5 and will face world number one Nadal in the last four at 1400 GMT on Sunday. Federer trailed in all three sets and came back from 3-0 down in the decider against fourth seed Del Potro. Novak Djokovic, who plays Richard Gasquet at 2000 GMT, faces Stanislas Wawrinka in Sunday's second semi-final. A capacity crowd had gathered at the O2 Arena, many of them decked out in the Swiss colours, to see if Federer could repeat last week's win over Del Potro in Paris. They were not to be disappointed. Asked afterwards how he had felt to fall behind for a third time in the final set, Federer said: "I was probably slightly angry more than thinking it's going to be over soon. "It's one of those moments today - because I kind of fought back the whole match, the first, second set - 'Here we go again.' Once on even terms, I was able to play a little bit more freely. "For the first time I was almost feeling like I was kind of in the lead. [It was a] great finish. To get the victory was a great feeling, so I was very happy." The six-time champion started poorly, with two errors on his favoured forehand side seeing him slip to 0-40 in the first game and a third, wild effort giving up the break. Del Potro took command, cracking one thunderous forehand return on the way to the double break and a 5-1 lead, before Federer then produced a 10-minute spell reminiscent of his best days. The 17-time Grand Slam champion cut the deficit to 5-4, thanks in part to his now functioning forehand, and threatened to level with two more break points in game 10, but Del Potro passed the test of nerve admirably. The Argentine sent down two heavy first serves out wide to get out of trouble and clinched the set, dampening the growing excitement among the Federer fans. That optimism became something closer to gloom when their man netted a backhand to fall a break down early in the second, prompting a rare outburst of frustration from the man himself, but once again Federer found his game when behind. From 3-1 down, 12 points in a row saw Federer sweep back into contention, and as so often in the past his more attacking instinct held sway in the tie-break. The last six matches between the pair had gone the distance, and the pattern repeated itself in a thrilling climax to the contest. Once again Federer recovered a deficit, moving brilliantly in defence as he came back from 3-0 down to level, and now hitting more confidently he took on the Del Potro serve at 5-5 to break when the Argentine fired long. The drama was not over, Del Potro earning a break-back point as Federer tried to serve it out, but he netted a backhand and the seven-time Wimbledon champion closed out one of his best wins of the year with an ace. Del Potro admitted: "I'm a little disappointed about my match today. I think I got two chances to win - I broke his serve in the second set and in the third. "But also he played great when I was up in the score, and he deserved to come back in both sets." </body>

      <body>England tuned up for next week's game against world champions New Zealand with a comfortable 31-12 victory over Argentina at Twickenham. However, while England started brightly, their second-half performance gave reasons for concern. With England's forwards providing a solid platform and quick ball, Joe Launchbury, Billy Twelvetrees and Chris Ashton scored first-half tries. But England were poor after the restart until replacement Ben Morgan scored a late try as a capacity crowd was reduced to virtual silence at times. The win means England are unbeaten at home in 2013, while Argentina have lost their last seven Tests following a winless Rugby Championship. But New Zealand are sure to provide a far sterner examination than this disjointed Pumas outfit, who were being led by new head coach Daniel Hourcade for the first time following the resignation of Santiago Phelan. Argentina were also without captain Juan Martin Fernandez Lobbe and Racing Metro full-back Juan Martin Hernandez, arguably their two best players. Owen Farrell gave the home side an early lead with a straightforward penalty after Tom Wood, who was all over the pitch in the opening exchanges, forced an infringement. But Nicolas Sanchez levelled from the tee almost immediately from the restart after Lee Dickson's attempted clearance was charged down and Courtney Lawes gave away a needless penalty. But when Farrell refused a penalty opportunity and opted to kick for the corner instead it was a clear indication of England's try-scoring intentions. And Wasps lock Launchbury duly obliged, going over from close range after a destructive rolling maul. Farrell's Saracens team-mate Marcello Bosch hit back with a long-range penalty only for England to come surging back. First Ben Foden went on a dart down the left wing before Ashton, whose England place is in jeopardy following some under-par performances of late, came crashing into the line off the right. However, Ashton maybe should have done better shortly afterwards, opting to step inside instead of going for the corner and coming up just short of the line. But with Argentina's defence in disarray, centre Twelvetrees, who also came in for some criticism for his performance against the Wallabies, burst over for a try, taking three or four defenders with him. Ashton further increased the lead when he appeared on Farrell's right shoulder, after some dynamic work in the loose by Dylan Hartley, and dived over for his 18th England try and his first since February. Having looked assured before the break, England looked far from it in the second half, which was characterised by slow recycling of the ball, poor decision-making and aimless kicking from both sides. Sanchez reduced the deficit with two penalties before England head coach Stuart Lancaster, presumably confident the win was already in the bag, emptied the replacements' bench. But the changes failed to spark an England revival. Having previously looked dynamic at the breakdown, England became too deliberate and the midfield was almost anonymous. And while Lancaster will be satisfied with the victory, the sight of fans streaming for the exits five minutes before the final whistle told its own story. Meanwhile, New Zealand, who went unbeaten during the Rugby Championship, will be confident of gaining revenge for their defeat at Twickenham last autumn. England : 15-Mike Brown; 14-Chris Ashton, 13-Joel Tomkins, 12-Billy Twelvetrees, 11-Ben Foden; 10-Owen Farrell, 9-Lee Dickson; 1-Joe Marler, 2-Dylan Hartley, 3-David Wilson, 4-Joe Launchbury, 5-Courtney Lawes, 6-Tom Wood, 7-Chris Robshaw (captain), 8-Billy Vunipola.

      <description>A ruthless Liverpool thrash Fulham at Anfield, with an own-goal, a Martin Skrtel header and a Luis Suarez brace.</description>

      <body>Liverpool produced another ruthless display at Anfield to overwhelm Fulham and leave manager Martin Jol facing more questions about his future. Luis Suarez, once again, provided the spark for Liverpool as he scored his seventh and eighth goals of the season to lift the Anfield club into second place in the Premier League table, two points behind leaders Arsenal, who have a game in hand. Fulham were never in this from the moment Brendan Rodgers's side took a first-half lead thanks to an own goal by Fernando Amorebieta. Martin Skrtel's thumping header doubled the lead and Suarez fired in the first of his two goals before half-time. The Uruguayan added Liverpool's fourth with a rising shot 10 minutes into the second half, to leave Fulham fans streaming for the exits with their side just two points above the relegation zone after a third straight defeat. Jol says he does not fear the sack but this result will only increase the speculation regarding his future. Just when Fulham needed pace, purpose and passion, his side produced a performance that lacked all of those qualities. They were insipid, not inventive. It could have been far worse. That it wasn't owed much to Fulham goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg, who denied Liverpool certain goals on at least three occasions. This was, of course, never going to be an easy task for Jol's side. Fulham have won just once in 33 visits to Anfield. Actor Mike Myers, of Austin Powers and Wayne's World fame, watched on from the second row of the directors' box as his beloved Liverpool produced a command performance of their own. Jol will not have seen the funny side. Liverpool's starring cast lead the way, with Philippe Coutinho instrumental and Steven Gerrard tremendous throughout. This was a truly decisive response to a 2-0 defeat by Arsenal last Saturday. Liverpool have now scored 16 goals in six league games since Suarez returned from a 10-game suspension, with the Uruguayan and Daniel Sturridge grabbing 12 of them - more than the Fulham team combined have scored this season. Dimitar Berbatov was, once again, a peripheral figure, isolated and alone as the target man. Steve Sidwell and Scott Parker fought hard but were off the pace throughout. The visitors had held firm until the 26th minute. But once the floodgates opened, there was an inevitability about the outcome. Liverpool's opener owed much to fortune as Amorebieta inadvertently headed beyond his goalkeeper. Gerrard's excellent free-kick had been headed on by Suarez only for the ball to deflect off Daniel Agger and then Amorebieta on its way in. Three minutes later, Liverpool went further ahead with Amorebieta at fault once more. Skrtel lost the Fulham defender all too easily and found space to guide Gerrard's pin-point corner beyond Stekelenburg with a thumping header. Liverpool added a third before half-time. This time Suarez finished a flowing move that began with Gerrard and featured a slide-rule pass from Henderson. The Uruguayan looked up and fired the ball low beyond the Fulham goalkeeper in one fluid movement. The Reds might have had two more within three minutes of the restart, but they did not have to wait long for their fourth as Fulham threatened to fall apart. Gerrard burst forward and played another delightfully weighted pass through to Suarez, the striker considered squaring it before unleashing a thumping shot that flashed beyond Stekelenburg and into the net. With the contest over, the game fizzled out during the final 30 minutes with referee Mike Jones waving away Henderson's claims for a penalty. It mattered not to Liverpool but Fulham left Anfield with much to ponder. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said: "Our appetite for the game was outstanding. Luis Suarez is a star talent but his core ingredient is his workrate, which is something we're trying to have throughout the team. "He covers and presses and is a good talisman. Our quality was very good. At half-time I said I wanted us to be relentless, to keep pushing. "But our intensity was outstanding after the first whistle. We saw today as a very important game, and we made an excellent start. Home games are important, so it was a good victory for us."

      <title>Star Wars auditions begin in Bristol</title>
      <description>Hundreds of people queue at a Bristol arts centre for the first in a series of open auditions for two lead roles in the next Star Wars film.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of people have been queuing at a Bristol arts centre since the early hours for open auditions for parts in the next Star Wars film. Producer Lucasfilm is seeking two actors for roles in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. The parts are for a "street smart" girl in her late teens and a "smart capable" man in his late teens or early 20s, according to the casting call. Further casting sessions will take place across the UK and Ireland. The auditions, taking place at Bristol's Arnolfini, saw many hopefuls queuing up in the rain from 04:30 GMT onwards. By 10:30 so many people had turned up organisers had to close the line. "This is something I grew up with and it's massive - it's a massive deal," said Ben Millier, from Frome in Somerset. "You can't not audition for this if you're in the age range, if you fit it, because it's just a big deal." Alex Rambo, a hopeful from Bristol, said if there was the "slightest chance - it's all worth it no matter how long you have to queue for". And Tom Millineux, who had also been queuing for several hours, said he "couldn't resist the temptation" despite his "absolute lack of acting experience". But there have been complaints the auditions have been a "complete shambles" with people being turned away after they were told casting had been closed for the day. "My son spent two hours travelling this morning, arrived at 10:30 - at 10:45 they shut the doors," Hayley Mogridge said. "He then waited in line a further two hours in the rain - he is now going to spend his student loan on a cheap hotel for the night to attempt round two." Anna Brown said: "Two young people I know set off to these auditions this morning but were turned away as there were too many people and the queue had been shut down. "Sorry but that is appalling. " Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios near London next spring, with the film due to be released in December 2015. The open auditions for a "major Hollywood movie" were first published on the Twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a "nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie". Lucasfilm has since confirmed the auditions are for the next Star Wars film. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the series, in October 2012 for £2.6bn ($4bn). Open auditions also begin this week in the US, according to an online notice. Casting directors will be visiting cities including Nashville and Chicago as well as accepting online applications. While it is unprecedented for lead parts in a franchise of this size to hold open auditions in this way, Star Wars has in the past given major roles to little-known actors through the traditional casting process. That dates back to the original trilogy, when the then unknown Mark Hamill won the role of Luke Skywalker. Other movies have successfully cast secondary actors and actresses through open auditions in the past, most notably some of the later Harry Potter films. Actress Dakota Blue Richards won the lead role of Lyra in The Golden Compass, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, through open casting. Director JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the new Star Wars movie, will not be attending the open auditions. Instead, those at the auditions, who must be over the age of 16 for the female role, and over 18 for the male role, will briefly meet members of the casting team of the film. Glasgow, Manchester, Dublin and London will host open auditions throughout November.

      <title>Barlow: X Factor losers 'do better'</title>
      <description>Gary Barlow says X Factor is "a game show" where many contestants would do better to come second or third.</description>

      <body>Gary Barlow says the X Factor is "a game show" where runners-up often "do better" than the winner. The Take That star was speaking after 16-year-old Tamera Foster, one of the favourites to win, found herself in the bottom two last week. Barlow told BBC Radio 4's Front Row: "I kind of hope she doesn't win. Because I think she'd be better as a second or third, moving forward into next year." The likes of One Direction and JLS have taken runner-up spots in prior series. Barlow said the second and third-placed contestants simply "don't have the pressure of being the winner". The singer is mentoring the "groups" category on the X Factor this year. Last Sunday, he voted to save his act Kingsland Road over Tamera after they ended up in the bottom two, but the other judges outnumbered him. Asked if he felt obliged to save his own acts, even if they were inferior, Barlow replied: "You've got to remember it's a game show". He continued: "You've got to stick with your category. You've spent a couple of months working alongside them. I didn't feel strongly enough that I would say, on this occasion. 'I'm going to vote for the other act.'" Barlow also said he was aware of the pressure the music industry put on X Factor winners to succeed - because, years before Take That's comeback, he was dropped suddenly by his record label after his second solo album flopped. "When you're hot in this industry, everybody wants to know you," said Barlow. "When you're not, it's like you've got leprosy. Nobody wants anything to do with you and it was a strange feeling, especially after seven or eight years of international success," he told presenter John Wilson. "What was most shocking for me, wasn't that it had happened, it was the speed in which it had happened. "One day you have a big record label, hundreds of people all fighting your corner. And literally with a phone call, that's gone. You've been dropped," he said. "It's a tricky phone call to take, that one," he added. The full interview will be broadcast on Front Row at 19:15 GMT on Friday, 8 November 2013. </body>

      <title>M resurrected for Philomena appeal</title>
      <description>Film producer Harvey Weinstein has resurrected Judi Dench's M, as part of an appeal against a decision by US film censors to give Philomena an R rating.</description>

      <body>Dame Judi Dench has reprised her role as secret service boss M, as part of an appeal against US censors, who gave her new film a restrictive "R" rating. In a short video, the actress resurrects her Bond character and dispatches an agent to take on the Motion Picture Association of America. "Just when you thought I was dead," she says in the clip, broadcast on US TV. Philomena was rated R, meaning under-17s must be accompanied by an adult, for two instances of bad language. Its producer Harvey Weinstein, who has a history of battling MPAA decisions, explained his appeal against the rating in an interview on CBS This Morning. "Our research shows us that, especially down south and in the Midwest, the PG-13 rating is very important for adults," said Weinstein, responding to suggestions that Philomena is not a film targeted at children. "There's a certain group of people who do not want to go and see an R-rated movie. Usually they're church families, and I think this is a movie that church families would profit by seeing. I think they'll love the movie - it's very entertaining." The Stephen Frears drama, which stars Dame Judi and Steve Coogan, follows a true story about a Catholic woman's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption in Ireland decades earlier. 'Humour and joy' "There are two F-words in the movie - you're allowed one F," said Weinstein on CBS, explaining the MPAA's reason for the R-rating. "The movie is the gentlest, most wonderful true story, filled with humour and joy. They should just put PG-13 strong language [certificate] on this and make an exception." In the words of the MPAA: "A film's rating is not a judgement value, but rather an indication to parents that it contains elements strong enough to warrant careful consideration before allowing their children to view it. This instance is no different from any other film." Weinstein called the statement "absolutely wrong", and argued that the censors seemed to pick on his studio films "more than anybody else" - though some claim his protests are actually just a form of publicity. In 2012, the studio became embroiled in a row over bad language in the documentary Bully, while earlier this year the Weinstein Company was forced to add director Lee Daniels' name to new film The Butler, after the MPAA said there was already a 1916 short film of the same name. The Philomena appeal will take place next Wednesday, with a full version of the video - co-starring Coogan - set to premiere on comedy website Funny or Die. "With the blessing of Barbara Broccoli and the Bond team, M has returned from the dead to fight this battle," said Weinstein. The film is set to be released in New York and Los Angeles on 22 November before screening nationwide and is expected to be an awards contender. </body>

      <body>By BBC camerawoman Rachel Price I have been a camerawoman for 10 years, but the chance to film a rocket going into space was a once in a lifetime opportunity. After a 22-hour journey to Baikonur in Kazakhstan, we had a 4am start. We were escorted into the cosmodrome, a collection of scruffy, space buildings in the desert. Then the hangar door opened, revealing the huge, red booster rockets looming in dark. The sun started to rise, and it was like a curtain had lifted, showing the incredible vast landscape of the desert steppe with the Space rocket crawling through it. Launch Day: We filmed the astronauts as they emerged in their spacesuits in the dark, holding the Olympic torch. They climbed onto the same bus that Yuri Gagarin used on the day he became the first man to launch into space. One minute to go Correspondent Daniel Sandford stepped in front of the main camera and we had one last rehearsal. This "piece to camera" had to be a "one-take wonder" with perfect timing. Blast off. I saw a huge amount of smoke and flames, but there was no sound. We were 1 km away. The rocket started to move. Boom! The sound had finally reached us, and Daniel started talking. I zoomed out to bring him into the picture. The rocket was moving fast out of shot so I panned up off Daniel, chasing the flaming rocket up into the blue sky. A perfect take. That was what we came for. In less than a minute, the rocket was just a burning speck. The torch, strapped inside the capsule on top of the rocket was heading out of the atmosphere. </body>

      <title>Tensions flare over government 'land grabs' in China</title>
      <description>Anger rises among China's farmers over 'land grabs'</description>

      <body>With a blast from its foghorn, a huge cargo ship nudges its way down the Huangpu River, past Shanghai's skyscrapers on one side and the old waterfront of the Bund on the other. Since China opened its economy to the world 35 years ago, beginning the shift from a planned, Communist system to a free-market one, its ascent has been dizzying. But its breakneck growth is slowing, the benefits from the changes China has already made are dissipating. So China's new leaders under President Xi Jinping are meeting to consider what they have billed as new and "unprecedented" economic reforms. "It's pretty hard to find any economic system that does not need reform," says Andy Rothman, China strategist at CLSA financial services in Shanghai and a long-time observer of China. "China probably needs it more than most as its still evolving into the early stages of a market-driven economy. I don't think you'll find a Chinese leader who does not think there's a lot more that we need to do." Outside the cities, in the countryside, where almost half of China's population still lives, there is a clear need for reform. The issue is land rights. Private ownership of land is still banned, but land values are soaring. As China's urban areas are expanding they are gobbling up farms and fields. It is causing conflicts between farmers and local governments. You can see it happening on the edge of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province in south-western China. Guangji village is surrounded by greenhouses where farmers grow lettuce and parsley, cabbage and flowers. But, camped out on the edge of the village they guard access to the area. They are trying to stop their land being grabbed by the local authorities. Like all farmers in China, people in Guangji can only work the fields, they cannot buy and sell leases on land, or borrow money against it. Local governments, however, can and do seize land, re-zoning it and selling it for development. It is their main source of income. On Guangji's land they want to build a massive tourist development. Pu Yongfang is one of those leading Guangji's resistance. "Right now, economic growth and local government finances all depend on the money made from land sales," he says. "Huge profits are involved. So they take our land, demolish our houses whatever the cost. It's happening everywhere in China." The farmers have been offered 120,000 Renminbi ($20,000; £12,250) per acre but, he says, the authorities have sold land in nearby villages to developers for three times that. Recently, van loads of riot police were sent to detain two local men. Residents say the police fired tear gas and pellets but were driven away, police vehicles were smashed up. "What we are facing now is a government that is collaborating with big companies to rob us of our land by illegal means," says Mr Pu. "They've threatened us and tried to bribe us. What we want is law enforcement and human rights." And, crucially, what the villagers want are land rights. "Yes, that's what must happen," Mr Pu says. "People must be allowed to buy and sell land or use it to get loans." All around Guangji other villages are also in dispute with the local government. As news spread that we were in the area, people hurried to find us, a crowd gathered, waving documents and photographs. They all had the same complaint. Their land had been seized, they had been cheated they said, they now had no jobs, no farms, their meagre compensation was gone. They all wanted President Xi to address land rights. Zhang Gui Xian, who is 51, bursts into tears. "The police came and beat us up. Our lives, our property, our security, everything is being threatened," she said. She clasps her hands as if in prayer, and rocks back and forth while wailing in despair. "Ever since the new leadership took over last year we have been hoping the government will solve our problems. Now they're meeting in Beijing. We are counting on President Xi Jinping to save China. Otherwise China is doomed. "If Xi Jinping ignores us, what can we do but rise up? If they kill one of us, another will step forward in their place." Later, the Communist Party Secretary for Jincheng township, Yang Yingchun, told us no-one's rights were being violated. "A small number of people stirred the crowds by telling lies," he said, "only a few people are against this project." He said he had no view on whether villagers should have more land rights, reform was a matter for China's leaders. But development will benefit the area. "The Communist Party's ultimate goal is to serve the people whole-heartedly. Some villagers haven't fully understood this project, we are trying our best to get people to support it." One reform that would have a major impact on farmers is the abolition of China's system of residence permits, called hukous, which prevent them resettling in the cities easily. The permit gives them access to state benefits, but only where they are originally registered. About 200 million rural migrants already work in the cities, on construction sites, in factories, restaurants and shops. But their access to state healthcare, education and social insurance is limited. They build the cities and make them work, but are treated as second-class citizens. However, change would be contentious. City residents fear a flood of poor migrants will take their jobs and overburden hospitals and schools. Meanwhile, there are other major reforms needed in the cities. The state still controls the big banks and the financial system. Funds flow easily to the big state corporations, while private businesses - which are the most dynamic part of the economy - need better access to bank loans or bonds, easier business approvals and a lighter tax burden. But China's Communist leaders may be reluctant to loosen their grip. They have seen what happened in the financial crisis in the West. Despite all the talk of radical reform, they are naturally cautious. "The banks need to behave like real banks. But when I talk to Party officials they say we have seen [what happened] in the United States and Europe and we're really nervous about giving too much power to bankers," says Andy Rothman of CLSA. "So I think the state is going to keep controlling the significant institutions, they're just going to push them to operate more along market principles." So China's transformation into a free-market economy is far from complete. But now it is getting richer, reforming is getting harder. The Communist Party's elites have become wealthy and powerful, they see no need for rapid change that could be destabilising. So the leaders talk of reform, but it will not be radical and they will tread carefully. They will do nothing that will threaten their own privileged positions. </body>

      <body>A flood in a basement underneath the ruins of Saddam Hussein's intelligence service nearly destroyed centuries of history of Iraq's vanished Jewish community. Here is the story of the American archivist who led the effort to rescue the books and papers, enabling their display this week at the National Archives in the US capital. Three months after the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Doris Hamburg received a phone call from Baghdad. US soldiers searching for weapons of mass destruction in the ruins of Saddam Hussein's intelligence agency in Baghdad had discovered a large cache of papers and books in a flooded basement. They didn't know what to do with them and needed expert advice. As the person in charge of preserving historic documents at the US National Archives in Washington, Hamburg was used to urgent requests for help - particularly during disasters when valuable artefacts and documents were at risk. But this was unusual. The tens of thousands of water-logged pages in the basement had nothing to do with US history. They were a record of Iraq's vanished Jewish community, including religious texts and public records - some of the last tangible evidence of a 2,500-year-old culture that no longer exists in Iraq. Rescued from the basement, the papers were laid out to dry in the sun and then placed in metal trunks. But in Baghdad's heat and humidity they soon began to rot. With no time to waste, Hamburg flew to Iraq on a military plane. She arrived in June, when the official fighting had ended but the country remained unstable. Within a few months, it would descend into sectarian bloodshed. "When we first looked at the trunks full of these books and documents, we saw that everything was distorted," she recalls. "It was very mouldy, the smell was overwhelming and they were in poor condition. But we did have hope because we could see there was a way to preserve and conserve them and that they could be made available over time." Amid the confusion and chaos of the early months of Iraq's occupation, Hamburg set up a makeshift office and laboratory in a freezer truck. The documents were frozen to stop further deterioration, and she was able to examine them more closely. What she discovered was a time capsule of Jewish life in Iraq from the 16th Century to the 1970s - prayer books, philosophical texts, rabbinic commentaries, Israeli children's books, Torah scrolls, and tens of thousands of pages of records from Jewish community councils, synagogues and hospitals. Some of the books were printed in Baghdad, others were imported from Jewish centres across the Middle East and Europe. "Even today it gives me goose bumps," says Hamburg. "These documents provided a connection to a community that was once a key part of life in Iraq. Today there are practically no Jews in Iraq." Now, the documents are being shown to the public for the first time in an exhibition at the US National Archives, Discovery and Recovery: Preserving Iraqi Jewish Heritage. Most of the material can also be seen online at the Iraqi Jewish Archive, as the archive is now called. In 2014, when the conservation work is completed, the original documents will return to Iraq. For many centuries Jews had been an integral part of a multi-cultural society in the region. They were part of the middle class, running businesses, teaching in schools, participating in the arts and active in government. But during World War II Nazi anti-Semitic propaganda spread through Iraq. In 1941 an anti-Jewish pogrom in Baghdad culminated in the death of 180 Jews. Hundreds more were injured, and Jewish homes and businesses were looted and destroyed. By the time Saddam Hussein's Baath party came to power in the 1960s, most Iraqi Jews had fled - to Israel and beyond. "The Jews who left Iraq were able to take very little, so this is of great meaning to them," says Hamburg. "The documents are a connection to a community with a heritage that continues all over the world. They're a piece of that legacy." Some of the papers, such as school reports and exam cards, are touchingly mundane. Hamburg says she doesn't know what Saddam's regime hoped to learn by confiscating them, but for historians they paint a picture of everyday life for Jews in Iraq. As the 2003 conflict escalated and with no conservation facilities available, the Iraqi State Board of Antiquities and Heritage agreed to allow the archive to leave the country. The frozen documents were flown to Fort Worth, Texas, where they were vacuum freeze-dried, a process that froze the water into ice and evaporated it, preventing further damage. They were then moved to the National Archives conservation centre at College Park, Maryland. For the next ten years, archivists worked to free pages that were stuck together, clean up the water damage and digitise the entire collection. "This archive highlights the work of the new Iraq," says Iraqi Ambassador to the US Lukman Faily. "It is a message to the world that the new Iraq is recognising the history of different cultures to further better understanding. This project articulates part of that history. "These artefacts were found in the basement of the intelligence agency - the police state of Saddam Hussein. We are no longer a police state. Our constitution stipulates that citizens of Iraq have all the rights, regardless of their ethnicity or religion." He says the archive will also give historians a different perspective on the standard narrative that Jews were always oppressed in Iraq. "That was not the case," he said. "The documents clearly show that they were an integral part of the community." </body>

      <title>Analysis: Maliki bolsters Iraq re-election chances</title>
      <description>Can Nouri Maliki prevail in Iraq’s 2014 elections?</description>

      <body>There are two widespread views of Iraq's Prime Minister Nouri Maliki, who has just returned from his first high-level meetings in Washington since the US military withdrawal in 2011. One view portrays him as an emergent would-be dictator, maximising his executive authorities and crushing rival institutions and personalities using state power. Yet no sooner had Mr Maliki attained this reputation than he began to crash from one political and security crisis to another. To many observers, this suggested that his political days were numbered and that, if freely held, the national elections scheduled for 30 April 2014 would eject him from power. So which is the real Nouri Maliki: a strongman whose rule could span decades, or a quickly-forgotten character likely to be unseated in Iraq's first post-occupation polls? Initially viewed as weak when he entered office in 2006, Mr Maliki only bloomed into a more successful and confident leader in 2008 when the US-led surge allowed for decisive security operations against the Mehdi Army, a militia associated with the populist Shia leader Moqtada Sadr. Building on the momentum from these military victories, Mr Maliki began a remarkably effective consolidation of executive power that has placed Iraq's security services, the Supreme Court, the treasury, central bank and state media under his hand. Despite this recentralisation of power, Mr Maliki needed to carefully manage the political balance within Iraq's fragmented parliament after the US withdrew in December 2011. Instead, almost from the moment of US withdrawal he started to alienate too many Iraqi factions at the same time. By the spring of 2012, the Kurdish parties and Mr Sadr's allies had attempted a parliamentary vote of no confidence in the Iraqi premier. The effort narrowly failed due to strenuous Iranian lobbying on Mr Maliki's behalf, but it became clear that he would face a major challenge in securing a third term in 2014. Mr Maliki's low point came in the April 2013 provincial elections. Not only did they result in a lower haul of seats for his State of Law list - it won 22%, down from 28% in 2009 - but it also lost control of key provincial councils like Baghdad and Basra as other Shia parties allied against him. Worse yet, the role of Maliki loyalists within State of Law also seemed diminished in those elections. In his former stronghold Basra, for instance, only three of the 16 elected State of Law councillors were firmly associated with the prime minister. With his back to the wall, Mr Maliki has demonstrated resilience and fancy political footwork in recent months. He has given way to the Kurds on a range of issues, staying out of their way as they strengthened their hold on the disputed city of Kirkuk and as they completed an independent oil pipeline to Turkey. In return, the Kurds remained silent on 26 August when Mr Maliki's men on the Supreme Court struck down legislation that would have denied the premier a third term. In an increasingly successful effort to splinter Sunni Arab opposition, Mr Maliki is selectively reactivating the Sahwa (Awakening) movement of armed tribal auxiliaries and continues to promise de-Baathification and anti-terrorism reforms to Sunni factions. And the premier has sought to remind Iraqis of his role in rolling back militia rule in 2008. On Monday, he urged Iraqis to "remember the control of Moqtada's militia that fostered murder, kidnapping and theft in Basra, Karbala, Baghdad and other provinces". Mr Maliki is also playing to the establishment's political interests. He was not the only leader of a bloc to lose seats to smaller independent lists in the 2013 provincial polls, leading him to support legislative efforts to place a restrictive voting threshold on the 2014 national elections that would block the election of independent candidates. Last, but not least, international partners are being intensively courted. Mr Maliki is perhaps unique in being able to boast the US and Iran as his closest backers. Both have stepped into Iraq's political melee to save him from removal on numerous occasions since 2006. With the Syrian crisis continuing to unfold, he remains a vital partner for Iran, whose resupply flights and convoys transit Iraq on their way to aid the Assad regime. Mr Maliki has also sponsored a determined Iraqi government effort to reach out to Turkey, using Sunni Arab leaders as intermediaries to reduce anticipated Turkish opposition to his reappointment. And despite a bruising public reception in Washington, the prime minister will probably succeed in portraying last week's White House visit as tacit US endorsement for a third term. Mr Maliki is aiming to emerge from the 2014 polls as the frontrunner for prime minister largely on the basis that he is a known quantity and because replacing him may potentially be too difficult or destabilising. He stands for "business as usual", counting on the fact that most Iraqi political leaders are more afraid of al-Qaeda and emerging independent politicians than other establishment factions. It is still possible that a surprise could unfold once the process of picking a premier goes behind closed doors following the 2014 polls. One scenario for Mr Maliki's replacement may be a "Shia palace coup", where poor electoral results create an opening for the other Shia parties to replace him with a new "grey man" that they hope would be easier to control. Yet as the incumbent caretaker prime minister during the next transition, Mr Maliki will hold many important cards that could tip the balance, including control of the Supreme Court, the arbiter of election controversies, as well as the security and intelligence agencies. As the attempted May 2012 vote of no confidence misfired, Mr Maliki's willingness to step down in a peaceful transition was never tested. Indeed during that crisis, praetorian forces were brought to alert at the entrances to Baghdad and around the government centre, reacting to the potential vote almost as if it were a coup attempt. Any scenario that requires Mr Maliki's removal would test the proposition that Iraq remains a constitutional democracy three years after US withdrawal.

      <title>Sri Lanka 'rape and torture Tamils'</title>
      <description>BBC hears Tamil claims of torture by Sri Lankan security forces</description>

      <body>As Commonwealth leaders prepare to meet at a summit in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, allegations of rape and torture by the Sri Lankan security forces have emerged, some of them occurring four years after the civil war ended. "When the lady left and that man closed the door, I knew what was going to happen," says Vasantha. "They raped me." One evening earlier this year, Vasantha says, she was going back to her home in northern Sri Lanka when a white van drew up and two men asked for her identity card. She says she was thrown into the back of the vehicle and blindfolded. Vasantha says she realised the authorities had finally caught up with her, four years after the war and just as she was about to leave for Britain on a student visa. Her story is one of a number given to the BBC, horrific accounts of torture carried out long after hostilities ended. During the civil war, Vasantha had helped Tamil Tiger rebels pass messages and set up safe houses in the capital, but she says she never took part in the fighting or held a gun. Like other women I have interviewed, Vasantha never saw the outside of the building where she was held or met another detainee, but she said she did hear female voices, screaming in Tamil. She describes being photographed and fingerprinted and then kicked, beaten with batons and pipes, burned with hot wires and cigarettes, submerged in a barrel of water until she thought she would drown, suffocated by having a petrol-soaked plastic bag put over her head, before being repeatedly raped by men in army uniform. She says she signed a confession in a language she could not understand - Sinhala - but the torture and rape went on for 20 days before a relative could find her and pay a bribe for her release. For the last three days, she remembers her skin itching terribly in a filthy cell as she was kept completely naked. "On the last day, at about two in the morning, three people came and they blindfolded me again and handcuffed me. At that moment I thought they were going to kill me," she recalls. Vasantha has a medical report from an independent expert who corroborates her story of rape and torture, as well as documents to show her family reported her disappearance to Sri Lanka's Human Rights Commission at the time. She has recently been granted asylum in the UK on the basis of her story. Vasantha is one of 12 men and women who say they were raped by the Sri Lankan security forces in detention this year - one as recently as August. The Sri Lankan government says it does not tolerate torture and the military says there were only five incidents of sexual violence involving soldiers in the north of the island from 2007 to 2012. But a Human Rights Watch report documented 62 cases of sexual violence involving the security forces after the end of the civil war in Sri Lanka and said their evidence strongly suggested the abuse was widespread and systematic. The UK charity Freedom from Torture has examined 120 incidents that took place after the war in Sri Lanka, while two British doctors from the charity Medact have seen more than 60 cases of Sri Lankans branded on their bodies with hot metal rods since the war ended. "There is such a systematic set-up in Sri Lanka, whereby it's absolutely clear to me… that detention and torture is going on in a very large scale and that it's done in a very similar way every time," says Dr Alison Callaway, an NHS doctor from Coventry who has written 200 independent assessments for the Home Office of alleged torture cases from Sri Lanka in the past five years. "It must be assumed that it's the deterrent effect that they will never again be able to have the strength or the purpose to want to fight against the Sri Lankan government or undertake underground activities against them because the terror and the distress and the trauma has been so great," she concludes. A BBC investigation also found seven Tamil men who allege they were tortured in the Sri Lankan government's official rehabilitation programme for suspected former rebels. Four have documentation to show they were rehabilitated as well as medical reports corroborating their allegations of torture. Organisations such as the International Commission of Jurists and two United Nations reports have said the Sri Lankan rehabilitation programme failed to meet international standards and warned of the possibility of torture, but this is the first testimony from survivors. The Sri Lankan Ministry of Defence says it had "a world-class terrorist rehabilitation programme" that offered healthcare, education, vocational training and facilities for sports, meditation and entertainment to former Tamil Tiger rebels. This was not the experience of Ravi, who says he was forced to join the rebels for the last six months of the war but then spent four years in rehabilitation being tortured in all the places he was detained. "They would put my testicles in the drawer and slam the drawer shut. Sometimes I became unconscious. Then they would bring someone and force me to have oral sex with him. Sometimes if we lost consciousness during the torture they would urinate on us," he says. A leading British lawyer examined the evidence of continuing torture and rape gathered by the BBC along with other documentation from the United Nations and human rights groups. Kirsty Brimelow QC says: "It all equates to a crime against humanity and therefore in cases like this, normally you'd be looking at them being referred to the international criminal court for further investigation." The Sri Lankan High Commission in London said: "Allegations of systematic abuse are a travesty of the truth for they suggest that this is the policy of the Sri Lankan government. It is certainly not so." They said it was not fair to expect them to respond fully to allegations contained in anonymous testimony. Their written statement suggested the people who spoke to the BBC could have been paid to discredit Sri Lanka or even tortured by the Tamil Tigers themselves. The names of Vasantha, Ravi and Nandini have been changed to protect their identities. Our World: Sri Lanka's Unfinished War will be broadcast on BBC World News on Saturday 9 November at 11:30 GMT and on Sunday 10 November at 17:30 GMT and 22:30 GMT. </body>

      <title>Humans and elephants at loggerheads</title>
      <description>Is it right to make elephants leave their home?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24825195</url>
      <date>1383956533</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71007000/jpg/_71007626_elephants_meme2.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Elephants and humans are coming into contact with each other more often in Malaysia. The areas where elephants used to roam are being built upon or used for agriculture. Some favour relocating them to a national park - but is this the right thing to do? There were only two things that scared our native guides: Tigers and elephants. When I asked them what was dangerous about the jungle they said - in all seriousness - everything. But it was the faint possibility of unwittingly stumbling across a tiger that had them slightly on edge. Or an elephant. The latter scenario became more of a distinct possibility with every step we took. We knew this because our radio detection receiver began to click ever more loudly, indicating that somewhere in the thick undergrowth lurked an elephant that had recently been captured near a village, tagged with GPS and radio beacons, and released safely here in the national park. It seems to me there is an inherent contradiction in tracking elephants. You put a great deal of effort into finding them, but they say if you see one then you are too close. They are known to charge humans. And you cannot outrun them. The advice is find the biggest tree you can and hide behind it. We had spent three hours hacking through overgrown logging paths, pulling leeches from our bodies, swatting away mosquitoes and running from a swarm of wild bees. The plan was to find traces of our tagged elephant - more specifically its dung - and take samples for laboratory analysis. A team from the University of Nottingham is investigating the impact of the relocation process. Certain hormones can indicate a rise in stress levels with potentially serious consequences for the animal's health. In the weeks before, eight elephants had been captured near a village in Perak state and released 100km (62 miles) away, but there is no consensus on whether translocation is actually effective over the long term. The GPS collars have revealed that some make their way back home. Elephants it seems, really never forget. Next day we drove down rutted cart tracks, past half-naked children playing in streams and into an Orang Asli village - the indigenous people of Malaysia. On the way we passed electric fences designed to keep out the elephants - but many of the barriers were broken or poorly maintained. In a house made of bamboo and palm leaves we found Andak, the head man. Over tea he began to air a number of grievances the Orang Asli have against the government, but more specifically the problem of elephants. His people used to be jungle nomads, living off the land with an uncanny way of finding their way through vegetation which can leave most people disorientated and lost. But the government is encouraging the Orang Asli to adopt a more settled lifestyle, cultivating the land, with the hope of tackling poverty. Each family was given 400 rubber plant saplings worth around five ringgits (£1; $1.60) each. But then came the elephants, eating crops, destroying a few flimsy buildings and, in extremely rare cases, attacking villagers. In the past they've even attacked the villagers. Once a plant is lost, Andak says the government will not replace it, so the villagers here have stopped cultivating new ones. Andak admits the elephants were here first - but the problem is getting worse and his livelihood is at risk. "They used to come in ones and twos," he tells me through an interpreter, "and they weren't much of a problem. Now they come in herds of between ten and 12 and they eat anything they can find." The villagers used to patrol the fields at night but now they are too scared. What they need, he says, is some sort of buffer zone between the forest and the village. Conflict between humans and elephants is not new, but the pace of agricultural change and development in Malaysia means the number of clashes is increasing. There are more plantations and logging activity is encroaching on elephant habitat. On our way back from the village we stopped on a hillside and looked down into a valley where hundreds of tree trunks were awaiting collection. Beside me, clearly outlined in the soft mud, was the imprint of an elephant's foot. One regional wildlife official told me that translocation was the best solution for now, but then suggested that they could eventually create - in his words - a kind of Jurassic Park with huge fences to contain the elephants. Barriers, translocation, compensation or just learning to live with elephants - no-one believes there is a simple solution. But there is an unspoken fear that unless the situation improves things could take a sinister turn. Earlier this year in Malaysia's Sabah state, 10 pygmy elephants were found poisoned. That has not happened in Perak - yet. The elephants may indeed have been here first, but my strong impression from talking to farmers here is that patience is wearing thin.

      <title>China's quest for global golf domination</title>
      <description>China starts them young at special schools</description>

      <body>There are no windows, the floor is bare wood, the Chinese flag hangs beneath stark lighting. Not the kind of place you would expect to find a future world-class golfer. But this is how China is hoping to build Olympic champions in the country's newest sport. This is golf's basement at Beijing's famous state-run sports school, Shichahai.  About 30 children - aged between five and nine - are practising putting and chipping. They are lined up in front of mirrors to work on their grip and their swing. They do this for two hours a day, five days a week. The thumping music from the boxing gym next door buzzes through the wall, while above their heads, on multiple floors, rows and rows of children play table tennis and badminton, or tumble and twist in the gymnasium. The school is known as the Cradle of Champions.  It has produced 37 world and Olympic gold medallists in the five decades it has been open. Now golf is on the Olympic programme, it is getting the Shichahai treatment too. Taylor Li, who manages the Beijing Golf team, is overseeing the school's newest course. Junior golf started here last year. Are the children pushed to be here? "I don't think so," Li says. "I think it's quite normal if you want to be a player, if you want to do the sport better and better, you need to spend much more time than the normal people. "I think most of these boys and girls like golf and I believe they will like it more and more." Every province in China has its own centre of excellence like Shichahai. Since the IOC voted to include golf in the Olympics from 2016, five million people in the country have been given the chance to try their hand at the game. If they show promise, their education and training will be paid for by the government while they work towards becoming the best. "Present a challenge and the Chinese will excel," says Billy Payne, chairman of the Augusta National. "That's their culture and if there's a way or an award that says 'you are the best', then as a country in terms of a training programme, they will identify the athletes that at some point will make them the best." Payne is speaking in the colossal, marble-clad clubhouse at the Nanshan International Golf Club, the course that is hosting the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championships.  The prize for the winner will be a place at the Masters next April. "We're fortunate to be able to call Augusta our course," he says, "and to make it a dream for these kids has always been our goal. Not too many years ago we decided there was place in the world only just discovering golf and if we got involved perhaps we could advance the game, get more kids interested and the ultimate prize of being able to play in the Masters inspires a lot of people." Last year that prize inspired Chinese teenager Guan Tianlang. At 14 he was the youngest player ever to compete at the Masters - and he made the cut. He is back at the Asia-Pacific to try and qualify for Augusta again this year - but life has changed a little. He now has 1.5 million followers on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. So is he a superstar? "A bit," he says, looking embarrassed. His friend, and rival, 16-year-old Dou Zecheng, is also a star in the making. He swaggers around the green in his baggy trousers, trademark hat and trendy sunglasses; a picture of cool. His game is impeccable and off the course he is funny and likeable. "Wearing three shirts messed me up today," he says after a tricky second round. "It was too cold this morning." I ask him if one day we will see players like him and Guan winning all the majors. "One day yeah we will, but it won't be too soon because we still don't have enough players. But in a few years we will." For all China's ambition and enthusiasm, success will take time. Dou speaks in a perfect American drawl - he plays much of his golf in the US where he can train with other amateurs his own age and take advantage of the coaching and facilities on offer. This is true of most of China's leading young golfers. The grassroots programmes are cranking into action now there is an Olympic medal up for grabs; the new £50m National Training Centre in Nanshan  is evidence of that. But for those young players who have already given Chinese golf a global reputation, Western coaching and expertise is still better than anything on offer in their home country. Hitting balls into the Shanghai smog is Ye Wocheng. At 12 years old, he became the youngest player to compete on the European Tour, beating the record of his compatriot Guan. On yet another brand-new practice ground, his coach David Watson adjusts his swing. Watson, who is British, used to play on the European tour himself. He will not tell me how much he is paid, but he is now employed to work with Ye full-time. The bill is paid by Ye's parents. When I ask Ye if he is going to move to America, he says: "My parents are still discussing it." Watson tells me ambitious families are an essential part of the "mix" in China, where schools, coaches and the state all work together. "If you want to achieve anything in sport these days there's got to be a process," he said. "The parents need to be extremely focused as well as the child and the coach. So if you go back 20 years it was a different model, now there's a lot more younger people coming through because of the mix." The next time I see Ye, he is lining up on the tee with world number six, Rory McIlroy. A neat, cheery woman entices the crowd to cheer and clap. There are inflatable golf balls floating in the sky and a booming soundtrack. Everyone is wearing "the swoosh"; NikeGolf - newly arrived in China - is getting a slice of the sport's newest market. McIlroy interacts with the hundreds who have come to see him as best he can, and he teaches a masterclass on the course that will later host the BMW Masters. For the children he is coaching, among them Ye, it is a taste of what life could be like if they make it to the top of the game too. Afterwards, McIlroy tells me China's strategy is risky. The pursuit of success at any cost will mean the brightest stars may "burn out". "If they don't quite make it to the top they don't need to give up," he said. "It's a game you can play with your family - it's not just about trying to be the next champion or the next Olympic champion. It's about enjoying golf and having a love of the game and I think that's something China can learn from Europe." But China is taking the best of what it can from Europe and the West - coaching, tradition and investment - and harnessing that for its own ends. Rich families, the government and big business are all working towards a common goal here; to produce golf's next superstar. It may take a decade or two, but no other country is producing golfers in this way and on this scale. And if they make it to the top, perhaps no other country will be able to compete. </body>

      <title>Bank's Help to Buy role questioned</title>
      <description>An influential committee of MPs asks the Bank of England to clarify its role in policing the Help to Buy scheme amid fears of a property bubble.</description>

      <body>An influential committee of MPs has asked the Bank of England to clarify its role in policing the Help to Buy scheme amid fears of a property bubble. The Treasury Select Committee said that the "scope and limits" of the Bank's role were not clear. In September, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank to take a bigger role in ensuring the Help to Buy scheme did not fuel a property boom. Help to Buy is aimed at helping first-time buyers get on the property ladder. The government said it would assist those who could afford the regular mortgage repayments, but who were unable to raise a large deposit required by many lenders. The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit. Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales. Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan. A host of big mortgage lenders have started, or promised to offer, new products under the scheme, although the UK's biggest building society - the Nationwide - has not decided on whether it will sign up. Critics have suggested that these products would fuel an artificial housing bubble and expressed concerns about how it will be brought to an end, prompting the chancellor to ask the Bank to keep a close eye on it. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee is able to modify parts of the Help to Buy scheme to keep it in check. It can reduce the £600,000 cap on properties under the scheme, so that fewer homes are affected. It can also also make loans less attractive by recommending that the Treasury raises the fees paid by lenders for the guarantees. The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, has now written to the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, asking him to outline the Bank's role and how it would keep itself detached from government policy on the scheme. "The scope and limits of the Bank's role in this scheme need a good deal of clarification, both to safeguard the Bank's authority to act in fulfilment of its statutory responsibility for financial stability and to safeguard its independence," he said. </body>

      <title>Murder 'must not besmirch marines'</title>
      <description>The PM says a Royal Marine's conviction for murdering an Afghan should not "besmirch" the organisation, as an ex-commander urges sentencing clemency.</description>

      <body>The conviction of a Royal Marine for murdering an injured Afghan insurgent should not "besmirch" the organisation, Prime Minister David Cameron has said. Speaking to marines at Downing Street, Mr Cameron said the "appalling" case in no way represented the spirit and proud history of the Royal Marines. The sergeant, identified only as Marine A, was convicted over the shooting of the unknown man in 2011 on Friday. A retired commander has said he should be shown leniency when he is sentenced. Addressing a group of serving and former Royal Marines raising funds for the Commando 999 charity, Mr Cameron said the Royal Marines had "one of the proudest histories of any in the world". "We should not let that single incident besmirch the incredible work the Royal Marines have done, not only over decades but over centuries," he said. The prime minister also thanked the marines for the "incredible work" they had done in Afghanistan, saying he believed "we will be able to leave that country with our heads held high". Labour leader Ed Miliband said it was a "tragic" incident and must be dealt with, but the case did not change the "esteem in which our armed forces are held". Marine A faces a mandatory life sentence but a minimum term will be set on 6 December. Maj Gen Julian Thompson, who led 3 Commando Brigade during the Falklands War, said a five-year or 10-year term would be more appropriate than life. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the shooting of the Afghan insurgent in Helmand Province was "totally wrong, totally unforgiveable" and it was "quite right" that Marine A would be sentenced. But he said we did not know what pressure the sergeant might have been under in the past. "I understand that he's quite an experienced guy. People are talking about him being battle hardened and therefore there is no excuse. "Well actually it's the other way round, the more times you do tours in that filthy war, the more pressure there is on you," he said. He said some sort of clemency should be exercised. "He certainly shouldn't serve any less than five years, maybe 10. I hope that his behaviour and the fact he truly regrets what he did would be taken into account when the time comes," he said. Military commentator Colonel Mike Dewar said he was "horrified" by Marine A's actions but echoed calls for clemency, saying society had to make "exceptions for soldiers in extraordinary circumstances". "These soldiers have had their officer killed - their platoon commander, a very fine young man - they had seen their friends brutalised, lost legs, they had been under the pressures of battle for weeks and months," he said. But former Army Major Richard Streatfeild told the BBC it was too soon to tell what kind of sentence would be appropriate. "We don't know enough about his personal situation in terms of a plea of mitigation yet," he said. However, he said he agreed with Maj Gen Thompson about the "cumulative effect" war could have on members of the armed forces. It is the first time a member of the British forces has faced a murder charge in relation to the conflict in Afghanistan, which began in 2001. Two other marines were cleared after the trial at the Military Court Centre in Bulford, Wiltshire. An anonymity order was granted last year to protect the three men from possible reprisals. The murder took place after a patrol base in Helmand Province came under attack from small arms fire from two insurgents. The Afghan prisoner had been seriously injured by gunfire from an Apache helicopter sent to provide air support, and the marines found him in a field. One of the cleared marines - known as Marine B - inadvertently filmed the murder on his helmet-mounted camera and that footage, taken on 15 September 2011, was shown to the court during the two-week trial. It showed Marine A shooting the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol, and saying: "There, shuffle off this mortal coil... It's nothing you wouldn't do to us." He adds: "Obviously this doesn't go anywhere fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention," to which Marine B replies: "Yeah, roger mate." During the court martial, prosecutor David Perry told the court the murder was "not a killing in the heat and exercise of any armed conflict. It amounted to an execution". Marine A told the court martial he had fired because of "poor judgement and lack of self-control", but said he had thought the insurgent was already dead. Marines B and C were accused by the prosecution of being "party to the killing" and of having "encouraged and assisted" Marine A to commit the murder. At the time of the killing, Marine A was an experienced sergeant, Marine B was new to the Helmand base, while Marine C was the most junior of the three. </body>

      <title>Guardian to face MPs over NSA leaks</title>

      <body>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger is to be questioned by MPs over the newspaper's publication of leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden. Mr Rusbridger will give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee next month, a Guardian spokesman confirmed. The Guardian has published information about how British and US spy agencies monitor communications. The decision to publish the leaks was criticised by the leaders of UK security services on Thursday. Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought asylum - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. MI6 chief Sir John Sawers warned the Intelligence and Security Committee earlier this week that "our adversaries were rubbing their hands with glee, al-Qaeda is lapping it up" in the wake of the Snowden revelations, adding: "The leaks from Snowden have been very damaging, they've put our operations at risk". The Guardian, though, has defended its decision to publish the information, saying that the paper's coverage of British and US surveillance had prompted "necessary debate". On Friday, a spokesman said: "Alan has been invited to give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee and looks forward to appearing next month." Mr Sawers, along with the head of MI5 Andrew Parker and GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, were questioned by MPs in public after coming under pressure to be more open after the leaks by Mr Snowden revealed widespread spying by GCHQ and the US National Security Agency. Mr Parker argued that the security services defend, rather than undermine freedom, and pointed to 34 terror plots that had been disrupted by the security services since the terror attacks in London on 7 July 2005. News of Mr Rusbridger's appearance before the committee comes as Conservative MPs Julian Smith and Stephen Phillips called on him to clarify whether he had "acted on every security concern raised by government" over the news stories. They also asked him to confirm whether anyone at the Guardian had "directed, permitted, facilitated or acquiesced" in the transfer of the files obtained by Mr Snowden to anyone in the US or elsewhere. Mr Smith and Mr Phillips said Mr Rusbridger's response to a letter from 28 Tory MPs had failed to "acknowledge the devastating assessment of the damage done to the national security of the United Kingdom by the Guardian's reporting of the Snowden leaks", citing the evidence given by the security chiefs. They continued: "Secondly, it fails to address the question of whether you have acted on every security concern raised by government and whether the Government has felt that it had adequate time to respond to the matters which you have reported." </body>

      <title>Tory MPs rally behind EU vote plan</title>
      <description>Conservative MPs rally behind a bill promising an EU referendum by 2017 as Labour MPs try to derail it during a five-hour debate in the Commons.</description>

      <body>Conservative MPs have rallied behind a bill promising an EU referendum in the face of Labour attempts to derail it. Legislation urging a referendum by 2017 was discussed for five hours but no major votes were held and the debate was adjourned until later this month. Deputy PM Nick Clegg later criticised the Tories for "flirting" with an EU exit, while Labour MPs sought to delay the bill's passage through the Commons. But its sponsor, Tory MP James Wharton, said it had made "reasonable progress". The first in three days of detailed debate on Mr Wharton's bill concluded with Conservatives and Labour arguing over parliamentary tactics. In an effort to slow its progress, Labour MPs raised a host of related issues at length, including whether residents of Gibraltar and prisoners should be able to vote in a future referendum. Mr Cameron's referendum pledge, following a renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels, cannot be made law in the form of a coalition government bill because of Lib Dem opposition. "I think the Conservative Party is wrong to be flirting with exit from the European Union," Mr Clegg told the BBC. "Hundreds of thousands, millions of jobs depend on our place in what is the world's largest borderless single market." Tory backbencher Mr Wharton agreed to propose the legislation after he came top in a ballot of MPs private members' bill and many Tories pushed for the referendum commitment to be made binding before the 2015 general election. The bill has now reached its "report stage", where amendments can be discussed in detail. More than 50 amendments have been tabled, including 36 alone by Labour's Mike Gapes. Mr Gapes, who spoke for about an hour, defended his approach, saying the bill as it stood was "inadequate" and required "more proper consideration". His colleague Barry Sheerman said it was "furtive and unseemly" to have such an important constitutional matter considered via a private member's bill rather than through government legislation. And Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was not present for the debate, said the bill was an exercise in the "Conservative Party talking to itself". Mr Wharton told the BBC's Daily Politics his bill was making "reasonable progress" but acknowledged it was "going to be slow going". He said Labour and Lib Dem opponents wanted to delay the bill so it ran out of parliamentary time, adding: "We are going to do everything we can to stop that from happening". However, Conservative MP Adam Afriyie, has tabled an amendment calling for the referendum to happen in October next year instead - arguing that delaying a vote for four years will play into the hands of the UK Independence Party. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Afriyie likened the promise of a referendum to a "can that has been kicked down the road for generation after generation" and urged MPs to "settle the question now". "I ask a simple question," he said. "If not in this Parliament, when else can we be sure of securing a referendum...By chasing the EU referendum dream in 2017, we risk losing one in 2014 and throwing away the 2015 election." Asked about Mr Afriyie's amendment, Mr Wharton said: "One Conservative MP has said 'I think perhaps we should look at a different date' and what we have found in recent months is that there is not a lot of support for that." Private members' bills normally have little chance of becoming law due to lack of parliamentary time, unless they are backed by the government. But Mr Wharton's bill is being treated differently because David Cameron wants it to become law, to send a signal to his MPs and the public that he is serious about his commitment to hold a referendum. Tory MPs are under a "three line whip" to support the bill but few are speaking in Friday's debate amid concerns that this would limit the time for discussion and play into the hands of the bill's opponents. Foreign Secretary William Hague has written to all Conservatives to urge them to make their remarks "short and pithy". If it looks like the legislation will be "talked out" by opponents giving long speeches, Mr Wharton can ask for a "closure motion". If backed by a majority of MPs, numbering at least 100, this would allow the bill to be voted on as a whole. Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said Parliament was "only doing its job" by scrutinising the legislation, pointing out that the status of Gibraltar was highly significant and its omission from the bill was first raised by a Conservative. However, he acknowledged that opponents of the bill would not do themselves any favours by tabling "frivolous" amendments and Parliament must focus on the substance of the benefits of UK membership. UKIP, which has no representation in the Commons, urged MPs to back Mr Afriyie's call for the referendum to be brought forward. "I hope MPs do what's right, by voting to give the British people a say on the EU as soon as possible," the party's leader Nigel Farage said. If it makes it through the Commons, it will go to the Lords for further discussion in the next few months. </body>

      <title>Ministers to re-examine Living Fund</title>
      <description>Ministers will not be seeking leave to appeal after a decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund was overturned but will re-consider its future.</description>

      <body>The government will not be seeking leave to appeal after its decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund (ILF) was overturned in a court ruling. The £320m ILF currently provides support enabling nearly 19,000 severely disabled people in the UK to live independent lives in the community. The High Court ruled in April that the closure decision was lawful, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. The ILF will continue for now with ministers set to reconsider its future. The fund provides a ring-fenced budget for the independent living needs of severely disabled people. Last year the government decided to close it and devolve the funding to local authorities. That meant the money would no longer be ring-fenced, would be subject to normal budget cuts, and many disabled people feared that they would lose it. On Wednesday, the Court of Appeal quashed that decision, because it found that the government had not given proper consideration to issues raised by the Equality Act, which included the need to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people, and to encourage them to take part in a public life. The government said it would not appeal, but, in light of guidance provided by the Court of Appeal, ministers would be invited to make a new decision on its future based on further advice. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said the announcement meant that, for the time being, the fund remains intact and in business. Campaigners are now urging the government to secure the fund's long-term future, he added. A statement from anti-austerity group Disabled People Against Cuts, whose members took the case to court, said: "We all owe a great debt of gratitude to the five ILF users that took this to the courts and the solicitors and barristers who worked tirelessly. "It has proved that disabled people can and will fight back. It has proved that disabled people can win." The Department for Work and Pensions said: "This government is absolutely committed to supporting disabled people and we continue to spend around £50bn a year on disabled people and their services." </body>

      <description>Former BBC political editor John Cole has died aged 85, his family says</description>

      <body>Former BBC political editor John Cole has died aged 85. Cole was the BBC's chief reporter during the Thatcher era, and covered major stories including the miners' strike and the Brighton bombing. "While many people will remember John for his journalism and broadcasting, for us he was the most loving, funny and devoted husband, father and grandfather," his family said. Cole, who retired in 1992, died in his sleep at home in Surrey. He was surrounded by his family, who said: "We will miss him terribly." He is survived by his wife Madge, four sons - Donald, Patrick, David and Michael - and nine grandchildren, who acknowledged the "many memories of the tremendous happiness he has brought into our lives". Born in Belfast in 1927, he began his writing career at the local Belfast Telegraph at the age of just 17. He went on to work at both the Guardian and the Observer, before succeeding John Simpson to the role of political editor at the BBC in 1981. Current BBC political editor Nick Robinson tweeted: "Sad news. The man I learnt so much from, the BBC's former Political Editor John Cole, has died. He shaped the way all in my trade do our jobs." The BBC's Mark Simpson called him "a journalistic legend". With his incisive interview style and distinctive accent, Cole was immortalised by a Spitting Image puppet, cementing his status as a household name. He was presented with the Royal Television Society's Journalist of the Year award in 1991 and Bafta's Richard Dimbleby Award in 1993. Following mandatory retirement after the 1992 general election - having reached the age of 65 - he continued to work at the corporation on a freelance basis for many years. He also wrote a collection of political memoirs entitled As It Seemed To Me, and a novel, A Clouded Peace. BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said he had covered "an extraordinary era". "He was somebody who really brought it to life and who really knew what was going on behind the scenes," she told BBC News. "He was a hard-working journalist... always there at the right place and the right time." A spokesman for David Cameron said the prime minister was "deeply saddened by the news and sends his condolences to Mr Cole's family", adding that he had "contributed so much to British political life". Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted that he "grew up watching John Cole". "He conveyed the drama and importance of politics," he added. "Many condolences to his family." The BBC's head of news, James Harding, said: "John was a loved and respected broadcaster, a journalist with his own unforgettable style and a commanding knowledge of his subject. "He embodied the qualities of a truly great journalist: integrity, curiosity and character. He will, I know, be sorely missed and fondly remembered across the BBC." He added: "Our thoughts are with his family". Fellow journalist David Aaronovitch tweeted: "Farewell John Cole. I worked with him for several years at the BBC and he was a lovely, wise (though engagingly irascible) man." The former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine said Cole's success involved a "great deal of charm". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, he said: "John became a national character. I think the accent was a great help, didn't do him any harm at all, everybody knew who he was. "I look back with great fondness to my relationship with him." </body>

      <title>Cut royal travel budget says peer</title>
      <description>Labour peer Lord Berkeley calls for cut to royal travel budget - and for wealth generated by Prince Charles's private estate to be handed to the people of Cornwall.</description>

      <body>Fewer members of the Royal Family should be entitled to taxpayer-funded travel, according to a Labour peer. Lord Berkeley singled out Princess Anne for criticism over her use of the royal helicopter to visit horse shows. He also called on Prince Charles to hand over the Duchy of Cornwall's assets to the county's residents. Cabinet Office Minister Lord Wallace of Saltaire accused him of getting "fairly personal" and said the Queen was the best judge of royal transport use. Government spending on the monarchy rose by almost £1m to £33.3m in the last financial year, but the overall cost of official air and rail travel at home and abroad fell by £500,000 to £4.5m. Lord Berkeley, a former opposition whip, said royal travel arrangements seemed to have become "open-ended" with no "proper independent scrutiny", adding this "obsequiousness" needed to change. Turning to Princess Anne's arrangements, he said: "I noted that she took a helicopter to visit two gymkhanas in one day. It is fun if you are horsey, but is it really necessary for the taxpayer to pay for it?" He added: "I believe that the royal travel arrangements, if funded by the taxpayer, should be scrutinised by Parliament in the same way as ministers' travel." Lord Berkeley's Rights of the Sovereign and Duchy of Cornwall Bill stands no chance of becoming law without government backing but he has written to Prince Charles to ask for his views on the proposal. The bill would amend the structure of the Duchy of Cornwall - one of the largest private estates in Britain, owning 120,000 acres of land, including 2% of Cornwall and most of the Scilly Isles - to become a public trust for the benefit of the people of Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. "My bill would ensure that the Prince of Wales would no longer be king of Cornwall in the feudal sense," Lord Berkeley said in the House of Lords. "I think he should retain links with Cornwall, as he does with Wales, but he doesn't own Wales." Conservative peer Lord Cormack, opposing the "hasty and ill-considered" bill, accused the Labour peer of "niggardly nit-picking". He said the Royal Family gave "unstinting public service" and their presence at public events was greatly appreciated. Liberal Democrat Lord Teverson, a resident of Cornwall, said some aspects of the bill were well worth pursuing and would strengthen the monarchy. But Liberal Democrat Cabinet Office minister Lord Wallace said the Queen asked a number of members of her family to stand in on her behalf and they carried out a large number of public duties. "The Sovereign is well placed to assess who can best take her place at functions." He said the Prince of Wales, who holds the title the Duke of Cornwall, chose to use a substantial portion of his income from the Duchy, which totalled £19.1m in 2012-13, to meet the cost of his public and charitable work. The bill's proposal to place the assets of the Duchy in a public trust was an unacceptable encroachment on private property rights as currently established, he told peers. Lord Berkeley's bill would also remove the right of the Sovereign and Prince of Wales to give prior approval or not to legislation which affects their "private interest". In 2011, the peer sponsored a bill on marine navigation but was told it needed Prince Charles's consent because it affected the Duchy. Lord Berkeley, who is chairman of the Rail Freight Group, inherited his title but was granted a life peerage by Tony Blair in 2000 to enable him to continue sitting in the Lords when most hereditary peers were abolished. </body>

      <title>MPs attack immigration removal rate</title>
      <description>MPs call for "effective action" against illegal immigration, saying only 1.5% of allegations result in a person being removed from the UK.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24858574</url>

      <body>Only 1.5% of reports alleging illegal immigration result in a person being removed from the UK, MPs have said. The Home Affairs Committee also said the now-defunct UK Border Agency had a backlog of 432,029 immigration and asylum cases when it was scrapped at the end of March. Its chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, urged the coalition to take "effective action" to amend a "poor record". The government responded that it was "getting tough" on illegal immigration. The committee looked at the allegations database set up by the UKBA to follow up tip-offs by the public. It replaced a system where allegations and removals were held separately. It revealed that about 6% of claims had led to an investigation and 1.5% had resulted in removals. The committee said it was "extremely concerned about the number of allegations that are made to the Allegations Management System that are not investigated. "We recommend that all allegations are actioned and checked against national databases. It is incomprehensible that only 1.5 in 100 reports of illegal immigration result in someone being removed from the country." Mr Vaz said there was a "very poor record" on removals, which did "not give confidence to those who go out of their way to help the Home Office". The committee's report revealed that between its introduction on 30 September last year and 30 June this year, the database had received 48,660 allegations - about 178 a day. It said the rates of investigation and removal risked undermining confidence in the system and "could lead to reluctance to report such allegations if the public perceive that no action is being taken". The MPs recommended that those who made allegations of illegal immigration be told the outcome of investigations, in an effort to improve public confidence. After a series of damning reports, Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UKBA and replaced it with UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which were brought back under the control of ministers. "There are still over 430,000 cases languishing in the backlogs, enough to fill Wembley Stadium almost five times over," Mr Vaz went on. "As we have said on numerous occasions, the backlogs must be cleared as a matter of priority. Only then will the Home Office be able to tackle the deeper problems in the immigration system." Immigration minister Mark Harper said: "The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since its formation in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. That is why we split the agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates." He added: "Our newly created UK Visa and Immigration directorate is focused on delivering a high-volume, high-quality visa service, while Immigration Enforcement is getting tough on those who break our immigration laws." Mr Harper also said: "We are building an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010." But Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said the committee's "damning report" shows that "for all the rhetoric Theresa May's Home Office is failing badly in tackling illegal immigration, backlogs of cases, and can only show progress by sleight of hand. "This out of touch government's response to real challenges has been to use taxpayers' money on ineffective and offensive gimmicks like the ad vans and 'go home' texts." He added: "The home secretary urgently needs to get a grip on the shambolic performance of the Home Office and make sure people are removed when they shouldn't be here, and sort out the backlogs that are increasing on her watch." Under plans announced by the Home office last month, landlords would be asked to check the immigration status of their tenants. There would also be new powers to check driving licence applicants' immigration status and a reduction in the number of grounds for appeal against deportation decisions from 17 to four. </body>

      <title>Iran talks to resume for third day</title>
      <description>Talks in Geneva on Iran's nuclear programme are to resume on Saturday, as President Obama telephones the Israeli PM to allay fears over any deal.</description>

      <body>Talks in Geneva on Iran's nuclear programme are to resume on Saturday, after Friday's discussions ended late in the evening. Earlier US Secretary of State John Kerry said there were still "important gaps" between Iran and world powers. Meanwhile, President Obama telephoned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to allay fears over any deal. Under a deal being floated, Iran could freeze expansion of its nuclear activity for limited sanctions relief. "It was productive but still we have lots of work to do," Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters late on Friday. For his part, Mr Kerry commented "we're working hard," as he returned to his hotel at the end of the evening. A White House statement said Mr Obama had updated the Israeli leader on the talks in Geneva, and repeated his commitment to stopping Tehran getting a nuclear weapon. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had earlier said he "utterly rejected" such a deal with Iran, its long-time enemy, and that his country would not be obliged to abide by it. The West has suspected Iran's uranium enrichment programme is a step towards building nuclear weapons - a charge Iran strongly denies. The talks of Friday ended after Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif held a five-hour meeting with top EU diplomat Catherine Ashton and Mr Kerry. UK, French and German foreign ministers also joined the unscheduled talks with Iranian representatives in Geneva. Russia's Sergei Lavrov had not been scheduled to attend but sources say he will travel to Geneva on Saturday. For the first time in years, talks about Iran's nuclear programme are moving fast, the BBC's James Reynolds reports from Geneva. The negotiations have also picked up new, critical purpose, he says - a chance for the US and Iran to explore an end to their three decades of mistrust. However, although the sides appear closer to a breakthrough than during previous talks, the outcome still remains uncertain. Mr Kerry interrupted the itinerary of his tour to the Middle East and North Africa to fly to Geneva after meeting Mr Netanyahu in Jerusalem. The US state department also said that Mr Kerry would not now make planned stops in Algeria or Morocco. On arrival, Mr Kerry said: "[We] hope to try to narrow the differences but no-one should mistake that there are important gaps to be closed." The Geneva talks involve the P5+1: the US, Russia, the UK, France and China as permanent UN Security Council members, plus Germany. The French, German and UK Foreign Ministers - Laurent Fabius, Guido Westerwelle and William Hague - are also in Geneva. Mr Fabius said there had been progress but nothing "hard and fast". Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Moscow hoped the talks would produce a "lasting result the entire world has been waiting for". Friday prayer leaders across Iran urged the public to support the country's nuclear delegation as it negotiated "from a position of strength and with dignity". Mr Zarif said on Friday there was "the general outline of an agreement". Although details of the suggested deal have not been disclosed, it is thought to offer Iran a gradual easing of sanctions in return for a freeze on expansion of nuclear activities. The Israeli prime minister argued the Iranians were getting sanctions relief while "not reducing in any way their nuclear enrichment capability". Israel, Mr Netanyahu said, would do "everything it needs to do to defend itself and the security of its people". He has said Israel is committed to making sure Tehran never gets a nuclear weapon. Defence analysts have speculated the Israelis may take military action to disrupt Iran's programme. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that any criticism of a deal was "premature". "There is no deal, but there is an opportunity here for a possible diplomatic solution, and that is exactly what [President Obama] is pursuing," he said. Since 2006 the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions - including asset freezes and travel bans - on entities and people involved in Iran's nuclear programme. Separate US and EU sanctions have targeted Iran's energy and banking sectors, crippling its oil-based economy. The head of the UN atomic watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, Yukiya Amano, is travelling to Tehran on Monday to meet senior Iranian figures. </body>

      <body>An independent review has recommended a series of changes to the Riot Damages Act in the wake of the riots that affected areas across England in 2011. It examined compensation arrangements for those caught up in a riot. It was commissioned by the home secretary and will go out to consultation. The original act was drawn up in Victorian times, making no allowances for damage to cars and other vehicles. Independent reviewer Neil Kinghan said it was "well overdue for reform". In his report, Mr Kinghan said the claims process needed to be faster and more efficient to ensure that smaller businesses were given the help they needed to get back on their feet quickly. Also tasked with reviewing the definition of a riot and who should be liable, Mr Kinghan recommended that police continued to be liable. Under the current Riot Damages Act of 1886, people who suffer loss or damages during a riot must claim compensation from the local police budget. Following the riots of August 2011, police were inundated with claims and insurers estimated clean-up costs would reach £200m. The riots started in London after the fatal shooting of Mark Duggan by police, and then spread to other towns and cities. Mr Kinghan said: "During my review I met a wide range of people affected by the riots and it was clear that whilst central and local government did their best, they were hampered by a lack of preparedness, both for the riots themselves and for the demands for compensation they generated. "I was pleased to be given the opportunity to work on this review and I hope that government will carefully consider my recommendations." His review also recommended that in the event of widespread riots a "riot claims bureau" staffed by experts should be set up to manage claims. He also recommended modernising the language of the act and capping the amount of compensation that can be provided to insurers. Justice Minister Damian Green said it was a "very thoughtful and constructive" report. He added: "The riots that raged in London two years ago were utterly disgraceful. The wanton and widespread criminality caused enormous distress to a great many people and businesses. "The measures in the Riot Damages Act provide a safety net but they have to be efficient and provide value for money for the taxpayer." The government plans to launch a public consultation by the end of the year. </body>

      <body>Labour MP Shaun Woodward, who became a cabinet minister after defecting from the Conservatives, is to stand down at the next general election. Mr Woodward, who enjoyed a majority of more than 14,000 in St Helen's South and Whiston at the last election, switched to Labour in 1999. He eventually became Northern Ireland Secretary under Gordon Brown. Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Woodard had served with "great distinction" as an MP and minister. Mr Miliband said the MP's defection had taken "personal courage and political commitment" and that Labour would "be forever grateful to you". Writing to confirm his resignation, Mr Woodward said he would focus on human rights issues after leaving Parliament. Mr Woodward was elected as Tory MP for Witney in Oxfordshire in 1997, but quit the seat after one parliamentary term. While David Cameron succeeded him as Witney's Tory MP, Mr Woodward went on to win St Helen's South and Whiston, in Merseyside, one of Labour's strongholds, at the 2001 general election. Mr Woodward had fallen out with the Conservative leadership after backing the repeal of Clause 28, which banned councils and schools in England and Wales from intentionally promoting homosexuality. He is married to Sainsbury's heiress Camilla Sainsbury, daughter of the former Conservative MP Tim Sainsbury. A Cambridge graduate, Mr Woodward worked as a researcher and programme editor at the BBC and as head of press for the Conservatives before entering politics. </body>

      <title>MSPs endorse gay marriage bill</title>
      <description>Legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland is backed by the Holyrood committee looking into the proposals.</description>

      <body>Legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland has been backed by the Holyrood committee looking into the proposals. Most MSPs on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill. But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic Church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, said: "All of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. "While the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the Scottish Parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience." The Bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration. Tom French, of the Equality Network charity, said backing the Bill would help remove discrimination from law. "With just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage Bill, we urge MSPs to stand up for a fairer and more equal Scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support," he said. "The large majority of people in Scotland believe it's time LGBT people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This Bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are." But campaign group Scotland for Marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it. A spokesman said: "The Scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. "Real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of Scots who don't support this law. "No one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected." In England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act was passed into law in July. It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place. The act will allow religious organisations to "opt in" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so. </body>

      <title>We defend freedom - UK spy chiefs</title>
      <description>Britain's security services defend "freedom and democracy", the head of MI5 tells MPs and peers in the first public grilling of the UK's top spies.</description>

      <body>Britain's security services defend - rather than undermine - freedom and democracy, the head of MI5 has said. Andrew Parker was being grilled alongside GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers in an unprecedented public hearing. He said 34 terror plots had been disrupted since the 7 July, 2005, attacks in London. The three men were quizzed on the work of their organisations by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The committee of MPs and peers normally takes evidence from the security chiefs in secret. But they have been under pressure to be more open after leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying by GCHQ and the US National Security Agency. MI6 chief Sir John Sawers warned the politicians that "our adversaries were rubbing their hands with glee, al Qaeda is lapping it up" in the wake of the Snowden revelations, adding: "The leaks from Snowden have been very damaging, they've put our operations at risk". GCHQ chief Sir Iain Lobban said activists in the Middle East and "closer to home" had been monitored discussing ways of switching away from communications they "now perceived as vulnerable". He also suggested the leaks could help paedophiles avoid detection, and said the success of intelligence operations required the country's enemies to be "unaware or uncertain" of methods. The Intelligence and Security Committee has already carried out a limited investigation into claims that GCHQ used the American National Security Agency's vast Prism programme, which gathers information from internet companies, to circumvent UK laws. Sir Iain was asked about these claims, but said his agency acted within the law and rejected the idea that they were involved in widespread snooping. He said: "We do not spend our time listening to the telephone calls or reading the emails of the majority. That would not be proportionate, that would not be legal, and we would not do it." He said the type of people employed by GCHQ were focused on combating terrorism and criminals and would "walk out" if they were asked to spy on innocent people. Andrew Parker, who handles agents within the UK, told the committee a total of 34 terror plots had been foiled since 2005 including "one or two" plots aimed at causing mass casualties. Most had been foiled as result of the intervention of the police and security services. He said MI5 was aware of "several thousand individuals in this country who I would describe as supporting violent extremism or are engaged in it" and "almost all" of the plots had involved some of "these people". He also warned about the growth of "terrorist tourism", where British nationals travel abroad for training before return to the UK to plot attacks, with the civil war in Syria currently proving a magnet for those seeking "jihadi" activity among groups linked to al Qaeda. Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind began the 90 minute hearing - televised with a two-minute time delay to prevent the inadvertent release of sensitive secrets - by saying it was a "very significant step forward in the transparency of our intelligence agencies". The agency chiefs explained what they saw their role as in a post-Cold War world and whether they were worth the £2bn in taxpayer money they receive each year. Mr Parker, who took over as head of MI5 earlier this year, said it was a "proportionate investment against the threats the country faces". Responding to concerns raised by leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden, he said: "The suggestion that what we do is somehow compromising freedom and democracy - of course we believe the opposite to be the case. "The work we do is addressing directly threats to this country, to our way of life and to the people who live here." MI6 chief Sir John Sawers was quizzed about why the security services had failed to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and the Arab Spring. He said that was not their job, telling the committee: "We acquire the secrets that other countries don't want us to know... we are not all-knowing specialists in what's going to happen next month or next year." Both he and Mr Parker stressed that they would never condone or be complicit in the torture of terror suspects, but Sir John admitted the security services were not adequately resourced or trained to cope with the scale of the terror threat in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. "It took us some time to adapt to the scale of the threat we faced," he told the committee, but they had "learned a huge amount over the last 12 years" and he was "satisfied" with the "rigorous compliance procedures now in place". Sir John, whose agency runs spying operations around the world, said agents in the field did not operate in isolation "like James Bond" and there was round-the-clock support available to them if they needed it. "We have a system to enable guidance to be issued from head office and if we don't feel clearly enough it falls one side of the line or the other - or the facts are just uncertain - then we will wake the foreign secretary up and ask him for a view one way or the other." Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought sanctuary from the US - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. Although the committee cleared the agency of any wrongdoing in the 197 specific intelligence reports it looked at, it is now undertaking a wider inquiry into whether the laws governing surveillance are adequate for the internet age. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web, has said encryption cracking by UK and US spy agencies is "appalling and foolish". Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who worked with Mr Snowden on stories for the Guardian about spying by the National Security Agency and GCHQ, said the Parliamentary system had, so far, failed to hold Britain's intelligence agencies to account. "There was a huge suspicion-less system of mass spying that the British people and the American people had no idea had been built in their name and with their money," he said. But he added: "I believe that that system can bring about real accountability if there's the political will." Sir David Ormand, former head of GCHQ, earlier defended the closeness of Britain's intelligence relationship with the US, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We have the brains. They have the money. It's a collaboration that's worked very well." Asked why there had been such a fierce debate about the Communications Data Bill, dubbed the "snooper's charter" by critics, when GCHQ was already gathering large quantities of data covertly, he said the agency was "primarily a foreign intelligence agency" and the proposed legislation concerned British data. He added: "You shouldn't be looking to GCHQ to provide what can very much more cheaply and easily provided by the internet service providers. That requires legislation and Parliament got itself in a bit of a tangle over the details of that legislation." Sir David also dismissed Sir Tim Berners-Lee's criticisms, telling BBC Breakfast he thought the scientist was "probably exaggerating for effect, in order to get his point across and fire a shot across the bows of the intelligence agencies". </body>

      <body>SDLP leader Alasdair McDonnell has told his party conference in Armagh people feel let down by the DUP and Sinn Féin. He told delegates the DUP and Sinn Féin "are the parties of disappointment, false promise, poor government, bad politics and no results". "They have had their chance and they have failed the test," Dr McDonnell said. He said SDLP ministers, MLAs and MPs had challenged and faced down the "bad politics" of the DUP and Sinn Féin. "Politics have to deliver results for everybody, particularly ordinary hard-working families," Dr McDonnell said. "I believe that our SDLP core values are central to rebuilding faith in politics, and trust in politicians and delivering worthwhile benefits. "Those core values are: Reconciliation, social justice and prosperity. "The many broken promises in the programme for government show the disappointing failure of the DUP and Sinn Féin, including the failure to get to grips with a shared future, collusion issues, real power sharing and integration." The SDLP leader said for much of the past year "riots and mayhem" had dominated the headlines in Northern Ireland. "Hundreds of courageous PSNI officers; holding the line, have been injured, the police have been stretched to breaking point and the economy of Belfast has been severely damaged," he said. "Last December, Belfast City Council arrived at a sensible compromise, to fly the union flag on designated days, a decision that was supported by the SDLP. "It is unfortunate that unionists cannot do compromise." He said the party believed Northern Ireland needed a formal prosperity process, pursued with the same ambition and determination as the peace process. "Indeed 15 years ago many of us expected a prosperity process; a mini Marshall Plan; to be constructed to underpin the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement," he said. "There were promises - hopes were raised; and hopes were dashed." Dr McDonnell concluded his speech by saying that he had a dream for the future of Ireland. "I have a dream of a new and much better Ireland where our vision and all our hopes and ambitions for peace, reconciliation, social justice and economic prosperity are finally realised; a new Ireland taking her place proudly in a brave new world at the heart of Europe and where we are at peace with ourselves and with Britain," he said. "We in the SDLP are determined to ensure that we empower you to realise your dreams, hopes and ambitions both for yourselves and for your families." </body>

      <title>Labour MSP Helen Eadie dies, aged 66</title>
      <description>Labour MSP Helen Eadie, who was being treated for cancer at a hospice in Dunfermline, dies at the age of 66.</description>

      <body>Labour MSP Helen Eadie has died at the age of 66. It emerged earlier this week that she had cancer and was in a hospice at Queen Margaret Hospital, in Dunfermline. She had been a Labour MSP since the parliament was established in 1999, as the member for Dunfermline East, and later as MSP for Cowdenbeath, following boundary changes. She was diagnosed with her illness at the end of October. She leaves a husband Bob and two daughters. Scottish Labour Leader Johann Lamont said she was deeply saddened to hear of Mrs Eadie's death and described her as a "politician of tremendous passion and commitment". She said: "Helen was very precious to her family. She played an important part in helping to establish the credibility of Holyrood. "She will also be fondly remembered within the Scottish co-operative movement. Her commitment to delivering change in our communities was the essence of her political beliefs and values." "She was her own woman who didn't fit the political stereotype. Perhaps that's why some underestimated her, but her difference was why she was admired by the people of her constituency. "She will be missed by many and will be remembered across her constituency in standing up for their needs and concerns." She added: "My thoughts and those of the whole Scottish Labour movement will be with Helen's family at this difficult time." Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who is the MP for Cowdenbeath, described Mrs Eadie as a "passionate champion of social justice". He said: "The whole of Fife is mourning the sudden and very sad death of our popular Member of the Scottish Parliament, Helen Eadie. "Much loved and well respected throughout the county, Helen Eadie has spent her working life serving the people of Fife. "Having spent many years as a Fife councillor Helen became, in 1999, the first member of the Scottish Parliament to be elected for the Dunfermline East and Cowdenbeath constituency, an area which she has represented with great distinction for 14 years." First Minister Alex Salmond said: "My sincere condolences go to Helen Eadie's family, friends and colleagues. Helen served the people she represented diligently over the years, first as a Fife councillor and then as MSP for Dunfermline East and Cowdenbeath. "Helen was also one of the Scottish Parliament's original MSPs first elected in 1999, and that unbroken 14-year period at Holyrood is a not inconsiderable record of public service of which her family can be rightly proud." Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats and MSP for Mid Scotland and Fife, said: "As fellow parliamentarians for West Fife, Helen's intense, burning commitment to socialism was inspiring to observe. "Although a gentle and kind lady, you did not cross Helen without suffering from the sharp end of her tongue. "Helen made waves for her causes and her constituents." Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson MSP said: "Helen was a committed parliamentarian and a true servant to her constituents in Fife. "She was a wonderful, warm-hearted woman who would always go the extra mile to help someone out. "She had friends across all parties, and Scottish politics is poorer for her passing." Former First Minister Henry McLeish, who served with Mrs Eadie on Fife Council in the 1980s, said: "This is a sad loss for Fife. She was always a courageous, defiant and independent advocate for her constituents which is the highest compliment that can be paid to an elected representative." Mrs Eadie recently campaigned in Labour's successful bid to win the Dunfermline by-election. She has a union background and joined Labour in the 1960s, holding a number of posts in the party before life as an elected member beckoned. She served on various Scottish Parliament committees over the years, but in June 2007 resigned her membership of two of them in protest at the Conservatives being given convenership of the equal opportunities committee. At the time Mrs Eadie said the move was like "putting Attila the Hun in charge of care in the community". In November 2006 Mrs Eadie called for curfews for people under the age of 15, after she was trapped in her car by a gang of youngsters. While looking into concerns from constituents about youth-related anti-social behaviour, she was surrounded by a mob in Cowdenbeath who started rocking the car and throwing missiles at it. As a Fife MSP, Mrs Eadie called for an end to tolls on the Forth Road Bridge, during Labour's time in power. In 2003, Mrs Eadie was the Labour group's most outspoken opponent to the then Labour/Lib Dem coalition's plan to introduce proportional representation (PR) in council elections. Voting reform was a key part of the partnership agreement struck between Labour and the Liberal Democrats after the May election, but Mrs Eadie said it was an example of "the tail wagging the dog". She said at the time: "It's about one of the smallest parties in the parliament wanting to use the power that they have to try to force through issues that they want to see steamrollered through." </body>

      <title>800 nursing home beds disappear</title>
      <description>Almost 800 nursing home beds close in Wales over the past four years as homes struggle with recruitment and rising costs.</description>

      <body>Almost 800 nursing home beds have been closed in Wales over the past four years, according to figures obtained by BBC Wales. It is claimed this has left families of sick, older residents struggling to find a new home for loved ones. There are warnings that more homes in Wales could close, as they struggle with recruitment and rising costs. The Welsh government said it had plans for a £50m care fund to support people to remain in their own homes. According to a Care Forum Wales survey, due to be released on Monday, a third of Welsh nursing home owners do not think they will be in business in five years' time. And three-quarters of their members are struggling with recruitment difficulties and rising costs. Sarah Rochira, the Older People's Commissioner for Wales, told BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye on Wales that she had heard from families across Wales struggling to find nursing home places for their relatives. She has written to all Welsh health boards and local authorities to ask them what they are doing to ensure they have sufficient provision for the future. "The reality is we are an ageing population and that does mean that we are going to see an increased need for specialist services and support," she said. "I'm not convinced yet that we are in a position where we can assure older people that in years to come they will get the support they need. "And certainly the evidence that people are raising with me seems to show that too many older people at the moment are beginning to struggle to get the support they need." Mario Kreft, director of Care Forum Wales, said the fees paid by health boards and local authorities for publicly-funded residents did not cover the costs. "Nobody in our view is really understanding the value of all the small and medium enterprises which, taken together, provide over 11,000 beds registered for nursing care - and that's nearly as many beds as we have in the NHS," he said. The figures on nursing home beds were released following a freedom of information request from Eye on Wales to Care and Social Services Inspectorate Wales. It showed that 254 adult care nursing home beds had been lost in the last year alone. Kerry Hagland is desperately looking for a nursing home for her 82-year-old father Patrick Lynch, who suffers from dementia, arthritis, osteoporosis and kidney failure. He needs nursing care and lives at St Dunstan's Nursing Home in Griffithstown, near Pontypool, Torfaen. But now its owners, HC-One, are closing it down leaving Ms Hagland and her 82-year-old mother Sylvia devastated. "It's a lovely place. We knew that the home had a few problems with staffing issues, but it was a shock when they said they were closing it," Ms Hagland said. "Dad needs nursing for his health and the understanding that he has dementia. "There are no places in Torfaen for him whatsoever. He's got to wait for someone to pass away so he can have their place. "Six that have actually been moved have already passed away - that's a concern for me because if I move my father, what state is he going to be in?" A spokesperson for the home said: "As part of our jointly agreed closure plan with Torfaen, a policy was put in place for any resident admitted to hospital to move directly from there to a new home to avoid multiple moves. "HC-One's managing director met with Torfaen on Friday to ensure suitable new homes for Mr Lynch and the few remaining residents at St Dunstan's are found quickly to minimise stress." Both Torfaen council and Aneurin Bevan Health Board said they were working together to find appropriate alternative placements for all residents at St Dunstan's. They said all local nursing homes had been contacted to secure any vacancies that become available for residents needing to transfer. In a statement, the Welsh government said it "recognises the pressures of caring for an increasing number of older people with complex needs". Its draft budget for 2014-15 includes plans for a £50m intermediate care fund to support people to remain in their own home, as well as ensuring beds are available for those people who really need them. Eye on Wales is on BBC Radio Wales on Sunday, 10 November at 13:30 GMT. </body>

      <title>Lords quiz energy firms over fracking</title>
      <description>The four bosses of the energy firms hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling give evidence to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee.</description>

      <body>The four bosses of companies hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling in the UK have given evidence to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, IGas Energy CEO Andrew Austin, Tom Crotty, director of INEO, and INEOS gas procurement manager Andrew Mackenzie were questioned on the scope for commercial shale gas extraction by peers on Tuesday. They were also asked which areas were most likely to produce shale gas, and when production might start. Andrew Austin was up first. He said they knew there was an awful lot of gas out there but what they needed to know was whether they could technically recover it and if it could be economical. Then it was the turn of Francis Egan of Cuadrilla. Quietly spoken and calm, you could sense his frustration that, as he put it, the difference between exploration and exploitation was not well understood. He repeatedly said they had not drilled shale at the Balcombe site in West Sussex and no hydraulic fracturing - fracking - had taken place either. Asked if he "could put his hand on his heart and say fracking is completely safe?", he said yes without any hesitation. He also said he could categorically say there was no correlation between fracking and cancers, which was one of the scare stories he'd heard. The point all four made was that the level of scrutiny on shale gas exploration was much higher than for tradition oil and gas and they thought the government needed to help sell the benefits - such as the potential to create anywhere between 25,000 and 100,000 jobs. They said there was the potential to create "another Aberdeen" - potentially in the North West of the country. After the hearing I spoke to the committee chair, Lord McGregor. He was at pains to point out they were not even half way through the inquiry process but said he thought the bosses had made a good case. Lord McGregor also cited the example of the US, where fracking has helped transform the economy and lower utility bills; the energy bosses gave no such assurances on utility bills. Mr Egan said he'd worked in oil and gas all his life and had "never seen an accurate oil price forecast" because the price was controlled by supply and demand. He also said if they didn't explore shale gas and oil opportunities everyone would have to pay higher prices for imported fuel eventually. The bosses estimate the UK's oil and gas is due to run out by about 2030, with Britain then being forced to import supplies from Russia or China at potentially much higher costs and with greater security risks. While the bosses calmly gave evidence to the committee, the No Fracking in Balcombe Society was among a group of campaigners delivering an open letter to the prime minister. They want the government to compensate communities for any fall in house prices or tourism resulting from fracking, and any environmental fallout that affects industries such as farming. The contrast between the way the two groups delivered their arguments brings into sharp focus the deep divisions on both sides of this debate - the need to keep the lights on weighed against the need to protect the environment. Despite the weeks of protests in Balcombe this summer, the energy bosses seemed optimistic the public mood would turn in their favour. Mr Egan said his firm could start drilling tomorrow if it had planning permission. This debate still has some way to go. Next up in front of the committee will be representatives of the Environment Agency and government ministers.

      <title>City's shipbuilding loss 'a tragedy'</title>
      <description>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose shipbuilding has been described as a "catastrophe".</description>

      <body>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose its shipbuilding industry has been described as a "catastrophe". About 900 job losses are expected at the BAE yard, which employs about 1,200 people. The site will stay open, with a focus on repairs and maintenance, but there is no prospect of new ships. For the south coast port, which considers itself the home of the Royal Navy, it is a big blow. The city's maritime links are clear for any visitor to see. Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose, HMS Victory, from which Admiral Nelson commanded victory at the Battle of Trafalgar and the battleship HMS Warrior are proudly displayed in the city's dockyard. The Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers will be based at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard - which was under threat a few years ago. Losing shipbuilding will be felt far and wide across the Solent region. Many workers said they had been "forbidden" to speak to the media as they left the Portsmouth yard following the announcement. But one, who did not want to be named, described a "bad mood" among staff. "Basically there's about six months work left," he said. "It's not really unexpected, we knew it was coming." Another added: "It's a sad day for the loss of work in the South yet again. "[It's] a political decision for Scotland to have all the work and us have nothing." The mood in Portsmouth earlier matched those of the workers. Derek Brown, who started 40 years of work as a shipwright when he was 15, said: "For years it's been run down but it's unfortunate a lot of people will lose their jobs - people with mortgages and bills to pay. "When I first went in there was 22,000 people working in there. It was a job for life then but times change." Patricia Hawkins added: "Portsmouth will be a ghost town. We'll end up with a museum not a dockyard and what happens when we need ships to go to war again?" Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said the news was a "personal tragedy for everyone who's going into work in the yard today". He added: "And that's a personal tragedy for them and a catastrophe for the city of Portsmouth to lose so many highly-skilled jobs which will be virtually impossible to replace in that line. "I think it's a national disgrace that we're going put all their expertise and investment that's gone into the yard in Portsmouth at risk by closing it down and putting all your eggs into one basket." Ian Woodland, South East regional officer for the Unite union, said the news means skilled workers will be left on the "scrap heap". "[The] Tories are clueless about how to deal with BAE job losses in Portsmouth. Where will these people work?," he said. "There are no jobs for these workers. "BAE job losses in Portsmouth will affect [the] whole of Solent area. Many BAE employees [also] live in Southampton." Maureen Frost, executive director of Hampshire Chamber of Commerce, said it would be working with the city council to try and help those affected. "Losing the shipbuilding side is devastating news for the city," she added. "It's also about the supply chain and those small businesses that supply into BAE Systems so there's going to be a major impact. "It may not just be one person in one family, with the tradition of shipbuilding here sometimes it's the whole family involved." BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago when it became apparent that future work, following the completion of the new aircraft carriers, was unlikely to sustain yards in Portsmouth as well as Govan and Scotstoun in Scotland. And it is Portsmouth that will make way. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>Alistair McGowan headed to the allotments to explain why his favourite thinker is the green economist E F Schumacher, who is best known for his 1973 book Small Is Beautiful. The impressionist, actor, and environmentalist said the German's book was still relevant 40 years on: "People thought he was ahead of his time then, but actually we are still catching up with theories now." This is the second in a Daily Politics series on political thinkers and their ideologies, which will run most Fridays in the coming months.

      <body>Conservative MP James Wharton said his bill was the "best chance of delivering a referendum" on Britain's membership of the EU. MPs have tabled a series of amendments to the bill, including one asking whether residents of Gibraltar and prisoners should be able to vote in a referendum, and another by Tory backbencher Adam Afriyie calling for a vote to be held before 2015. Lib Dem MP Martin Horwood said his party was "not afraid of a referendum" as the pair spoke to Andrew Neil on BBC2's Daily Politics. Mr Wharton's bid for a referendum by 2017 is backed by David Cameron, but opposed by his deputy Nick Clegg and opposition leader Ed Miliband.

      <body>No politician has got to grips with the "biggest problem of all", said the architect and TV presenter George Clarke. In his personal film for BBC1's This Week, he said housing was a political football and no government over the last 40 years had taken the decisions that were needed. Mr Clarke, who presents Restoration Man on Channel 4, said people were struggling to get on the housing ladder as there were "many expensive trendy homes, but not enough affordable ones", as he called for existing buildings to be recycled and re-used for homes.

      <body>It is rare to see women in Pakistan wear the burka or niqab, but British women do so because of the weather, joked Shazia Mirza. The comic reckoned women wore it as a political statement, or for fashion, and told Andrew Neil on BBC1's This Week: "A lot of these women choose to wear it, they are not forced to wear it." And speaking about female genital mutilation (FGM), she said: "It's not a religious issue, it's not a Muslim issue, it's a cultural issue". Panellist Michael Portillo said it would be "completely futile" to legislate how people dressed, while Alan Johnson said it was "astounding" there had been no prosecutions for FGM cases in the UK.

      <title>Me and Mrs Thatcher</title>
      <description>John Cole's final piece for the BBC - on his relationship with Lady T</description>

      <body>Margaret Thatcher was a disciplined politician. After all, she was the first woman to become leader of a British political party, which at the time, in the mid-1970s, was a revolutionary development. I am convinced that her gender and the fight a woman faced to get to the very top made her the kind of determined, obstinate politician she became. Her enamelled certitude often did not make her easy to interview. Yet after the Brighton bomb, when she had been through an experience which would have taxed anyone's nerves, she ignored the hustling of her bodyguards and waited till she was sure I had recorded everything I wanted from her. That was Margaret Thatcher at her courageous best. During the 1983 general election, the BBC had asked me to conduct weekly interviews for news bulletins of the three party leaders: Mrs Thatcher, Michael Foot of Labour and Roy Jenkins, representing the Liberal-SDP Alliance. It quickly became clear to me that these interviews were unlikely to produce anything I could present as "news", since the party leaders, quite understandably, recited the key passages from the previous evening's speeches. I was near despair when, one week, stuck in a traffic jam on the way to meet the prime minister, I read in a paper that an (un-named) Conservative MP had said: "Margaret's like a headmistress - she bosses us all about." At an arid moment in the interview, I sprang this opinion on her. The pale blue eyes beamed in on me: "Well, what's wrong with that? I had two headmistresses, women who knew what they believed and acted on what they knew, and the girls under their leadership all benefited from that." I had just enough sense not to interrupt but to let it all flow into the sound-recordist's box. Then I thanked her and ended the interview. For such a self-possessed woman, she became unduly anxious. "Was that all right?" she asked. "Oh, yes," I replied, for at last I had got something from her that revealed her self-image. Only when Gordon Reece, her press guru, arrived in the studio, rubbing his hands together in satisfaction, did she relax. The only other occasion when I tricked her into saying something unexpected was when she gave news interviews on the day she announced the 1987 general election. I knew that her deputy, Willie Whitelaw, and Lord Carrington had been telling her that, having been 10 years at the top of the Conservatives, she would be wise to retire at a time of her own choosing. So I inquired, kindly, whether this would be her last election. "Oh, no," she replied firmly, "I'm going on and on." It was news not only to my listeners and viewers but to any number of ambitious Tories who had their eyes on the succession. Most political leaders stay on too long. When Margaret Thatcher ran into disputes which forced the resignations of her foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, and her chancellor, Nigel Lawson, and opened up a party rift over Europe, her leadership was fatally damaged. She added to that an unpopular poll tax, which she clung to obstinately when her MPs knew it was putting their seats in peril. Each Monday, I used to stand in the Members' Lobby as they returned from their constituencies. I only needed to say "Well?" and they knew what I meant. A shake of the head, and a murmur that the poll tax was "disastrous in my patch". The braver added: "We're going to have to do something about her." Her supporters knew, as Margaret Thatcher had herself warned, that "the lady's not for turning". The poll tax would last as long as her premiership. So it was no surprise to me when, after Howe's damaging resignation speech, Michael Heseltine challenged her for the leadership. And when she failed to get enough votes in the first ballot to defeat him, I knew that the end of her reign was near. The next morning, I had not got my coat hung up before Conservative MPs were all but queuing up to tell me she was finished. It was when cabinet ministers began to say that she could not go on that I became confident enough of the trend to predict the end of what had been an exciting period in British politics. </body>

      <title>What price democracy? Counting the cost of UK elections</title>
      <description>BBC expert seeks to calculate the cost of UK elections</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24842147</url>

      <body>Polling day for many in the media is the lull before the storm: seemingly endless advance preparation awaits vindication from the main event which, for broadcasters, begins at 10pm. However, at each election a massive operation that completely dwarfs anything we plan to do has also been in preparation for many months and is launched 15 hours ahead of the election results programmes taking to to the air. The precise details of how elections are delivered are hard to pin down. According to Hansard, on 27 April 2011, Labour MP John Spellar asked in the Commons "the cost to the public purse of the 2010 general election". Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper replied: "We have estimated that the cost of the 2010 UK parliamentary election will be £113,255,271. This figure consists of £28,655,271 for the cost of distributing candidates' mailings and a further £84.6 million for the conduct of the poll." British Electoral Facts 1832-2012 records the following total costs for election administration and postal deliveries (cash totals unadjusted for inflation): All of the above excludes spending by individual candidates and national party organisations: in 2010 this amounted to an additional £45.5m - £31.5m on national campaigns and £14m of candidates' expenses. We know that the 2010 general election was contested by 4,150 candidates, representing 135 political parties; that UK electoral registers contained some 45.6 million entries (an increase of 1.3 million since the 2005 general election); that just over 82% of all votes were cast in polling stations and the remaining 12% by post. And that, as they say, is about it as far as the information goes. In December 2012, the Electoral Commission published their report "Cost of the May 2011 referendum on the UK Parliamentary voting system". The introduction states: "This is the first time that a full report has been published on the costs of running a national poll." Given the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum was a UK-wide event, it is the closest we are likely to come to the scale of organisation required in a general election. As with the 2010 general election, the 2011 AV referendum polling day was shared with a number of other elections: on this occasion those for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, as well as local elections across most of England and all of Northern Ireland. As a consequence, various costs incurred were shared with these other bodies polling on the same day. The total cost of administering the referendum was £58.2m. However, the report states: "We estimate that this referendum would have cost around £90m had it been held on a 'stand alone' basis." Nearly 45.7 million people were registered to vote in the 2011 referendum and almost 19.3 million (42.2%) did so. What was the scale of organisation involved? There were 42,781 polling stations used throughout the UK and hired at a cost of £4.3m. The average cost of hiring a polling station was £637 ranging between £486 on average in Wales through to an average of £1,323 in London. The polling stations were staffed by 119,500 people throughout the day at a cost of £15.6m. Some 45.7 million ballot papers were printed at a cost of £2.7m; and the equipment at the stations - ballot boxes, polling booths, etc. - cost £1.5m. Almost 7.2 million postal votes were printed and despatched for the referendum and 5.2 million were returned in their pre-paid envelopes. Some 45.7 million poll cards were printed and delivered to every elector. About 19.3 million votes cast in 42,781 polling stations across the UK were transported to 400 count venues where 80,500 people were employed to count them. The report comments: "The costs of referendum (or indeed party political) campaign broadcasts have not to our knowledge been estimated before." Undaunted, they asked "the commercial broadcasters" to estimate the total value of the Yes and No campaign broadcasts if they had had to pay for the space. The estimate they came up with was £420,000 for television broadcasts and £30,000 for those on radio. In addition to the total of £58.2m spent on administering the referendum, the Electoral Commission spent £7.5m on its public awareness campaigning, including the delivery of an information booklet to 27.8 million households. They paid a further £8.8m to the Royal Mail, including £1.5m for delivering 8.5 million items of campaign literature from Yes to fairer Votes and £6.7m for delivering 40 million items from the No to AV campaign. This summary of the detail of how the 2011 AV referendum was organised presents a picture that is likely to be very similar to what will be in place for May 2015. The estimated cost of a "stand alone" referendum was £90m - barely £5m more than the cost of the 2010 general election. Prior to polling day in 2015, around seven million postal votes will have been despatched and about six million returned and processed. Over 45 million ballot papers will have been printed to reflect 650 separate candidate lists for the election and the same number of poll cards delivered to electors. On polling day there will be around 43,000 polling stations staffed for 15 hours by 120,000 people. On election night, thousands of ballot boxes will be transported to centres where more than 80,000 people will sort and count their contents. Like most people, I take all this for granted, barely giving a second thought. Yet it is a massive, extraordinary and complex operation: the biggest manifestation of civic society that any of us are ever likely to see. </body>

      <description>Why John Cole will live on in all our memories</description>

      <body>The coat, the accent and, above all, the insight. All combined to make the inimitable John Cole. His was the voice which made sense of the drama and the upheaval of the Thatcher years; of the rise of Major and the fall of Foot and Kinnock; of three general election campaigns - in 1983, 1987 and 1992. Millions listened - not least amongst them today's generation of political leaders and, of course, today's political journalists too. Before Mrs Thatcher was ejected from office John told us what was about to unfold. When she'd tempted fate by promising to go "on and on and on" it was John who'd tempted her. When she'd narrowly escaped being assassinated - by an IRA bomb which tore apart Brighton's Grand Hotel - it was John she sought out to broadcast her defiance to the world. For any journalist this would have been a nerve tingling moment. For a proud boy from Belfast even more so. That pride in his Northern Irish roots stopped John from joining in the laughter when Private Eye and Spitting Image mocked his way of saying "hondootedly" or "Missus T-atcher". What few realised then was that he was something of a pioneer for broadcasters with accents. He was a pioneer too for those who saw their job as offering analysis not just bland reporting. Not bad for a man who was a broadcasting novice until his early 50s - a man who'd come to his on-air job after a distinguished newspaper career during which he'd been deputy editor of both the Guardian and the Observer. As a young TV producer on the BBC's Sunday lunchtime programme On the Record I worked with John on the elegant and witty sketch he wrote to summarise the week in politics. I vividly remember the vigorous debate he launched in the "green room" when, after Labour's 1992 election defeat, the party's young rising star argued it should speak up for consumer not producer interests. Cole challenged Tony Blair to explain why what he called "Which? magazine socialism" would succeed. The soon-to-be Labour leader must have been relieved that the BBC's political editor had decided to retire. Passion and professionalism. Warmth and wit. Knowledge and insight. All ensure John Cole will live long in our memories. </body>

      <description>Do MPs agree with Russell Brand and Jeremy Paxman?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24832816</url>

      <body>BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman has condemned the "green-bench pantomime in Westminster" and comedian Russell Brand has criticised "the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". BBC Radio 4's PM programme asked three MPs for their views on voter apathy. Like it or not, most people's lives are run by political decisions and those political decisions are made by politicians that you elect. The trouble is that not enough people bother to go out and elect us. There's a cynicism; we don't help ourselves. Interestingly, last night I was at a dinner and an MP got up and the first thing she said was: "Before I was an MP I had a proper job." She was a youth worker. We're actually quite self-deprecating and that plays into the hands of cynical people, of which I would count Jeremy Paxman, who have this caricature of politicians as a bunch of duplicitous so-and-sos on some big gravy train, living the life of Riley. Actually being an MP is a job, it's an exceptional job, and most of us spend an awful lot of time, blood, sweat and tears, putting a lot of effort into it. I don't mind people attacking my political policies, and they can say I've got it absolutely wrong over certain things I've been doing in my constituency, or in Westminster - but this constant attack that actually all MPs are duplicitous, and we're just on this gravy train and we're good for nothing, and it's all a pantomime is deeply undermining of the democratic process, and can only switch people off from bothering to vote, particularly young people. That's why barely 40% of young people at the last election who were able to vote for the first time - 18 to 24-year-olds - actually bothered to vote, and that really is worrying for the future. [Russell Brand is] deeply destructive, actually. Watching that interview with Jeremy Paxman he's very amusing, very articulate, but it's deeply destructive, the influence on young people who think, "Gosh, Russell said we shouldn't bother to vote, let's not vote". The way not to get [turnout] to improve is to say, it's all a waste of time and to go on the champagne anarchist ego trip that Russell Brand is on. That really doesn't help. I did some work at the beginning of the century, in 2001, when the turnout in my constituency was particularly low. What I found was that people weren't apathetic about voting, they were angry. It was anger not apathy that motivated them. The problem really is that we tend to set our agenda from the Westminster bubble, so what concerns us here in Westminster.... we really don't listen, and we really don't connect to people in the community enough. So I've completely changed the way I do my politics from that experience. Now the first thing I do is listen, and people's politics really starts from the local, they care about what's happening in their home, and in their local community. Quite often I can't address the national issues that worry them: I couldn't address the issues about immigration in Barking before the last election, or the lack of social housing. But I could address the issues about the post boxes, where they were sited, or whether the rubbish was collected, or whether we had prostitution on the street corner. When I started addressing those issues that really concerned them, I connected with local people, I started to build trust, and I then got people voting again and voting for me, and seeing off [2010 BNP general election candidate for Barking] Nick Griffin. Whilst Russell Brand may be right to be fed up, the answer is not revolution. There are no great divides in principle between the three parties. By and large we're all in favour of the mixed economy, we're all by and large - with some exceptions - in favour of state education, the kind of things which were battles between different parties have disappeared. In addition to that, politics has become a question of management: can you manage the economy better than I can? The third thing, rather paradoxically, is that the information technology revolution has meant that the age of deference has been swept aside, and I'm in no doubt whatsoever that there were people in the House of Commons 20, 30, 40 years ago who were a lot less than the perfect MP, but of course in those days no-one knew. On the whole question of executive pay: 50 years ago, my mother wouldn't have had the slightest idea what the director general of the BBC was paid, and she wouldn't have thought it was her business, but now because information is better available people are better informed and inevitably people are less charitable. [Russell Brand showed] a real lack of self-awareness: everything's wrong, but absolutely no suggestions as to how it would be put right. If Russell Brand were the prime minister, imagine what kind of country it would be - if you possibly can.

      <body>BT Sport has announced an exclusive £897m three-year deal to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League football matches. The broadcaster has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season from 2015 after talks with European governing body Uefa. A BT spokesman said it had "shaken up the UK TV market" and would make some matches, including finals, free to air. The news is a major blow to Sky and ITV, which currently share the rights. While BT said it was the first time a single UK broadcaster had won the exclusive live rights to all matches from the two tournaments, Sky said the deal was "far in excess" of its own valuation. "I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Champions League and Europa League," said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. ITV has been the free-to-air broadcaster of the Champions Leage since it launched in 1992. "We were not prepared to pay over the odds in the latest live rights round," read an ITV statement. "Viewers will be able to continue to watch both competitions free on ITV through to 2015 and we remain the home of live England football." The new contract, priced at £299m a season, is worth more than double the current arrangement, which could mean significantly more money for clubs in the two European competitions. Each of the 32 teams in the group phase of the Champions League currently receive a participation payment of around £7m and £396,000 for every match played in the group stages. The winners get more than £30m in total. As part of the deal, BT has said it will show at least one match involving each participating British team for free every season. "We are new to the market. The key for us is growing our broadband business. We are available on all platforms. If customers do not want to be BT broadband customers, they can pay for the service as well," Patterson told BBC News. John Petter, boss of the company's consumer division, added: "Today, to get the whole competition, you typically have to pay Sky £40 or so a month. The pricing is not being announced today, but I can say that this will be far more affordable than currently." However, Sky indicated its rival had paid much more than it was prepared to offer. "We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation," read a statement from Sky. "There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more. "Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering." BT launched its UK sports channels on 1 August 2013 in a challenge to the dominance of sports coverage on Sky. BT has already spent £738m over three years for the rights to show 38 live Premier League matches for the 2012-13 season, while Sky paid £2.3bn for 116 matches a season. Other events in the BT portfolio include the rights to Premiership Rugby and motorsports such as Moto GP and Nascar, as well as taking over ESPN's UK sports channels. Only last week, it said more than two million people had subscribed to its television sports channels since August and reported six month pre-tax profits of £948 million. For its part, Sky announced in October that record numbers had tuned into the start of the football season  - with an average audience of 1.55m compared with 1.29m last year. BBC News business correspondent Joe Lynam said: "Sky has achieved well over 10 million paying subscribers in the UK. The backbone of that success is well-presented live football coverage. "While Sky has seen off challenges from ITV Digital, ESPN and Setanta, BT is posing the most formidable challenge. "BT is already in almost every UK home with a telephone line and is also the largest broadband provider in the market. It isn't charging anything to show live Premier League football for existing broadband customers but will be charging for some Champion League games from 2015, although no pricing structure has been published. "Their aim of becoming the home of live football coverage in Britain takes a giant step forward with this announcement and might even have an impact on Sky shares when trading restarts on Monday." </body>

      <title>Bank's Help to Buy role questioned</title>
      <description>An influential committee of MPs asks the Bank of England to clarify its role in policing the Help to Buy scheme amid fears of a property bubble.</description>

      <body>An influential committee of MPs has asked the Bank of England to clarify its role in policing the Help to Buy scheme amid fears of a property bubble. The Treasury Select Committee said that the "scope and limits" of the Bank's role were not clear. In September, Chancellor George Osborne asked the Bank to take a bigger role in ensuring the Help to Buy scheme did not fuel a property boom. Help to Buy is aimed at helping first-time buyers get on the property ladder. The government said it would assist those who could afford the regular mortgage repayments, but who were unable to raise a large deposit required by many lenders. The first phase of the Help to Buy scheme in England started in April, when buyers of newly built homes were eligible for a 20% equity loan from the government on top of their 5% deposit. Similar schemes are operating in Scotland and Wales. Under the second phase, buyers across the UK only need to provide a small deposit, with the government offering a guarantee of 15% of the loan to the lender - for a fee - to encourage the bank or building society to offer the loan. A host of big mortgage lenders have started, or promised to offer, new products under the scheme, although the UK's biggest building society - the Nationwide - has not decided on whether it will sign up. Critics have suggested that these products would fuel an artificial housing bubble and expressed concerns about how it will be brought to an end, prompting the chancellor to ask the Bank to keep a close eye on it. The Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee is able to modify parts of the Help to Buy scheme to keep it in check. It can reduce the £600,000 cap on properties under the scheme, so that fewer homes are affected. It can also also make loans less attractive by recommending that the Treasury raises the fees paid by lenders for the guarantees. The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Andrew Tyrie, has now written to the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, asking him to outline the Bank's role and how it would keep itself detached from government policy on the scheme. "The scope and limits of the Bank's role in this scheme need a good deal of clarification, both to safeguard the Bank's authority to act in fulfilment of its statutory responsibility for financial stability and to safeguard its independence," he said. </body>

      <title>S&amp;P cuts France credit rating to AA</title>
      <description>Standard and Poor's cuts France's credit rating again to AA, almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status.</description>

      <body>Standard and Poor's (SandP) has cut France's credit rating to AA from AA+. The moves comes almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status. SandP said it downgraded France because high unemployment in the country was making it hard for the government to make important reforms which would boost growth, The French government responded by saying that its debt rating was one of the safest in the eurozone. SandP said it expected government debt to hit 86% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 and unemployment to remain above 10% until 2016. The country's Finance Minister, Pierre Moscovici, said SandP had made "critical and inexact judgements". He said in a statement: "During the last 18 months the government has implemented major reforms aimed at improving the French economic situation, restoring its public finances, and its competitiveness." In theory, a lower credit rating makes borrowing more expensive. The return for investors buying French debt indeed did rise after the announcement. The yield on French government 10-year bonds rose more than 20 basis points to 2.389% from 2.158%. SandP said in its statement: "We believe the French government's reforms to taxation, as well as to product, services and labour markets, will not substantially raise France's medium-term growth prospects and that ongoing high unemployment is weakening support for further significant fiscal and structural policy measures." Our business editor, Robert Peston, said SandP was "very publicly criticising France for not doing more to lift its economy out of the economic doldrums and cut persistently high unemployment". He said that, coming on the back of yesterday's decision by the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to almost zero, to ward off the threat of deflation and a return to recession, it was more evidence that the eurozone's structural weaknesses are far from being fixed. The French Prime Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said France's ratings remained among the best in the world and that the agency did not take into account all the reforms made by the government. However, the downgrade could be the last for some time. SandP attached a "stable outlook" to France, which implies a less than one-in-three chance that it would change France's rating over the next two years. </body>

      <title>Nissan's Ghosn warns UK over EU exit</title>
      <description>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn has told the BBC. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election in 2015. But Mr Ghosn also added that he considered the exit scenario to be unlikely. Nissan's new model will be built in Sunderland, where it employs 6,500. When asked how Nissan would react if the UK were to leave the EU, Mr Ghosn said: "If anything has to change, we [would] need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future." Praising the Sunderland plant, Mr Ghosn told the BBC it was one of the most productive in Europe and said Nissan was "blessed" to own it. With sales of more than 240,000 last year, the Qashqai, to be built in Sunderland, is Nissan's best-selling car in Europe. The car accounts for more than half the output of the Sunderland plant and Mr Ghosn says the new model "ensures" a lot of jobs in the city. This is not the first time that Mr Ghosn has linked Nissan's UK investment to the country's role within the EU. In October 2002, he told the BBC News website that the Sunderland plant's future would depend on whether the UK adopted the euro. However, the UK has continued to use the pound and Nissan is still making cars in Sunderland. Mr Ghosn, who is also chief executive of Nissan's sister company Renault, says that after five years of decline the European car market is arriving at "the end of the tunnel". He says that next year, the European market should be stable with possibly a little growth. Action by the European Central Bank, including Thursday's cut in interest rates, could help that recovery according to Mr Ghosn. </body>

      <body>Barclays is to close four branches and move staff and banking services to nearby Asda stores. It said it then wanted to open another four branches in Asda supermarkets by early next year in an attempt to make banking more convenient. The initial four branches will swap locations to make parking easier, and sees branches with relatively low footfall being moved to the stores. Asda said that access to banking services was vital for communities. Bank staff will work at the new supermarket-based branches during normal bank opening hours, with cash and cheque machines accessible during the supermarkets' opening hours. The first branch will be opened in an Asda store at Birchwood in Cheshire in February. Three more will later be opened at Asda stores in Pudsey in West Yorkshire, North Watford in Hertfordshire and Broadstairs in East Kent. The additional four stores for new branches will be chosen later. Bank branches in supermarkets are common the US. </body>

      <body>Young Lee, co-founder of frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry, was found guilty by a California judge of beating a homeless man in Los Angeles in June of 2011. According to documents, Mr Lee became angry after the man, Donald Bolding, flashed a graphic tattoo at the people in Mr Lee's car, including his fiancée. He later returned with an accomplice and beat Mr Bolding with a tyre iron. Mr Lee, 49, co-founded Pinkberry in 2005 but left the company in 2010. He was arrested in January 2013 at Los Angeles International Airport on "outstanding charges." Prosecutors said Mr Bolding was struck twice in the head and suffered a broken arm, before passerby stepped in to stop the attack. Mr Lee faces up to seven years in California state prison. A sentencing hearing is scheduled for 14 January. </body>

      <title>US job creation stronger in October</title>
      <description>The US economy added a better-than-expected 204,000 jobs in October, despite the 16-day shutdown of some government services last month.</description>

      <body>The US economy added a better-than-expected 204,000 jobs in October, according to the latest figures from the Labor Department. There had been fears that the 16-day shutdown of government services last month could have hit jobs growth. The monthly non-farm payroll figure is taken as a key indicator of the health of the world's biggest economy. However, the latest figures also showed that the unemployment rate edged up to 7.3% from 7.2% in September. The Labor Department said that this was likely to be because many federal workers were counted as unemployed during the shutdown. The report also said that employers added 60,000 more jobs in September and August than earlier estimates had suggested. The latest figures add to a positive week for US economic data. On Thursday, it was announced that the US economy grew at a better-than-expected annual pace of 2.8% in the third quarter. Investors are watching closely the health of the US economy, with signs of growing strength likely to raise expectations that the US Federal Reserve will begin to scale back its massive economic stimulus programme. Chris Williamson, chief economist at the researchers Markit, said that the jobs figure had "defied" expectations of a slump in jobs creation due to the shutdown. "Analysts were expecting a mere 125,000 rise," he said. "The data will add to the view that the Federal Reserve is gearing towards a tapering of its asset purchases, but policymakers will most likely wait for clearer signs that the economy is capable of growing at a faster rate than seen in recent months, hoping to see a pace of economic growth that will eat into unemployment." In Thursday's GDP figure, the Commerce Department said that growth had been lifted by rising exports and a pick-up in construction of homes. However, it also said that the pace of growth in consumer spending - which accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity - had slowed from the previous quarter. Mr Williamson said: "The jobs report follows yesterday's GDP numbers, and together the data suggest that the US economy continues to expand at a reasonable pace, but that the underlying rate of expansion has cooled since earlier in the year, when policymakers began talking in earnest about scaling back monetary stimulus." </body>

      <title>Major Bitcoin theft from website</title>

      <body>A man who ran an online "wallet service" for storing Bitcoins has claimed hackers stole virtual currency from his site worth more than one million Australian dollars. The Australian man said 4,100 Bitcoins (US$1.04m, £650,000) were taken in two separate attacks. He said he would not report the theft to police as Bitcoin transactions are virtually impossible to trace. This has led some users to speculate whether it was an "inside job". In a radio interview with ABC News the man, who only used his online name TradeFortress, denied being involved. The Bitcoin virtual currency is increasingly used to pay for things online. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the theft occurred on 26 October but users were only alerted this week via a message he posted on the wallet service's website. "I know this doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry, and saying that I'm very sad that this has happened is an understatement. "Please don't store Bitcoins on an internet-connected device, regardless if it is your own or a service's." Bitcoin is the most well known of a handful of virtual currencies. The currencies are developed through a computer process called "mining" and can be traded on exchanges or privately between users. </body>

      <body>Police have launched an investigation into a gang selling fake gold investments after they were exposed by the BBC. Victims handed over tens of thousands of pounds after being contacted at home and promised large profits. One person targeted was Radio 4 You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl, who taped the calls and secretly recorded a meeting. City of London Police say they have now launched a criminal inquiry. The cold calls came from a company called Demmore Ltd, not to be confused with companies of a similar name, which claims to be based in Hatton Garden in London. It offered big profits through leasing gold to corporate clients. Investigative journalist Vahl has been reporting on fraud for a decade, so when the call came, she recognised it immediately. She secretly recorded her conversations and arranged to meet a company salesman. "It is really a thriving market. It outperforms most bank-based investments and underperforming stocks and shares," he told our reporter. "I can guarantee you 15% returns in 60 days." The company is believed to have made similar boasts to hundreds of people. Some, like David from Greater Manchester, were convinced. He has handed over £41,000 to the gang, who are still calling him and asking for more money. "Because I'd like to leave something for my grandchildren, I was very tempted. It all looked OK," he said. The company does look real and established. But the investigation by the You and Yours showed that it and the scheme it is offering are completely fake. They cite Boots and Wholefoods as business clients, but both companies say they have nothing to do with Demmore. Demmore Ltd claims to operate from the trading floor in the Thomson Reuters building at Canary Wharf, but Thomson Reuters says it does not and that no trading takes place within the building. The programme also revealed how the fraudsters buy up existing companies that have been operating for at least three years to appear legitimate. "I've been had. How am I going to repair the damage?" asked one victim. Criminal gangs have been selling fake shares for years, in what are known as boiler room scams. About £3bn was lost to fraudsters last year. But the fraud gangs have moved into commodities such as wine, land and carbon credits - and now this one is selling gold. "The indications are that it does appear to be a boiler room," said the director of fraud prevention at Barclays, Jim Winters. "The industry figures show that more and more people are falling victim to investment fraud." Fifty-three-year-old Michael handed over almost £90,000. "You just think it's too good to miss, there can't be a problem and you just kid yourself a bit. "I've just been in the process of sending them money - I haven't had anything back at all. I just don't understand how people can do this - they're predators." When the gang were confronted by the BBC, they continued to lie about who and where they were. The City of London Police are now investigating and a string of bank accounts found by the BBC have been frozen. It is not yet clear whether investors will get any money back. </body>

      <title>UK trade gap widens in September</title>
      <description>The UK's goods trade deficit was at its widest for almost a year in September, figures from the Office for National Statistics show.</description>

      <body>The gap between imports and exports of goods was at its widest for almost a year in September, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said the goods trade deficit widened to £9.816bn, compared with £9.557bn in August. Including services, in which the UK traditionally has a surplus, the overall trade deficit also widened slightly to £3.268bn. Separate ONS data brought disappointing news from the construction sector. The ONS said the UK's construction sector grew by 1.7% in the third quarter of 2013, but this was slower than the initial estimate of 2.5%. The trade data showed that export volumes in the three months to the end of September fell by 4.6%, while imports rose by 1.3%. The latest figures suggest trade held back economic growth in the third quarter of this year, when the economy grew by 0.8%, according to the first estimate from the ONS. Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said: "September's UK trade figures show that an imbalance between domestic and overseas demand continues to characterise the UK economy... The trade picture over a longer time-frame remains disappointing." David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce, said: "The UK is not doing enough to plug the export gap and rebalance our economy towards net exports." The ONS said the downward revision to the construction data would have "no effect" on the preliminary estimate of third quarter growth. The construction sector accounts for about 6.3% of the UK's economy. The ONS figures showed that activity in homebuilding had increased by 13.6% during the 12 months to September, while construction overall had increased by 5.8%. Jeremy Cook, chief economist at World First, said: "We can expect that the ongoing demand for housing will continue to increase construction output... and I would hope that civil engineering prospects, as well as those of a commercial nature, can mirror the gains seen in homebuilding." </body>

      <body>International Airways Group (IAG), owner of British Airways, has reported a jump in profits, helped by a recovery at its Spanish airline Iberia. IAG's shares closed up 8% after it reported pre-tax profits for the July-to-September quarter of 609m euros (£507m), up from 237m euros a year ago. Profits at Iberia were 74m euros in the quarter, compared with 1m euros in the same period in 2012. IAG has been trying to overhaul Iberia, cutting jobs and pay at the carrier. IAG's chief executive Willie Walsh said Iberia's performance had improved, but added: "The airline must continue to implement its restructuring plan and reach agreement on productivity changes to bring about long-term sustainable profits and growth." Quarterly profits at British Airways rose to 477m euros, compared with 268m euros a year earlier. IAG said BA had benefited from a strong London market and demand for transatlantic flights. BA was also helped by a 100m-euro "bounce-back" from last year's Olympics, when demand for business travel from London fell. For the first nine months of 2013, IAG reported a pre-tax profit of 103m euros, compared with a 121m-euro loss at the same point last year. </body>

      <title>Help offered to job loss BAE workers</title>
      <description>More than 800 workers facing redundancy from BAE's shipyards in Glasgow will be offered help to find other high-skilled jobs, Scottish ministers say.</description>

      <body>More than 800 workers facing redundancy from BAE's shipyards in Glasgow will be offered help to find other high-skilled jobs, the Scottish government has said. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it would be next week before the firm clarified which jobs would go. She said that once this happened the government would target help to affected staff at Govan and Scotstoun. Ms Sturgeon was speaking after she and Finance Secretary John Swinney met BAE management and unions at Scotstoun. She described the talks on Friday morning as constructive and said the Scottish government was ready to help. "The principal focus of the discussion this morning was on what support the Scottish government can bring to bear to those affected by redundancy in the weeks and months to come," she said. "We have well-established arrangements to help people affected by redundancy find alternative employment, to help them access retraining and reskilling, so we wanted to give a very strong message that that support is there. "On the upside, this is a highly skilled workforce and we know there are other companies out there who have a demand for these kind of skills. So it's going to be very important for the government to do what it can, in addition to what the company will already do, to match up those skills with the demand that there might be for them." Ms Sturgeon said there were engineering firms around Scotland that have a demand for the kind of skills the Glasgow shipyard workers have. She added: "There are discussions in the early part of next week between the company and the unions where I think we will start to hear some of the detail of the breakdown of the job loss number. "Obviously that detail is important to those affected but it also allows the government to know where the support that we can offer can best be targeted." BAE Systems confirmed on Wednesday that it planned to cut 1,775 jobs at its UK yards. The firm said 940 staff posts and 170 agency workers will go at its Portsmouth site, where shipbuilding will end. Some 835 jobs will be lost across its yards in Govan and Scotstoun, Rosyth in Fife, and at the firm's Filton office, near Bristol. To offset the job losses, BAE and the Ministry of Defence announced that three new ocean-going offshore patrol vessels for the Royal Navy would be built at Govan and Scotstoun. This was aimed at sustaining shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 global combat ships, sometime after 2014. </body>

      <title>Npower boss rejects bonus 'gimmicks'</title>
      <description>Amid controversy over rising energy prices, Npower chief executive Paul Massara dismisses forfeiting his bonus as a "gimmick".</description>

      <body>The chief executive of Npower, Paul Massara, has dismissed giving up a bonus in response to anger over rising energy prices as a "gimmick". In an interview with the BBC's Hardtalk, Mr Massara also warned of future power cuts unless there is a "stable environment" for investment. He said he earned around £600,000 a year, which includes a £150,000 bonus. On Monday Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw pledged to decline a bonus this year to help restore trust in energy companies. When asked whether he would match Mr Laidlaw's pledge, Mr Massara said: "I think the issue is, are we doing absolutely everything we can to keep costs down and to make sure it's affordable? "Gimmicks of saying 'I'm going to reduce my bonus' - If Sam was earning five million a year and he's willing to give a million, good for him. "My bonus is linked to my performance, is linked to getting it right for customers, is linked to employee satisfaction. All of my team are linked to that. If we don't deliver on that, we don't get a bonus." He said he thought the lights would stay on this year, but warned: "The amount of spare capacity to meet the peak requirement... has dropped from somewhere around 15% to five. "That is extremely low by historical levels... and unless the UK can create a politically stable environment to attract new capital, that new capital will not come in." On Monday Mr Laidlaw said the energy sector needed to urgently rebuild consumers' trust and to help do that he would not take a bonus this year. "Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it," he said. Recent increases of around 9% have caused anger and last month the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee summoned energy bosses to explain the steep rise in prices. In September Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to to freeze energy bills for 20 months if he is successful in the 2015 election. Energy companies complain that government policy is to blame for higher energy prices in particular "green" fees which are added to bills. Currently 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. Mr Massara told Hardtalk: "The more the government creates uncertainty with things like price freezes or other changes, it means there's less certainty and less likely for capital investment."

      <title>Thames Water bill rise bid blocked</title>
      <description>Ofwat, the water regulator, has confirmed that it has turned down Thames Water's request to increase customer bills by up to 8% next year.</description>

      <body>Ofwat, the water regulator, has confirmed that it has turned down Thames Water's request to increase customer bills by up to 8% next year. Thames had asked to add an extra £29, or 8%, to the annual average household bill for 2014-15. But the regulator has ruled that it must stick to a 1.4%-above-inflation maximum rise, set in the latest price review. The company said it was reviewing the decision carefully. It has the option to appeal against the decision to the Competition Commission. Thames said it had faced extra costs of £291m, because various items had cost more than the amount estimated when the price regime was set. These included bad debts, the transfer of private sewers, land purchases and higher Environment Agency charges that could not be fully estimated at the time. Ofwat and Thames disagree about how much these items will cost the company. The regulator said in October that it was minded to turned down the requested extra price rise. It has now confirmed that decision. "We said we would challenge Thames' application, in the interests of customers. We did just that and on the evidence provided, we are not convinced that an extra bill increase is justified," said Ofwat's chief regulation officer, Sonia Brown. The current annual average household bill from Thames Water is £354. Responding to Ofwat's decision, the company said: "We will review the decision carefully before deciding on our next steps." Thames is the UK's largest water company, with 14 million customers. A week ago, Ofwat's chairman, Jonson Cox, wrote to the water companies asking them whether they needed to increase their bills for the full agreed amount next year, given the squeeze on household finances. In December, all water companies will submit their plans for the next price review, which will eventually determine how much they can charge from 2015 to 2020. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has written to companies calling on them to recognise people's financial strain and "look closely" at whether price rises were justified. Labour leader Ed Miliband has called for extra help for people struggling to pay their water bills. New social tariffs for the low-paid, which were introduced on a voluntary basis last year, should be made compulsory, he said. </body>

      <title>Bookshops lash out at Amazon offer</title>
      <description>An initiative by Amazon to sell Kindle readers in independent bookshops is met with hostility among shop owners.</description>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>Tesco to use face-scan ad targeting</title>
      <description>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target adverts at different types of customers.</description>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all 450 of its forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, of Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <title>Plan to save salary-linked pensions</title>
      <description>Salary-linked workplace pensions will disappear unless action is taken to make the schemes cheaper for employers, a minister warns.</description>

      <body>Salary-linked workplace pensions will disappear unless action is taken to make the schemes cheaper for employers, a minister has warned. Pensions Minister Steve Webb has unveiled plans to remove legal obligations surrounding traditional final-salary schemes. He also wants employers to be able to improve lower grade pension arrangements, now used by most firms. Only 1.7 million private sector workers now contribute to final-salary schemes. In 1995, five million private sector employees were contributing to these schemes, which promise to pay a proportion of salary on retirement. Under the proposed new law, employers would no longer be required to give pensioners annual inflation increases. In addition, they would not be expected to provide pensions for spouses after the former staff member has died. Pension rights already earned would be secure, under the plans. The government hopes that by giving bosses the flexibility to cut back future benefits, some of the remaining salary-linked schemes will survive and remain open to new employees. The legislation could be in place before the next election in 2015, according to Mr Webb. The ideas have been welcomed by some providers. Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), said: "The ABI welcomes this consultation which provides a clear basis on which to debate a range of alternative ways to improve certainty for pension savers." Millions of workers are being enrolled automatically in new workplace pension arrangements, but for the most part these are not linked to pay. In many cases the contribution levels are so low that the eventual pension income is likely to be relatively meagre. The forthcoming legislation will encourage companies to provide income guarantees in these schemes, in the hope that people will regard pensions as less of a gamble and contribute more. The government is also planning to change the law to allow "Dutch-style" pensions. Employers would be able to band together to offer large-scale schemes which target a particular level of pension income. Ministers have been persuaded that these "Collective Defined Contribution" schemes would be cheaper to run and could provide savers with more certainty about their retirement. The government refers to the proposals as a whole as Defined Ambition pensions. The proposed new types of pension are: Analysts have said the plans will not solve the pension difficulties faced by UK workers. "There is no private pension structure that will entirely meet the needs of everyone without some risks attached," said Danny Wilding, partner at consultants Barnett Waddingham. "However the options described in the consultation would help to alleviate some of the major issues that are present in the current pension landscape." </body>

      <title>NIE told price rise must be smaller</title>
      <description>Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) is told it can only raise the average bill by £5 per year until 2017, not the £25 per year it had wanted.</description>

      <body>The Competition Commission has told Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) it cannot raise its prices by as much as it wanted to over the next five years. NIE controls the power grid in Northern Ireland and its charges account for about 20% of a typical household electricity bill. It wanted to raise bills by about £25 a year up to 2017. However, the commission has ruled that the increase should only be around £5 a year. That will now be put out to consultation. NIE said it needed the money for investment in the grid but the commission said its ruling "strikes the right balance" between the company and consumers. In April, the Competition Commission was called to settle a dispute between NIE and the utility regulator. NIE wants to increase substantially the amount of money spent upgrading its infrastructure. However, the regulator said the plans would add too much to bills and then referred the matter to the commission. NIE had been strongly critical of the regulator on the issue. Martin Cave of the commission said they had been able to increase the amount of money that could be put into investment in the grid compared to what the utility regulator had proposed, but also came up with a much smaller rise in bills compared to that proposed by NIE. In a statement, NIE said: "We welcome the publication of the provisional determination and will submit our response by the due date, 29 November 2013. "The Competition Commission will be holding further hearings to discuss responses to the provisional determination during December and we expect the final determination to be published in February 2014." The utility regulator said it welcomed the publication of the Competition Commission's determination. "The detailed determination will be made available shortly and we will consider the findings carefully and engage further with the Competition Commission during the consultation period," a spokesperson said. </body>

      <title>PM backs IDS over universal credit</title>
      <description>David Cameron backs Iain Duncan Smith's handling of universal credit - after claims the work secretary tried to "lean on" MPs investigating welfare changes.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has backed Iain Duncan Smith's handling of universal credit after a report by MPs claimed the welfare shake-up had gone badly wrong. The public accounts committee said much of the £425m spent so far may have to be written-off due to poor management. Mr Duncan Smith denies claims he tried to "lean on" members of the committee to place the blame on his top official. Downing Street said the work and pensions secretary was "doing exactly the right thing" with the new scheme. In a damning report, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said management supervision of universal credit had been "alarmingly weak". The committee said the project - to merge six separate means-tested working age benefits into a single payment - had been beset by a string of problems and still faced considerable challenges if it was to achieve its long-term objectives. initial estimates suggest at least £140m, spent on IT systems which cannot be used, will have to be written off but the full losses could be much higher, and may take up much of the £425m spent on the project to April 2013, the report says. Labour sources on the committee have told BBC News there was a "concerted" effort by Conservative members to shift the blame from Mr Duncan Smith on to his permanent secretary Robert Devereux. One source said there had been a number of extra meetings and discussions over amendments "pointing the finger" at Mr Devereux but the committee eventually rejected the criticisms of the official in the final text of the report. These claims were categorically denied by Mr Duncan Smith's spokeswoman, who said: "Iain has not asked for anyone to be named in the report. He has publicly supported the Department for Work and Pensions permanent secretary throughout this whole process." The committee's Labour chairman Margaret Hodge said she had not been approached by Mr Duncan Smith, but sidestepped questions about whether she was aware of pressure being put on Conservative colleagues. Conservative MP Steve Barclay, a member of the committee, said he could "absolutely rebuff" the suggestion that Mr Duncan Smith had tried to influence the committee, which is meant to be non-partisan and impartial. David Cameron's official spokesman was asked several times to confirm that the prime minister was "confident" that universal credit would be delivered on time and on budget, but did not do so. Instead, he told reporters: "The department is working to the 2017 timetable. That is the timetable that the department continues to work to. That is the target the department is shooting for and we are going to continue to work towards it in the way we are." The spokesman was asked whether it would be proper for a secretary of state to approach members of a select committee ahead of the publication of a report in the way alleged of Mr Duncan Smith. He replied: "There are procedures that are in place for the relationship between departments and select committees and that is something the Department for Work and Pensions have been very clear about." Asked if the prime minister was "completely happy" with Mr Duncan Smith's handling of the implementation of universal credit, Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "He thinks that the secretary of state and the department are doing exactly the right thing in rolling this out in a progressive way and in a way that allows us to learn lessons as we go. "That is what is being done and he very much supports that." Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who has oversight of Universal Credit as part of his civil service reform role, said it was a "very hard-hitting" and "useful" report which highlighted wider problems in Whitehall: "We are not that good at financial control... but also project management has been deficient for a long time." Labour's shadow leader of the Commons, Angela Eagle, demanded an urgent statement from Mr Duncan Smith on the allegations that he tried to "lean on" members of the committee. Ms Eagle described the PAC report as "devastating" and told the Commons: "It seems that the blame game for this costly fiasco has already started. "This morning we learn of a wholly improper attempt to lean on members of an independent select committee of this House by Mr Duncan Smith and his parliamentary team to try to put the blame on the permanent secretary." Commons Leader Andrew Lansley said he had spoken to Mr Duncan Smith and saw no need for him to come to the Commons to explain himself. In its report, the select committee said control over suppliers in the Universal Credit had largely been absent, with multi-million pound orders sometimes being signed off by secretarial staff. From the outset of the project in 2011, it said, senior civil servants had "failed to grasp the enormity" of the task they had been set by ministers, did not monitor progress adequately and had not intervened when issues arose. A lack of day-to-day control meant that top officials only became aware of difficulties through "ad hoc reviews" and as problems mounted, those in charge of the scheme had become "isolated and defensive". Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: "The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money. "Pressure to deliver a programme of this magnitude within such an ambitious timescale created a fortress culture where only good news was reported and problems were denied." Howard Shiplee, who took over the running of the project in May, has admitted mistakes were made but said real progress was now happening and much of the existing IT systems could be used. Responding to the committee's report, the Department for Work and Pensions said universal credit was a "vital" reform which would ultimately bring £38bn in benefits to society by helping people into work and reducing fraud. "This report doesn't take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery," it said. "We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls." It said it did not accept "the write-off figure quoted by the committee" and expected it to be substantially less. </body>

      <title>China data adds to recovery hopes</title>
      <description>China's exports and imports rise in October, the latest in a series of figures indicating a recovery in its economy.</description>

      <body>China's exports and imports rose in October, the latest in a series of figures indicating a recovery. Exports, a key driver of its growth, rose 5.6% from a year earlier, while imports jumped 7.6%. This follows data released this month which showed that manufacturing activity in China grew at its fastest pace in 18 months in October. The numbers come ahead of key meetings of China's Communist Party, with economic reforms set to be discussed. Known as the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the meeting will run from 9 to 12 November, and top leaders are expected to discuss reforming key areas such as the financial sector and state-owned enterprises. China's economy, the world's second biggest, has shown signs of a pick-up after seeing its growth rate slow in first half of the year. Its economy grew 7.8% in the July-to-September quarter from a year earlier, up from the 7.5% expansion recorded in the previous three months. Some analysts said the pick-up had been helped by a recovery in demand from key export markets such as the US. "Combined with the better export data in Korea and Taiwan, China's export numbers suggest some - although not yet decisive - improvement in global demand momentum," said Louis Kuijs, an economist with Royal Bank of Scotland. Over the past few months Beijing has also announced stimulus measures aimed at helping exporters and boosting domestic demand. These include tax breaks for small businesses, reduced fees for exporters and the opening up of railway construction. Analysts said that domestic consumption in China was likely to pick up in coming months and help boost its overall growth. "Domestic demand is still holding up, which can be seen from the import growth, and the recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figure also indicated that the domestic demand will continue to gain more steam in the coming quarters," said Sun Junwei, an economist with HSBC Global Research in Shanghai. Earlier this month, China also reported that its services sector, which accounts for almost 43% of its overall economy, grew at its fastest pace in a year in October, The positive data follows a rise in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment in September. </body>

      <title>ECB in surprise interest rate cut</title>
      <description>The European Central Bank cuts its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25%, down from 0.5%, in a surprise move.</description>

      <body>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25%, down from 0.5%. The move came as a surprise to many analysts. ECB president Mario Draghi said the decision to cut rates reflected an outlook of low inflation and economic weakness in the eurozone. Inflation in the eurozone fell to 0.7% in October - its lowest level since January 2010, stoking concerns of deflation in some countries. Prices in Greece - one of the eurozone members worst hit by the economic crisis - have not risen since July. Some economists are also worried about deflation in Spain. The ECB's target is to keep inflation just below 2% - seen as a healthy level for economic growth. Speaking at a press conference after the announcement of the rate cut, Mr Draghi said the bank expected to see "a prolonged period of low inflation followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates of below but close to 2%", and said the eurozone was seeing "weaker than expected economic activity". "Accordingly, our stance will remain accommodative as long as necessary," he said. He reiterated a pledge to keep rates low for the foreseeable future as part of the bank's new policy of offering forward guidance alongside its decisions. "Deflationary risks and the stronger euro seem to have motivated the ECB's move," said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING. "It is obvious that the ECB under president Draghi has become much more pro-active than under any of his predecessors." Rates had been held at 0.5% since May, and before that were cut to 0.75% in July 2012. The cut in the benchmark rate is designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that this will be passed on to businesses taking out loans, boosting the economy. The 17-member eurozone returned to growth in the second quarter of the year, recording a 0.3% increase GDP. But unemployment remains high and austerity measures in a number of countries continue to hold back growth. The euro fell sharply against the dollar in response to the decision, dropping more than 1%. A weaker euro may be a help to the eurozone economy by making European goods cheaper abroad, benefiting exporters. </body>

      <body>The US economy grew at an annual pace of 2.8% in the third quarter of the year, latest figures have shown. The growth rate was faster than expected, and was an improvement on the 2.5% pace seen in the previous quarter. Growth was lifted by rising exports, businesses restocking shelves and a pick-up in home construction. However, the pace of growth in consumer spending - which accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity - slowed from the previous quarter. Consumer spending grew at annual pace of 1.5%, down from 1.7% in the April-to-June period and the slowest rate since 2011. The release of the third-quarter GDP figures was delayed by a week because of the partial shutdown of the US government last month. Chris Thornberg, partner at Beacon Economics, said he thought 2.8% was a "good number". "You have got to remember at the start of the year there was a $2.8bn tax increase after the fiscal cliff," he said. That, he said, had taken a 1.8% "bite out of consumer income". Mr Thornberg added: "The only thing that worries me is that some of the growth is coming from inventory build-up, about 0.8%." The inventory build-up refers to products that have been produced but yet sold, such as cars, he said. </body>

      <title>The Wall Street boss glad she was sacked</title>

      <body>Sallie Krawcheck used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street - before two very public sackings at the height of the financial collapse. Now the head of women's networking organisation 85 Broads, she says she's grateful she was fired. From 2007-2011, Ms Krawcheck held prominent roles at banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Those positions made her, arguably, the highest ranking woman on Wall Street. But, at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, she had very public clashes with Vikram Pandit, the then chief executive of Citigroup, over her insistence that the bank should repay investors who had lost money using defective financial instruments that Citi had created. Eventually, she was forced out - a fate that would once again befall her, just a few years later, after taking on the role of chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America. Although those firings certainly stung, they gave Ms Krawcheck an epiphany - she felt that in times of distress, companies react by closing ranks, and diversity, particularly gender diversity, suffers. "What I saw a thousand times during the downturn was, 'We'd like to give her that opportunity, but we need to go with the sure thing - we can't afford diversity right now,'" she says. So now, as the boss of 85 Broads, Ms Krawcheck says her goal is to work in a more active way to correct the gender imbalance at the top. Ms Krawcheck bought 85 Broads for an undisclosed fee from its founder, Janet Hanson, in May. Created by a group of women who worked at Goldman Sachs' former headquarters at 85 Broad Street, it was initially created to mentor women in the bank. Now, it's exploded to a membership organisation with more than 30,000 paid subscribers from 130 countries. Ms Krawcheck is candid in acknowledging that her purchase surprised many people. "For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way," she wrote in a post announcing her purchase. "My standard response: 'Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I'm just focused on getting the job done.'" However, she says her first job - as a research analyst at Solomon Brothers in the 1980s - taught her to invest in what is supported by research. And she says research shows that "women are a phenomenal investment and that is true in almost any way you can define it". Ms Krawcheck cites data showing that companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity. However, despite those statistics, she thinks that gender diversity - particularly in the financial services industry - has stalled, mostly as a result of the fallout from the financial crisis. "During periods of stress, it's easier for all of us to be with people like ourselves," she says about Wall Street's behaviour during that time. "But eventually it becomes a shortcut." She thinks that as a result of this impulse to push out outsiders, bad decisions can often get made. "What I saw was a good deal of groupthink [during the financial collapse]," she says. "The same people, same types of backgrounds, looking at the same data coming to the same conclusion - which in this case was wrong." During that time, she adds, she was "talked at" a couple of times - but not necessarily listened to. She says that her goal at 85 Broads is to listen to the membership to figure out ways to convince Wall Street bosses and other large organisations that gender diversity is crucial to their success - that in times of stress, instead of closing ranks, companies should look for an outsider perspective. Furthermore, she wants to expand the mission of 85 Broads to invest in companies helmed by some of its members or by other powerful women. Ms Krawcheck is candid that while her two firings helped her crystallise what she wanted to do as an executive, it certainly wasn't easy to fall so swiftly, twice. "In my mind, I sat on my sofa in my sweatpants for nine months and waited for the phone to ring," says Ms Krawcheck, about the time after she was sacked by Citigroup. But she says she is grateful for both the highs - and the lows. "I've had a lot of ups and some downs and people have asked about how I've weathered them," she says. "I know for a lot of entrepreneurs there's a sense of optimism [in being boss of your own company]. I'd say the more overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude." </body>

      <title>Si Shen: Rebuilding PapayaMobile</title>
      <description>Games entrepreneur Si Shen of PapayaMobile explains why all start-ups need to have more than one platform for their products</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24749575</url>

      <body>Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families? One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of PapayaMobile, which produces games for mobile phones. Si Shen was born and grew up in China. Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot. Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise. When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist. But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas. Her mother's example influenced her heavily. Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. "He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.' And because of this dream, he changed the world." She remembers thinking: "That's so cool! I want to do something like that!" Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California. By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company. At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur. He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first. Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal. At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time. She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying "I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company." She got the job. After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008. They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market. After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise. At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular. Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone. The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point. "All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users." Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store. As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on. The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion. "Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.' That was a very serious situation," she remembers. "I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees. Everybody was looking at me every day. They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer." She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area. Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games. "Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone," she recalls. She was devastated. Her investors pulled out and she knew she had to do something fast. She quickly decided to take the risk of moving Papaya's games to a different mobile phone system, Google's Android platform. She took the chance because although Android was just getting established at the time, she knew "it was going to be big". Her bet paid off. Papaya's games proved popular on phones running the Android system. Later, after making some technical changes, the company's games were allowed back on sale through Apple's App Store. Ms Shen says she learnt a lot from the episode, gaining a better understanding of how the business world works and the dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket. "As a start-up, you cannot just rely on one platform, because one day if that platform tells you 'no', then you lose everything. You have to have back-up." She has also learned a lot about herself. Until then her whole business experience had been very smooth, and she had not known "the taste of failure". "That taught me that no matter what happens, if you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome." </body>

      <title>Australia's small farmers struggling with low prices</title>
      <description>Despite a bumper crop of spring produce, Australia's farmers are struggling against low prices, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24610074</url>
      <date>1383179185</date>

      <body>A near-perfect growing season for small farmers in two of Australia's biggest food belt regions - south-east Queensland and Victoria - has produced a bumper crop. But despite a bountiful yield, there is a nasty sting for numerous family-run farms as oversupply has driven down prices. It should be a time for celebration for growers, who have become hardened to a relentless cycle of droughts and floods in recent years. Instead many are complaining that they are being paid less at wholesale markets than the cost of harvesting their crops. At Peak Crossing, south-west of Brisbane, Wayne Allum saw part of his 10-acre (four-hectare) property disappear under murky brown floodwaters last year, but has now enjoyed textbook weather conditions following a mild Antipodean winter. Yet still he frets about his financial future. "It's a hard game sending your stuff to the markets and then not knowing what you're going to get for it. It is stressful and disheartening," says the former truck driver, who grows tomatoes, lettuces, cabbages, courgettes, and spring onions. "Prices were terrible compared to what it costs you to grow them, get them picked, grade them, box them and send them to the markets," he adds. "I won't send my stuff to the markets any more." Instead, he sells his produce from the back of a truck parked under the shade of a jacaranda tree on the main road to take advantage of passing trade. "It's not a huge living," says Mr Allum. "I'm better off just growing what I can, do everything myself and just sell it at the farm for a profit and make a living that way." The number of farmers in Australia is shrinking, and it's not just the current domestic oversupply that is hurting the bottom line. The amount of imported fresh produce has reached record levels, and Mark Vogler, owner of the Aratula Markets in Queensland, says growers are facing unfair competition from overseas imports, which he says are of lesser standard. Mr Vogler sells fruit and vegetables from local farms and wants prices to be set by the federal government to guarantee those on the land a decent return. If not, he believes the sector will continue to contract. "To see how fast the farms are going backwards has been alarming," he adds. "The Australian public doesn't know about it yet. The problem is once we do lose the ability to feed our people locally, we'll have to rely on produce that has come in from overseas unregulated." Ausveg, the industry body representing 9,000 of Australia's vegetable and potato growers, which generates about 4bn Australian dollars ($3.8bn; £2.4bn) per year, believes that financial security for its members lies far beyond the horizon. Australian carrots are an unlikely hit in Singapore and the Middle East, along with asparagus, humble fresh potatoes and leafy greens. Last year, just 7% of Australia's fresh fruit and vegetables were exported, but Hugh Gurney from Ausveg wants that to change. "There is a lot of product entering the market, and it makes it tough for growers to get a decent price for their product," he says. "As a result the Australian vegetable industry is looking more and more to overseas markets to supply fresh produce to Asia and hopefully relieve some of the oversupply in the domestic market." Yet Australia is so big that conditions for growers vary immensely, as do the triumphs and challenges, including October's bushfires in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, where some of the worst bushfires seen in New South Wales tore across vast swathes of forest and farmland. Perched off the southern coast is the "apple isle" of Tasmania, so nicknamed because it has long produced large crops of the fruit. The island of course grows many other crops, and artisan farming has blossomed on the island state in recent years, where small enterprises beaver away making high-value, niche specialities, including hand-ground spelt rye flour along with boutique jams and relishes. Crucially, the industry has established direct links to the public, according to Jan Davis, chief executive of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. "The thing that our small farmers do very, very well here in Tasmania is build on that relationship directly with consumers. So we've got a very strong farmers' market and farm gate sector down here," she says. Tasmanian farmers are also leading the way on exporting extensively. "We have product going right across the globe into Asia, Europe and the Americas. Just about anywhere you can think of there is Tasmanian product on a table somewhere," Jan Davis adds. But Tasmania's optimism gives way to a sense of gloom in other parts of Australia. In Queensland's sugar capital, Bundaberg, Mark Presser, a fourth generation cane farmer, enjoyed a record crop last year, and is on course to harvest another reasonable yield this time around. Yet he too feels besieged by falling prices and growing competition from overseas, most notably Brazil and India, where production costs are far less. He also complains about protectionism in Europe and the US. "Some days you wonder why you are doing it. We've got that much money tied up (in the business) we just can't walk away," says the 47-year old farmer, who owns 270 acres (110 hectares) of land. "The majority of the people who live in the big cities have got no idea at all how hard it is," he adds. He warns about the fate of other family-owned operators. "There aren't too many little ones left," he says. "They are just standing on the edge of the precipice and are on borrowed time." </body>

      <title>Rangers announce new chairman &amp; AGM</title>
      <description>Rangers appoint David Somers as independent acting chairman and confirm 19 December as the date for the club's AGM.</description>

      <body>Rangers have announced that David Somers has been appointed as independent non-executive director and acting chairman of the club's board. The club have also confirmed that their annual general meeting (AGM) will take place on Thursday 19 December. The chairmanship has been vacant since Walter Smith left the role in August. Rangers say Somers will "oversee the process of appointing a high calibre chief executive officer and further independent non-executive director(s)". Craig Mather left the role of chief executive last month with Bryan Smart also stepping down as non-executive director. Following the departures of Mather, Smart, Smith and non-executive director Ian Hart, finance director Brian Stockbridge and James Easdale were the only board members left. Rangers, who reported a £14m operating loss for the the 13 months to June, were due to hold their AGM last month but it was delayed after a group of shareholders seeking boardroom changes were granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session. That group want former chairman Malcolm Murray as well as Paul Murray, Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson appointed as directors - proposals that must be on the AGM agenda following the court decision. In a statement to the stock exchange, Rangers described 65-year-old Somers as "a qualified accountant" who has "spent all his career in fund management and in addition has considerable experience in matters of corporate governance". The club say they hope that Somers will "form a unified board and provide stability for Rangers". "In order to allow time for the process outlined above to be progressed, the company will hold its annual general meeting on Thursday 19 December," read the Rangers statement. "Mr Somers will, in accordance with Rangers' Articles of Association, be subject to re-appointment by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders at the AGM." The statement went on to outline Somers' current partnerships and directorships with Ace Europe Life Ltd, Europe Arab Bank plc, FRS Pension Trustee Company and TCF Investments Limited. </body>

      <title>Sports clubs to get £10m boost</title>
      <description>A £10m investment to develop club sport in Scotland is announced ahead of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.</description>

      <body>A £10m investment to develop club sport in Scotland has been announced ahead of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. Sportscotland, the national agency for sport, said the money would help local clubs meet increased demand and pay for 50 new development posts. The funding will be distributed over the next four years. Sports Minister Shona Robison said the money would develop the club sport network and help the Games leave a "lasting legacy". Sportscotland said it expected local sports clubs to experience increasing demand in the run-up to the Games, which open at Celtic Park on 23 July next year. About £4m will be given to clubs across Scotland as part of the Direct Club Investment programme aimed at boosting membership and improving facilities to help high-performance athletes develop. About 50 clubs will be helped in the first year, with 11 already securing investment for projects in hockey, swimming, gymnastics, athletics, rowing and basketball. East Lothian Swim Team secured £30,000 over three years to employ a part-time performance coach to work with talented swimmers, while the Clydesdale Amateur Rowing Club will receive £33,739 over four years to employ a part-time junior development coach to work in local schools and club sessions. Meanwhile, almost £6m will be invested in 50 new regional development posts for the governing bodies which manage different sports in Scotland. Stewart Harris, the agency's chief executive, said: "The connection between school sport, club sport and high performance sport is crucial in our drive to provide more and better opportunities for people to become involved in sport and physical activity. "Our high-performance system is already providing results on the world stage. Our Active Schools Network is making a significant impact on school sport and Community Sport Hubs are helping unite local clubs. "Today's investment is a further commitment to grow the club sport network across Scotland by providing every opportunity for talented club athletes to flourish, and paving the way for our future champions." Ms Robison added: "With the Commonwealth Games less than a year away, this new investment will play a pivotal role in developing the club sport network across Scotland and will leave a lasting legacy that can be enjoyed for years to come." Scottish Conservative sport spokeswoman Liz Smith MSP welcomed the funding. She said: "The primary responsibility of those who fill these new posts should be to develop sport in its most diverse definition and, above all, help grow Scottish sport at a grass roots level. "We need to work harder to ensure that the beneficiaries of spending on sport are not just for what are considered the most popular sports. "If Scotland is truly going to address the country's obesity and health record, we need to encourage more Scots to take up sporting activity." </body>

      <title>Demolition 'date set for Don Valley'</title>
      <description>Sheffield City Council announces Don Valley Stadium will be demolished later this month.</description>

      <body>Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium will be demolished later this month, a leading city councillor has said. Isobel Bowler, cabinet member for culture, sport and leisure, said it would be knocked down on 21 November. News of the demolition date came after a 5,922 signature petition campaigning against the stadium's closure was debated by Sheffield City Council. Don Valley closed at the end of September. It has been replaced by a refurbished track in Woodbourn Road. The petition, which called for the council to save "an iconic landmark of Sheffield", triggered a debate after receiving more than 5,000 signatures. Ms Bowler said: "The petitioners came to say that they had a vision and they could run the stadium at no cost to the council. "Whilst that seemed great they were never able to produce a plan to indicate how they would do this." She said campaigners had asked for the stadium, where Team GB Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill trains, to be mothballed for six months at a cost to the council of £180,000. "There was no evidence that they were going to be able to deliver what they hoped to deliver," she said. "At that stage what would have happened is we would have spent £180,000 and we would be back in the same position as we are now, moving to demolition. "So the decision of the council, after listening to the debate and respecting the petitioners' passion, was that we would continue with the policy that was decided in April. "The demolition date, which we will be writing to the group with, I've been told is 21 November." </body>

      <body>BBC News has heard from Deborah and David Raine - who have just moved into their home in County Durham, bought with a Help to Buy mortgage. The scheme means the government guarantees a proportion of the cost so that a smaller deposit is needed - the Raines said they would have been saving up for another five years otherwise. Andrew Bulmer from the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said, "There is more supply, but not nearly enough... There's a limit to how fast the industry can scale up to meet demand." </body>

      <body>The chief executive of Npower, Paul Massara, has dismissed giving up a bonus in response to anger over rising energy prices as a "gimmick". In an interview with Stephen Sackur on the BBC's Hardtalk, Mr Massara also warned of future power cuts unless there is a "stable environment" for investment. He said he earned around £600,000 a year, which includes a £150,000 bonus. On Monday Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw pledged to decline a bonus this year to help restore trust in energy companies.

      <title>World Cup 2013 is selling Rugby League</title>
      <description>Rugby League World Cup boosts the sport</description>

      <body>The UK is in the midst of a "golden decade" of hosting major events, from the 2010 Ryder Cup to the 2019 Cricket World Cup, via the 2012 Olympic Games, 2014 Commonwealth Games, 2017 Rugby Union World Cup and more. But one event some sports fans may not have caught up on is the 2013 Rugby League World Cup, currently being staged in England and Wales, with some other games in the Irish Republic and France. Rugby League bosses say that as well as staging a popular and successful sporting contest, this event is as much about spreading interest in the game outside of its north of England heartlands. "We are delighted with how things are going so far, we are more than pleased with it," says Brian Barwick, chairman of the Rugby Football League. "It has exceeded our expectations in terms of people going to games, the quality of the games, and media interest," He points to an attendance of more than 10,000 for the game at Leigh between Tonga and the Cook Islands, two small nations, and without any connections to the north-west of England. Other highlights for Mr Barwick have been the sellouts at Warrington, Rochdale and Workington, and a gate of more than 7,000 for the USA v the Cook Islands game in Bristol, a rugby union - rather than rugby league - heartland. Another surprise has been the powerful form of the US team. "We were very pleased with this, in what is not a traditional rugby league base," says Mr Barwick, who was attending a Sport Industry Group gathering in London. The former BBC and ITV television sport executive, says World Cup organisers are also happy with TV viewing figures to date, and with the fact that every game so far has been "televised somewhere". "This event had to do things for rugby league," he explains, saying that organisers' aims were more than just raising enough cash to bankroll the sport for the coming years. "We had to introduce rugby league to a new set of people in this country. Fortunately, we had a good run in the media in the run-up to the event. "One of the reasons I came on board was to broaden its media perspective, and holding five weeks of World Cup sport can only help." He says that after a "classy" opening ceremony, the decision to play two games - including the high-profile England v Australia match - on the same Cardiff pitch on the event's opening day, paid off. More than 45,000 people watched that opening-day double-header. And Mr Barwick says ticket sales are healthy, and that more than 70,000 have been sold for the final at Old Trafford, Manchester, on Saturday, 30 November. "I think it is the legacy of [London] 2012, people have got into the habit of going to events," the former Football Association chief executive says, adding that the volunteering legacy from the Olympic Games has also rubbed off on his event. While at the FA, he saw through the completion of the new Wembley Stadium - which will host a Rugby League World Cup semi-final double header - and was involved in the appointment of Steve McLaren as the England football manager. Having experienced the national sporting domination of football, he believes that rugby league offers an equally exciting sporting alternative to both the round ball game and rugby union, and one "with unique qualities". "Rugby league is a world class sport, played by world class athletes, but is has got a family feel to it.," says the 59-year-old, who was appointed to his RFL post in January this year. "You can have a grandfather attending with his grandchildren - it is inter-generational. "We want to bring more people in, we want wider recognition... but sometimes we are seen as poorer relations to the other [rugby] code." He says the Rugby League World Cup will make money, and says that one immediate legacy of the World Cup is that people are enjoying the event. But he says that a bigger challenge is to see if they can retain and increase the current level of interest. "Those attending [World Cup] matches might stay with us, they might not, but our aim is to bring more people in. "It will ebb and flow, but this is an opportunity for us to put our flag in the ground." </body>

      <title>Gift cards and voucher warning</title>
      <description>Consumers warned to be careful over Christmas</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24868288</url>
      <date>1383959010</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/71004000/jpg/_71004956_p1020660.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Vouchers, or gift cards, can be a great idea at Christmas. Give them to a teacher, a colleague, or a teenager perhaps, and you can show you have at least thought about them, without second-guessing their tastes. But last year thousands of consumers were left out of pocket, when HMV, Blockbuster, Comet and Jessops all went out of business after the Christmas period. Most vouchers were eventually honoured but only after a period of uncertainty. In the case of Jessops, now under new management, some people were offered replacement gifts, but customers with vouchers worth, in total, more than half a million pounds never saw their money back. The fact is, if you buy a gift card, there is no guarantee it will be honoured if the shop goes out of business. So can they be trusted? Not at the moment, argues Deborah Harvey, from Newport in south Wales. She and Louise McDaid run Safeguard All Savings, a website dedicated to protecting consumers' money. She believes passionately that gift cards and vouchers should be guaranteed if a retailer goes out of business. "If I give you £10, I expect to be able to spend £10; not to be told, 'Well actually, your voucher has expired, you can't use it. And by the way, we've just gone bust, so you definitely can't spend it,'" she says. She believes the best option would be for voucher money to be ring-fenced. In other words retailers would have to keep that money in a separate account for a specified period. Another issue is that voucher-holders are well down the list of creditors, should a retailer go out of business. They are currently on the fifth tier, alongside suppliers and the taxman. Only shareholders are less likely to get their money back. The body which represents the gift card business would like to see card holders moved up the priority list. For the moment, any administrator looking at the books of a retailer is obliged to pay the banks which have lent money to the business, the costs of the administration, and staff salaries, long before they look at gift card holders. "If a retailer goes in to administration, the decision to continue to accept gift cards and vouchers is down to the individual administrator," says Andrew Johnson, the director general of the UK Gift Card and Voucher Association. A recent study by a body representing insolvency specialists looked at other possible solutions. These included the idea of making retailers who offer gift cards buy a protection bond, a form of insurance which would pay out if a retailer went bust. They also considered the idea of extending the Consumer Credit Act. Currently anyone who buys vouchers worth more than £100 on a credit card is protected, half by the retailer, and half by the credit card company. The Act could, in theory, be extended to include smaller purchases. However, retailers could be severely affected by such liabilities. Many of them trade on notoriously thin margins as it is. Indeed some argue that shops might be even more likely to go bust, should they have to honour gift cards. "All of these options are quite difficult to administer, and they are also quite costly," says Andrew Tate of the Association of Business Recovery Professionals. "Taking cash flow out of a business in the current economic climate is difficult," he says. So what should consumers do if they are considering buying gift cards or vouchers this Christmas? First of all, they should watch their local high street carefully. Blockbuster, the video chain, has already announced its intention to call in the administrators, for the second time. "I'm really concerned that there's going to be something again this Christmas," says Deborah Harvey from Newport. "And it's going to be too late for anyone to do anything about it," she warns. The UK Gift Card and Voucher Association advises customers to think very carefully about where they buy vouchers from. It says as long as you trust the retailer, you should trust their vouchers. But the reverse must be equally true. If you wish to buy more than £100 of vouchers, make sure you buy them on a credit card. But otherwise there are still no guarantees that your money will be safe. </body>

      <title>Entrepreneur who likes starting over</title>
      <description>'I'm addicted to the excitement of building teams'</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24853536</url>
      <date>1383868994</date>

      <body>The reasons that drive people to start businesses are many and varied. Some entrepreneurs are driven by a need to be the boss. They dream of creating a huge enterprise - with them at the top. Others see starting a company as simply a means to meet a particular need, and may find the business aspects boring and onerous. There's another set of company founders who not only love the challenge of solving problems, but also love the actual process of creating start-ups. The Californian serial entrepreneur Judy Estrin probably falls into the latter group. "I guess I'm addicted to the excitement of building teams," she says. Ms Estrin has been involved in the founding of eight businesses so far. She also has extensive experience of being at the top of some huge enterprises, through serving on the boards of companies such as Walt Disney, FedEx and Sun Microsystems. Ms Estrin says that, while she greatly enjoys and values her work with big companies, what excites her most is working in a smaller environment. "The best innovation happens when you have teams that are no bigger than a jazz band," she says. She says she did try to break her addiction to start-ups for a while - but what drew her back in was when her son got involved in launching a company. That business is Evntlive, a firm that streams live and on-demand concerts and events over the internet. The company has featured artists such as Bon Jovi, Moby, Wale and events such as the Mountain Jam festival. Pay-per-view costs typically range from around $3 to $11 (£2-£7), and vary depending on whether the concert is live or recorded. The enterprise seems to have entered a crowded marketplace, competing with many other streaming services from companies such as Netflix, and cable and satellite TV. However Ms Estrin believes that Evntlive can gain an edge over competitors by offering lots of extra features, such as additional content and integration with social media, allowing fans to communicate easily with each other during events. "We have what we call a 'buzz' feature, which is commenting and so everybody who's watching the concert can be commenting," she says. Ms Estrin studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, and subsequently at Stanford University, where she worked with Vint Cerf, one of the pioneers of the internet. Despite having offers to work at several big firms, she joined a small new company called Zilog, because "a friend of my father's said that the smartest people he knew were at that company". Zilog was involved in making silicon chips. Ms Estrin says she found it both exciting and enlightening working at a technology start-up. Something she found particularly valuable was being included in the customer feedback loop, something that could happen only because the firm was still small. "In a big company, the engineers are very separated from the problems of the customer," she says. Bitten by the start-up bug, Ms Estrin left Zilog in order to launch companies of her own. Together with her then husband Bill Carrico, she founded Bridge Communications, which was an early pioneer of computer networking devices. She went on to launch a string of other businesses. One of these, Precept Software, was acquired by technology giant Cisco. Ms Estrin joined Cisco, and spent two years with the firm as chief technology officer. But not all of her ventures proved to be successful - one company eventually had to be closed down. Ms Estrin says it was an "awful" experience, not so much because of the notion of failing, but because "this group of people were going to not have jobs the next day". Nevertheless, she says that failure is "an inherent part of entrepreneurship". It's difficult to learn and improve if you don't take some risks. Something she points out in her book Closing the Innovation Gap, is that not enough attention to the different levels of success. "You can be a mid-level success and you can still be having a lot of fun solving a lot of good problems, making money for your investors. Not every company is a Google or a Facebook," she says. After taking some time out to work on her book, Ms Estrin found herself drawn back in to the start-up world by her son, David Carrico, when he and his co-founders were setting up Evntlive. Mr Carrico says he's heard "horror stories" about involving family members in businesses. But he felt he needed to do what was best for the company, "and I didn't know of a better entrepreneur in my network that I could enable to be a partner in this". Ms Estrin provided initial funding herself, and after acting as an adviser and mentor, she formally joined the team as chief executive. She says the worst thing about working with her son is: "He calls me Judy instead of Mom… everything else is great." </body>

      <title>The adverts that talk back</title>
      <description>The adverts that interact with consumers</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24384335</url>

      <body>It seems unlikely that Dr Frankenstein's monster-making antics would shock people today in quite the same way they did when his story was published in 1818. Not because we've seen it all before, mind you. Rather, in a tech-savvy world, people increasingly expect connectivity and interaction as a matter of course. So bringing the monster to life is the least you might expect. If it sat up and could instantly tell you whether your train was delayed - now that might be considered impressive. Almost 200 years after the book came out, many businesses face exactly the same dilemma as the doctor in Mary Shelley's literary masterpiece. What happens if you're stuck with an inanimate object, but want customers to be able to interact with it? Just how can firms achieve the digital equivalent of a lightning strike and a maniacal screech of "It's alive"? Recent users of the Expressen app, of one of Sweden's leading national daily newspapers, may well have been surprised when an advert encouraged them to talk to it. They would have surely been even more surprised when the advert engaged them in a full-on conversation. According to the advert's designers, Nuance Communications, this is the first commercial example of an interactive voice advertisement. Nuance is widely believed to be behind Apple's Siri voice recognition technology (it isn't allowed to admit it though), but does confess to making Samsung's S Voice equivalent. "An ad on a mobile device is a very inanimate thing - people don't take much notice," says John West, principle solutions architect at Nuance. "If you look at adverts right now, be they mobile, print or broadcast on the web or TV, the individual stares at it, listens and possibly absorbs some of it. "The experiments we've done so far show that if you interact with the ad through speech the recall is far stronger," he says. "If you enter into a dialogue with something you become more engaged and you offer much more information because there's no clicking through or filling out forms." This opens all sorts of avenues to businesses that are always talking about engaging with the customer, but generally seem to be making it more difficult than ever to actually talk to them. Of course everything rides on the voice recognition actually understanding you and not, to your immense frustration, asking you to repeat yourself. Since Nuance is contractually obliged to keep the details of the advert secret and this author speaks no Swedish, this is rather difficult to test. Another of these voice adverts is being launched in the US this month, but its details too are being kept closely under wraps. "It will involve showing you a movie based around the product," explains Mr West. "It will tell a story, and ask you to make decisions that will drive the story. He admits he was originally dubious whether the company could keep people engaged in what is basically a five-minute advert. "But actually it shows off the product much better than an advert ever could because you look at the elements of the product in the order you want." As things stand voice ads are limited to mobile platforms - but what if you want a physical object, like a bottle or box to perform a similar feat of animation? Companies have tried to pull this off recently using augmented reality (AR) apps such as Blippar. For example, Heinz made its logo "Blippar-enabled", meaning tomato ketchup fans could scan the logo on the bottle in order to view a simple recipe book. Pepsi drinkers who looked at their bottles through the app saw the label on their bottle come alive, whereupon a magician would do a magic trick. But bringing brands to life in this way has not got everyone convinced. "The flash-and-dazzle approach is not sustainable," maintains Ryan Matzner, from New York-based mobile development company Fueled. "Big brands like Heinz tend to ignore the fact that consumers are not so easily distracted these days," he says. "How many people are actually willing to sit and wait while an app downloads so that they can get a recipe off a Ketchup bottle?" Blippar, with over three million app downloads and a total of 18.5 million interactions, would answer "lots". Alan Parker, managing director at digital advertising consultancy Lowe Epic, cites the Ikea AR catalogue as an example of successfully implementing the technology. The Swedish flat-pack behemoth's 2014 catalogue will allow shoppers to see what its products would look like in their homes through mobile devices. "That's genuinely of use to the consumer and does fit in with their behavioural pattern - they really do want to see what that sofa would look like in their living room," says Mr Parker. However, just seeing things is only the start. IBM predicts that in five years we will have the ability to "touch" a product through our mobile devices. Its scientists are working on using special vibration patterns to simulate touch, such as the texture and weave of a fabric. But what if an inanimate object interacts with you and you don't know it? In June, Renew London equipped recycling bins in the UK's capital with technology to track people's smartphones as they passed by. Renew fitted the devices into 12 "pods", which featured LCD advertising screens, to collect footfall data by logging nearby phones. The City of London Corporation later demanded the technology be turned off, though Renew chief executive Kaveh Memari said the bins had only recorded "extremely limited, encrypted, aggregated and anonymised data". Nonetheless, on occasions like this, it feels a bit like time to pick up a pitchfork and flaming torch, hook up with a restless mob and send the monster back from whence it came. Sometimes, perhaps, it's better not to play digital god. </body>

      <title>Would you bring your parents to work?</title>
      <description>What happened when I brought my mum to work</description>

      <body>For two decades, millions of companies, predominantly in North America and Europe, have invited staff to bring their offspring to the office for a taste of grown-up working life, for one day a year. Feminist and writer Gloria Steinem and the Ms. Foundation for Women in the US began the promotion of the day in 1993, so daughters could accompany parents to work, improve their professional aspirations, and their self-esteem. It was expanded to include boys 10 years later. So what about parents curious about what their adult children are getting up to all day? Is there a value in putting faces to names, and in seeing firsthand what sons and daughters are talking about when the topic of work is discussed over family dinners? LinkedIn, the professional networking site, has designated 7 November the day the tables are turned, and launched the first "Bring In Your Parents Day". So what about life in the BBC's Business and Economics newsroom? I asked my mother, Patricia, to come in and see what I do, after years of her hearing me speak in "BBC jargon" about the world of news. She had a long career as an orthoptist, looking after eye problems, and is recently retired. Her initial response was a little lukewarm. In a text she asked, "How long do I have to stay?" So instead of subjecting her to a 10-hour news shift, she came in just after lunch. It was, touchingly, a cause of unexpected excitement amongst the online team. Though I feared that my well-meaning mother would be unable to stop herself tidying some of the messier desks in the office. She might also notice her empty cake tin that I keep forgetting to return months after I'd made muffins for colleagues. (She did.) When she arrived, Twitter's shares had just started trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a big story for the department, which we have been following closely. So I had to temporarily abandon my mother, before a colleague could take over from me. "Everyone looks very busy," Mum says. "Also because it's about business, it's not a world that I am familiar with. There's a lot of terms and words that we don't use in everyday life." She adds that seeing things from the inside helps to "make clear the pressure of deadlines in this kind of environment". She was also surprised to see correspondents and editors that she'd previously seen on TV, like Robert Peston, sitting inches away from the rest of us. Companies in 14 countries are taking part in Bring In Your Parents Day. From ZSL London Zoo to public relations firms and even some in the banking sector, parents are spending the day in the offices of their not-so-little darlings. Liam Fay-Fright from the advertising agency Mother, where his staff are taking part in the initiative, says his company sees it as an opportunity to remind their staff of a world outside a creative media "bubble". "I think having our parents around for the day will help to keep us all grounded." Is he worried that this will be a day where not a lot of work will be done? "The loss of productivity will be made up for in gaining an insight and a reality check for the people who work in advertising," he says. "Meeting people's parents is always interesting anyway, and people do find it hard to explain to their parents what it is they do." Darain Faraz, from LinkedIn's press team says the idea came after a colleague repeatedly failed to properly explain what she does to her mother. "About six months ago we were chatting and a colleague said her mother had asked her to write a paragraph about what it is they do. I do think there's a disconnect with the generations when it comes to the world of work. Especially in media and online companies." So what are my mother's conclusions on my job? "It does seem quite tense as there are a lot of breaking news stories," she says. As well as being surprised to see so many different things going on in the one room. "It is also really good to put faces to names, especially when it comes to the bosses. "I am glad I came." As Linkedin's Darain Faraz says: "It is maybe a bit like a grown-up parents evening." </body>

      <title>Should women improve networking skills?</title>
      <description>Should female executives take up golf and poker?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24801975</url>

      <body>There is a widely held belief that women are generally better than men at developing and maintaining relationships. But many women seem unable to transfer those skills to the business world, where the same activity is commonly called "networking". "Part of the cause is that women value authenticity in relationships," says Deborah Gillis, chief operating officer for Catalyst, a women's business research and advocacy group. "Sometimes the notion of meeting someone and then looking to them for help, or advice, or contacts in business, often feels just a little uncomfortable. Men seem to do it much more naturally." Experts have various explanations as to why this might be, but they are agreed on one important point - informal networks are critical to success, and more women need to learn how to benefit from them. "Women need to think about networking as a business skill," says Ms Gillis. "And just as we would focus our attention on developing other skills that are important to our success, we should spend time and care in building our confidence and ability to network effectively." But becoming a part of informal groups - especially those dominated by men - can be difficult, as technology blogger and consultant Vanessa Fox discovered when she left Google to start her own company in Seattle. As one of the industry's few female experts on search engine optimisation, she had to overcome both professional and social barriers - and that meant learning how to play poker. "I would go to these poker games, and I was always the only woman there," she says. "It's not that the men exclude women - they actually invited me - it's that women either don't know about [these activities], or they're intimidated. "I think they have this idea that men can automatically play poker. But actually men can't play poker either, and a lot of women I know are really good at math - more so than the guys." But the game itself isn't as important as the conversations that naturally develop, she says. "They tell you what their start-up does and what they're doing, and so you get to know people. And because of my experience, a lot of these guys then want to meet up with me because they want my advice - and that's when you start to build relationships outside of the more formal events." Ms Fox is the first to point out that such an approach isn't for everybody, but adds that she had little choice. "I've had to join men's networks because that's what was out there," she says. "The tech start-up world happens to be mostly men, and it happens that they want to play poker. "They're not actively saying they're going to try to find a thing that women don't like - they just want to have a good time." Sport has also become a popular networking tool for women. "If you can speak sport, talk sport, in an authoritative way where you actually watch it, and follow the game and you're passionate about it, it allows you to be one of the gang and gets you into the circle you can't get into any other way," says Susan Spencer, a former manager at American football team Philadelphia Eagles. She says sport offers a "safe" subject for women to talk about with their male counterparts. Ms Spencer adds: "If you go out for drinks you don't want to talk about politics, that's a deadly one, you're not going to do boy talk with a load of sexual innuendoes because that takes you down a road you don't want to go - it has to be sport!" Jenn Harris has taken the idea a stage further with the launch last year of High-heel Golfer. Based in San Diego, she travels all over the country offering workshops to women who want to use the game to develop better business relationships. "I don't think of the golf course as a man's world. I think of it as a place to learn about someone else," she says. "All the little things that happen are ways to see who that person really is - how do they react after a shot, do they cheat, do they have integrity? You can't get that over drinks at a happy hour." A keen golfer since the age of seven, Ms Harris cites her own experience as proof of the power of golf. While working for a defence contractor she needed to get to know military commanders and other executives who all enjoyed playing. She joined them on the golf course, and attributes her subsequent success to the contacts she made. "I was promoted within nine months, was put on every big project over the next two years, and later, when budget cuts were made, the clients made it known that I shouldn't be fired - all because of that relationship I developed on the golf course," says Ms Harris. But employment expert Jean Martin says that unless women actually enjoy playing golf, the game is unlikely to be much use as a networking tool. "The number one element of a successful informal relationship is that the individuals are true to themselves. So doing something that you're not interested in just to be with people ultimately creates an artificial founding of the relationship," she says. Ms Martin is executive director of human resources at CEB, a global business advisory company with headquarters in Washington DC. She says research has demonstrated that effective networking can increase business performance by 30%. As a result, companies themselves are looking at ways to increase networking opportunities for women that highlights their different interests. "Rather than everyone trying to be the same, all on the golf course together, our data suggests that companies which have a lot of people with a lot of different interests and perspectives are significantly advantaged," she says. However, other studies still often show that professional women need to improve their networking skills. A 2011 report by the Toulouse School of Economics in France concluded that a major factor behind female directors earning 17% less than their male counterparts was the fact they were less good at building a network. The study found that in general the male directors had much larger networks of past acquaintances, while female directors instead focused on a few strong relationships. As she tries to build her own business, Jenn Harris attends five to six networking events every week - but says it's important not to make new contacts if you don't have time to follow them up. Vanessa Fox says she tries to be selective. "It is work for sure, and in my case there are some events that I know I'll hate and I just don't go," she says. "I try to find things that are a little more of a balance that I can enjoy and find valuable." </body>

      <title>Phosphorus: Farming's dirty secret</title>
      <description>The looming fertility crisis you've never heard of</description>

      <body>Is it the biggest looming crisis that you have never heard of? Since 1945, the world's population has tripled to seven billion, and feeding that population has relied increasingly on artificial fertilisers. Phosphates, among the most important fertilisers, come from an ore that is in limited supply. It is mined, processed and spread on to our fields, whence it is ultimately washed away into the ocean. So what will happen if one day we run out of the stuff? "Crop yields will drop very, very spectacularly," chemist Andrea Sella, of University College, London, told Wednesday's Business Daily programme on the World Service. "We will be in very, very deep trouble. We have to remember that the world's population is growing steadily, and so demand for phosphorus is growing every year." As Dr Sella explains, phosphorus is essential for life. The element - which is so reactive that it spontaneously combusts in its pure form - is used by plant and animal cells to store energy. It also forms the backbone of DNA, and it is an essential ingredient of our bones and teeth. Farming without it is not a realistic option. While this may sound rather alarming, there are two important caveats. First, the supply of phosphates is forecast to last for many decades, if not centuries, to come. So humanity is at no immediate risk of running out of the means to feed itself, even at the current rate at which it is gobbling up phosphates. Second, one of the biggest problems with phosphates over the past 60 years is arguably that they have been far too cheap and abundant. There has been no incentive to use them sparingly. Only a small fraction is actually absorbed by plants, and much is washed off by rain. And this glut of fertilisers being washed into river systems, both phosphates and also nitrates, has created a nasty environmental problem - eutrophication. This is where the abundant nutrients feed algae in rivers and ponds, creating blooms that turn the water green. The algae then die, providing a feast for microbes, which in turn multiply and suck the oxygen out of the water, killing off all the fish and other animal and plant life. It is a common problem in the lower reaches of major rivers such as the Thames and Rhine in Europe, and the Yangtze in China. Similar algal blooms occur in our oceans, where large areas - notably the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico - have become "dead zones". Purely from an environmental perspective, the price of phosphates has clearly been too low. Yet this now appears to be changing. The price of phosphate ores has risen fivefold over the past decade as demand, particularly from the developing world, has grown steadily. Meanwhile, the cost of fertiliser production has also risen as the richest, cheapest phosphate seams have already been mined. "Commodities are priced on the cost of extracting the next tonne that you need," says Jeremy Grantham, of US fund managers Grantham Mayo van Otterloo. "It is a hopelessly bad system. "As long as we can mine a vital resource cheaply, we will price it cheaply, and run through the reserves until they become very expensive. And then we'll start to conserve." There are various options: And then there is the sewage option. Why not just capture the phosphorus from our own waste and recycle it? Sweden and Germany have been leading the way. There is also a cottage industry among the eco-friendly in Western countries of "compost toilets". Now the UK's Thames Water is getting in on the act, launching a new "reactor" that turns sewage sludge into nice clean fertiliser pellets. How much of future supply could ultimately be provided by recycling is open to debate - Thames Water says 20% using the current technology. But perhaps the more important point lies in the fact that Thames Water and Canadian partners Ostara, which developed the technology, expect to make a profit. This should come from selling the pellets as well as from saving the cost of cleaning and replacing pipes that have become blocked by a phosphorus-based sediment called struvite. Any benefits, as far as the environment or the long-term sustainable usage of a limited resource are concerned, are but a happy by-product. The important point is that it is the rising price of phosphates that has made it worthwhile to start recycling the stuff. So should we welcome the higher price? Well, it depends who you are. In general, the lower your income, the more of it you spend on food and therefore the more sensitive you are to the higher food bills that might come with more expensive fertilisers. In other words, rising phosphate prices hurt the poor most, which is hardly a recipe for social cohesion. And that goes for whole countries too. As Jeremy Grantham points out, many North African countries depend on food imports, and rising food prices contributed to the discontent behind the 2011 Arab Spring. One of those countries is Morocco, which by a freak of geography controls about three-quarters of the world's remaining good-quality phosphate reserves. "Morocco has the most impressive quasi-monopoly in the history of man," says Mr Grantham. "It makes oil look unimportant in comparison." That could make Morocco a very rich nation in the future, one that the rest of the world will be keen to court. And it gives the country a great responsibility in pricing its product in a way that eventually weans the world off it in a manageable way - much like Saudi Arabia and oil. Ironically, the higher prices that monopolists like to set may actually be what the planet needs. But Morocco's unique position could also make it a centre of intrigue. For example, much of its phosphates are actually located in the territory of Western Sahara. It is occupied by the Moroccan military, which currently has an uneasy ceasefire in place with the local Algerian-backed Saharawi resistance. This poses moral questions for the multinational companies that mine the stuff there, as well as some obvious strategic issues for the rest of the world about securing future food supplies. Mr Grantham points out that half of nearby Mali - admittedly the sparsely populated Saharan half - was recently briefly overrun by militants affiliated with al-Qaeda, and he warns that Morocco itself may one day become the scene of rising social tensions, terrorism or revolt. "I would almost guarantee to you that the major militaries of this world are well aware of this problem. "They would not allow Morocco to become a hopelessly failed state," he says reassuringly. "You don't want to look forward to the great fertiliser wars of 2042." You can listen to Business Daily on BBC World Service at 08:32 GMT and 15:06 GMT. </body>

      <title>Academies rapped over standards</title>
      <description>The Department for Education warns 17 academies over the standards of education they are providing.</description>

      <body>A minister has warned 17 academies over the standards of education they are providing. The formal warning letters, issued since the start of this term, call for the schools to improve or face intervention. Five of the warnings were for schools in one academy chain, AET, which was prevented from further expansion earlier this year. All the schools warned may be put under new management unless they improve. Academies are state-funded but privately run schools. And the 912 sponsored academies, as they are known, are schools that have previously been struggling and have been handed over to education trusts to run with a view to improving them in a short space of time They are different from the 2,532 converter academies which tend to be higher achieving schools who have chosen to convert to academy status. Pre-warning letters, as they are called, are part of the process by which action is taken on sponsored academies which are not improving as well as they should. The standards of education they are providing are considered to be unacceptably low. The letters, all from junior education minister Lord Nash and his predecessor Lord Hill, appeared on a government website alongside 17 other older pre-warning and warning letters requiring academies to improve. This other batch related to the academic years 2011-12 and 2012-13 and have already been published, the Department for Education said. A DfE spokesman said: "The majority of sponsored academies are thriving under great leadership. Their GCSE results are improving far faster than in other state-funded secondary schools. "This is despite sponsored academies taking over from schools that were consistently underperforming, which can take time to reverse. "But results in a minority of sponsored academies remain stubbornly low. We will not tolerate long-term underperformance in any school - including in an academy. "That is why this government issues pre-warning letters and warning notices. The evidence shows that academies respond well to these warnings, achieving on average much better GCSE results afterwards. "However, as with maintained schools, if these academies still do not make the progress we expect, we will take further action. This may result in a change to the sponsorship arrangements." The Academies Enterprise Trust said it was acting to ensure a rapid and sustained improvement in the schools. A spokesman said: "The AET academies listed by the department have a history of underperformance and have been with AET only for a short time. Many of these schools have a significantly higher proportion of special educational needs and Pupil Premium pupils than the national average. Many of our pupils start life in our schools with attainment levels well below the national average for their age. "Our response to these challenges is to set ambitious targets for the progress that we expect pupils to make. Our culture of high aspirations is reflected in significant improvements in test and examination results across the board in the 21 primary and 24 secondary academies open for the full 2012-13 academic year." The news comes after the Education Select Committee called for academy chains to face inspections from Ofsted. </body>

      <title>More top graduates train as teachers</title>
      <description>The proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees rose to an unprecedented level in 2011-12, official data suggests.</description>

      <body>The proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees rose to an unprecedented level in 2011-12, according to the latest official figures. Two-thirds of postgraduate trainees in 2011-12 had a first or a 2:1, data from the Department for Education suggests. This was a rise of three percentage points on 2010-11. Teaching unions welcomed the figures but said the overall picture on teacher recruitment was patchy, with evidence of shortages in some areas. However Charlie Taylor, chief executive of the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said the figures were extremely good news. "Children deserve excellent teachers and today's statistics show the profession is attracting more of the country's top-tier graduates," said Mr Taylor. Some 12% of postgraduate trainees, more than 3,000, had a first class degree, up two percentage points on the year before. And the proportion of those with a 2:1 was 55% or almost 15,000 - up one percentage point. There was a two percentage point fall in the proportion of those with a 2:2 - to 27.4% or 7,450 trainees - and a very slight drop in those with third class degrees, the government says. Overall, 32,900 trainee teachers completed their courses in 2011-12. Of these 27,144 were postgraduates. The figures also showed a rise in the number of newly qualified teachers getting jobs within six months of qualifying. Of those whose employment status was known, some 91% had secured a job by January 2012 - a rise of at least 5% on 2010-11. "Schools recognise this increase in quality and more trainee teachers are finding jobs quickly," said Mr Taylor. The figures combine data on the numbers of teachers trained by universities, from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, as well as figures for non-university trainees collected directly from training providers by the National College for Training and Leadership. These figures pre-date the government's School Direct programme which began the following year. School Direct is designed to boost the numbers of teachers trained directly by schools with support from universities. Some experts have raised concerns that the picture from more recent years may be of emerging shortages of teachers in some areas. Brian Lightman of the Association of School and College leaders described the increases in the number of trainees with good degrees as "very good news". "However, there are still issues with certain subjects and in certain areas of the country. "Many schools report that they are struggling to recruit high quality teachers in core subjects, especially maths, English and science. "With the recent changes to initial teacher training, the big picture about where the gaps are has been lost." "It must be a priority for the government to reinstate a national strategy for ensuring that there are sufficient numbers of high quality teaching graduates coming through in every subject." Chris Keates of the NASUWT teaching union said the increase in the proportion of trainee teachers with top degrees began "long before this government took office". "Today's figures simply confirm the continuation of this long-term trend and reflect continuing increases in the proportion of 2:1 and first degrees awarded by higher education institutions." Ms Keates added preliminary figures for the following year suggested a fall in the number of applicants for teacher training places of "almost 15%" in 2012. "Concerns expressed by teachers, school leaders and training providers that the teacher training system is heading towards crisis continue to be ignored by ministers. "The adverse implications of the DfE's policies on pay, conditions and professional status are undermining the attractiveness of teaching and placing the sufficient supply of high quality graduate teachers at serious risk." </body>

      <title>11-plus coaching culture 'must end'</title>
      <description>An educational charity says the culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must end so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools.</description>

      <body>The culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must be ended so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools, an educational charity says. The Sutton Trust says grammar school entrance tests should also be changed regularly so they are tutor-proof. It urges grammar schools to offer test preparation classes to all candidates, so there is a "more level playing field" between rich and poor pupils. The government gives extra money to schools with disadvantaged pupils. The report, Poor Grammar: Entry into Grammar Schools for Disadvantaged Pupils in England, says pupils from very low income families are outnumbered by four to one in grammar schools by children from fee-paying prep schools. It found only 2.7% of grammar school entrants were from families who qualified for free school meals, while 12.7% came from outside England's state sector - mainly independent schools. Overall in England about 20% of pupils are on free school meals. It is well known that many children from affluent homes are coached for entrance tests, with private tutors offering expensive coaching services particularly in areas where grammar schools are high achieving but few in number. The report also suggested that many parents were using the private preparatory school route to get their children through grammar school doors. Those on lower incomes are less likely to be able to afford to pay for tutoring or private education. Grammars that stand alone, rather than in a wholly selective authority such as Buckinghamshire or Kent, draw pupils from a wide geographical area. This is also true of London grammars which have wide catchment areas, with sometimes 10 or 11 candidates for every place. The competition for places is very intense and not just based on passing the 11-plus but getting the highest marks. The report called for these high achieving schools to increase outreach work "significantly". This could mean such schools encouraging low and middle income households to apply and doing more to dispel the the view that some parents may have of them as "elitist", it said. It even suggests giving priority to poor, bright pupils who meet certain entrance requirements and are eligible for the pupil premium because their families have been in receipt of certain benefits in the previous few years. And once tests are reformed, it suggests children should be provided with at least 10 hours free, or subsidised preparation for entrance tests, so applicants from all backgrounds are given an even chance of success. Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: "Politicians of all parties have accepted that grammar schools are here to stay, and while their numbers are not growing, the number of pupils admitted to them has risen by a quarter, or 30,000, since 1997 and is likely to continue to grow in the years ahead. "Some grammar schools are working to improve access, and grammar schools in Northern Ireland have a far better record than English grammar schools." In his foreword to the report, he said: "The challenge to the sector and for those areas where a selective system prevails is how to ensure that those grammar schools are open to all, and are not simply a preserve of better-off families who can afford private tutors or prep schools fees." He added: "We need fairer tests and there should be a minimum of 10 hours free or subsidised test preparation for all applicants to provide a more level playing field." But National Grammar Schools Association chairman Robert McCartney said the fact that three-quarters of England had no grammar school meant that it was not fair to compare national figures on pupils on free school meals. He added that the report makes clear that grammar schools are a good thing and they are not going to go away. "Clearly since 1997 there have been an additional 300,000 pupils at the 164 grammar schools in England. That really means something like an extra 30 grammar schools with pupils of 1,000 each." He welcomed the idea that grammar schools provide test preparation classes to all pupils, but said it was impossible to design a written test that was not amenable to coaching. However, he agreed that many pupils found their way into grammar schools because they had been heavily coached for the tests. He added: "Grammar school heads report that many pupils have been totally over-coached and begin to struggle further up the school." He said the reason that this coaching industry had come about was because of the "paucity of grammar school places in England". The Department for Education did not wish to comment on the report. </body>

      <body>Ofsted has criticised educational attainment in Suffolk, saying standards in schools are "unacceptable". A letter to the county council follows inspections of 33 schools in September, prompted by concerns about overall education standards. Ofsted said there had been no overall increase in the number of good or outstanding schools in Suffolk. Suffolk County Council said recent Key Stage 2 and GCSE results showed it was "making progress". The council said its Raising The Bar programme had been designed to boost achievement in schools, but Ofsted found it was "regarded with varying degrees of credibility" by head teachers. The initiative was introduced in 2012 to try and improve standards, as figures revealed the county performed worse than comparable local education authorities (LEAs). The latest league tables showed that, out of 150 LEAS, Suffolk was in the bottom 10 for GCSE results and third from bottom for primary school performance. Ofsted said in its inspection of 33 schools in September, nearly a fifth were judged to be inadequate. Sean Harford, Ofsted regional director, said: "This is unacceptable and now means that Suffolk has a higher proportion of pupils educated in inadequate schools than both the regional and national averages. "The lack of progress of previously 'satisfactory' schools means that pupils in these schools still do not have access to a good quality of education. "This will be of great concern to parents, carers and pupils alike." Ofsted said that the number of schools that had improved to 'good' or 'better' had gone up, but not at the pace as the rest of the country. Inspectors found there were examples of effective intervention by the LEA, but it was "equally clear" some intervention had not been early enough. Last month, Suffolk County Council said it was going to approve a £2.4m spending package as part of its Raising the Bar school improvement policy. Ofsted said it also carried out a survey of head teachers of good or outstanding schools and its findings showed that, although they were aware of Raising The Bar, opinion was split on its credibility. Some head teachers said they had not been approached about playing a role in supporting other schools. Graham White, National Union of Teachers branch secretary for Suffolk, said: "Teaching standards are OK. "However, there are always going to be some that are really good and some that are less good. "We've got some outstanding teachers, heads and advisors in Suffolk, but we need to use them to much better effect." Ben Gummer, Conservative MP for Ipswich, said it was a "very helpful intervention" by Ofsted. "The same system of targets exists across the country and it has not stopped other areas improving more quickly than Suffolk," he said. "There are some exceptional teachers and good practice needs to be spread to the rest and that has to happen now rather than spread over a couple of years." A Suffolk County Council spokesperson said: "Improving educational attainment in Suffolk is the county council's top priority. "We're focused on making sure every child in Suffolk has the opportunity to fulfil their potential, which includes going to a good or outstanding school. "Through our Raising the Bar programme, we're working with and challenging schools to drive up educational attainment. "The latest Key Stage 2 and GCSE results show that Suffolk is making progress in the direction." </body>

      <title>'Student fees may reach £20,000'</title>

      <body>Some universities may eventually charge students from England up to £20,000 a year, a vice-chancellor has told the Times Higher Education magazine. Tuition fees paid by home students at English institutions are capped at £9,000, overseas students pay more. The sector may start to see both groups the same way, says Prof Nick Petford, of Northampton University His comments come as a report argues that universities will need more money to cope as demand for places rises. The report, published on Thursday by the umbrella group Universities UK (UUK), says that higher fees charged by universities since last year have merely replaced cuts to government funding. Some forecasts predict that the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000 within the next 20 years. The report says this means institutions will need extra money to invest in buildings and facilities if they are to compete with universities in other countries. Many universities are already relying on sources of income other than fees or government money to pay for new building projects, it says. Prof Petford is the third university vice-chancellor to argue that the cap on annual fees, currently set at a maximum of £9,000, will need to rise. Last week UUK president and Surrey University vice-chancellor Sir Christopher Snowden urged the government to allow fees to keep pace with inflation. In September the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Prof Andrew Hamilton, said fees should be related to the true cost of a degree - or £16,000 in the case of Oxford. Both said that some universities and departments were losing money, particularly on expensive courses such as science, technology or engineering. Prof Petford argues that some universities "with high brand value will be able to charge £17,000, £18,000 or £20,000 in the future - I am sure of that". "If you look at international students that's been a pretty much unregulated market since we've been recruiting overseas students," he said. "Universities have always been used to this sort of behaviour. "The big step change now is thinking about home students in this way." He agrees that universities could increasingly find themselves short of cash if the government maintains the £9,000 cap on fees. "It is quite easy to do a financial forecast which shows that if the cap remains at £9,000 in the next decade, a number of universities, including ours, could potentially be in financial difficulty." Prof Petford acknowledges it would not be easy for any political party to adopt a tuition fee rise as policy in the run-up to the next election. He said: "As a vote winner, it's just not going to work is it?" Any change in tuition fees would have to be agreed by Parliament. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills maintains that the current £9,000 maximum fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching and to invest in improved teaching facilities, while ensuring that going to university remains affordable for students. </body>

      <title>Global tests for schools in England</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in England will be able to compare their standards with top Asian countries, as individual schools are able to take international Pisa tests.</description>

      <body>Individual secondary schools in England will be able to take influential international tests to see how they compare with the highest performing schools in Asia and Europe. OECD Pisa tests are used to measure and compare the educational standards of developed countries around the world. But from next year individual schools will be able to test their 15-year-old pupils in reading, maths and science. It will allow schools to see how their pupils rank against global standards. Education Minister Liz Truss said it was an "excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems". Essex County Council said it is encouraging its schools to take part. Next month will see the publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) international league tables, based on Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests. These performance tables, which have become important international benchmarks, are published every three years, based on tests taken by a sample of schools in each country. The OECD says that such school standards are an important indicator for future economic performance. Asian countries have dominated the top places in recent test results, with Scandinavian countries among the high flyers in Europe. The UK has been a middle ranking performer, but within this national figure there will be a wide range of differences in ability, depending on region and type of school. It has raised questions such as how cities such as London might compare with New York or Paris, if there was data beyond the national level. The OECD is now going to allow individual schools in England to take the tests, so that they can see whether they are as good as pupils in Shanghai, Hong Kong or Finland, or whether they are falling behind the global competition. Making the test available will "enable individual schools in England for the first time to see where they stand internationally", says the OECD's education chief, Andreas Schleicher. "This will help teachers and school leaders understand where to focus their efforts to raise standards and learn from successful school systems in other countries." Schools will be given an overall test score, rather than a breakdown of individual pupils. And the school scores, from tests that take about two and a half hours, will not be published by the OECD. The test papers will be marked externally. Earlier this year this type of individual school testing was announced for the United States. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "It is down to secondary schools themselves to decide whether they want to take part in these tests run by a highly respected, independent organisation. "We see this is an excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems - and potentially against other schools from around the world." Ray Gooding, Essex County Council's cabinet member for education, said: "I will actively be encouraging Essex schools to take part to benefit from the ability to assess performance, share best practice and improve learning across the county." </body>

      <body>Many parents fear music videos have become too sexualised and violent, the founder of a parenting website has said. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, said parents were not prudes, but felt things had "gone too far". In a survey of some 1,500 website members, most (82%) said their children had repeated sexual lyrics without knowing their meaning. And three-quarters said they tried to stop children watching music videos. Ms Freegard said parents were most angry that their children were being exposed to "lewd viewing" on programmes shown before the 21:00 watershed for family viewing. "Modern parents aren't prudes - they know sex sells," she said. "But there's a strong feeling that things have gone too far now. It's toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to." Most (75%) of parents with daughters said very sexual pop acts were teaching girls they would be "judged on their looks, not their achievements or personality". About half of parents with sons said they were frightened explicit footage made them believe women were "too sexually available" and that they should have "unrealistic porn-star-style body shapes". About 1,500 members of the website opted to take part in the online survey last month, shortly after an outcry over the latest music video and performances by Miley Cyrus. The Irish singer Sinead O'Connor recently warned the former children's TV star not to let herself be exploited by the music business, sparking a row between the pair. Two-thirds of parents taking part said they thought young female singers were being exploited. Defending a recent controversial performance, Miley Cyrus said people were "over-thinking" what she had done and that she had been trying to "make history". </body>

      <title>Academy chains 'should face Ofsted'</title>
      <description>A report from the Education Select Committee says Ofsted should be given powers to inspect sponsors of groups of academies.</description>

      <body>Ofsted should be given powers to inspect organisations that run chains of academies, says a report from a cross-party committee of MPs. The Education Select Committee wants to improve the way groups of schools work together in partnerships. More than half of secondary schools in England are now academies, operating outside local authority control. Graham Stuart, committee chairman, said schools needed clearer incentives to "look beyond their own school gate". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has previously said he believes that sponsors of such academy chains should face inspections. A Department for Education spokesman said: "Ofsted already inspects all school and academy performance, while the Department for Education examines the performance of chains. "Where academies are underperforming, we take action - this can involve issuing a pre-warning notice and ultimately changing the sponsor if there is no improvement." The report by MPs has examined partnerships and co-operation between schools, against a background of greater school autonomy and different levels of accountability. Mr Stuart says his committee supports giving schools "more freedom to innovate" but there also needs to be a "degree of co-ordination". "Otherwise there is a danger that many schools will operate in isolation rather than in co-operation," said Mr Stuart. The report says that while there is widespread support for the idea of raising standards through greater collaboration there is still a lack of incentive for schools to work together. It argues that local authorities have a "critical role" in improving schools and calls on the government to clarify how they can act as brokers between local schools. But with the expansion of academies, it says that academy chains will play an increasingly important part in helping schools to improve. It warns of the need for co-ordination from this "middle tier", between individual schools and central government, particularly in areas where schools are at risk of underperforming. The Education Select Committee MPs say that academy chains should be open to inspection by Ofsted, in the way that local authorities can be inspected. The committee also argues there should be a mechanism to allow outstanding schools to leave academy chains, including without the approval of the organisation running the chain. The MPs also raise concerns that some outstanding academies are not providing support for weaker neighbouring schools and the report calls for closer monitoring. Sir Michael Wilshaw, giving evidence to the committee earlier this year, told MPs that there needed to be a level playing field in the accountability of organisations running groups of schools. "We will be inspecting local authorities and we should inspect academy chains as well, if we identify underperformance," said the Ofsted chief. "I have made that clear to the secretary of state. It is only fair and equitable that we do that. We have not got the same powers at the moment, but I look forward to receiving the powers to do that." Sir Michael told MPs that there was an "ongoing discussion" with the Department for Education, but he thought the principle had been accepted. He also backed the idea that academy chains could be ranked in performance tables in the same way as local authorities. There are now 3,444 academies, representing 53% of secondary schools and 9% of primaries in England. Among these there are 1,600 schools in academy chains, up from fewer than 900 in autumn 2012. "Hundreds of schools are now collaborating on a scale never witnessed before - brilliant heads and teachers are working together, sharing best practice and driving improvement throughout the system, raising standards for their pupils," said a Department for Education spokesman. Labour's schools minister Kevin Brennan said: "Labour has long argued that collaboration between schools is what is needed if we are to deliver a step-change in standards across all schools. In June, we said that all schools would have to demonstrate effective collaboration with weaker schools for them to be rated as outstanding by Ofsted. "This report - by a cross-party group of MPs - is a damning indictment of David Cameron's schools policy that drives competition between schools instead of incentivising partnerships between them." </body>

      <description>A female drama teacher is banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex and having 'inappropriate and sexually explicit' conversations with other children.</description>

      <body>A female drama teacher has been banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex. Lindsay Black, 28, sent texts, emails and Facebook messages to the boy, 17, who played a lead role in the school play "We Will Rock You". She asked him to meet up for sex after class at St Joseph's Roman Catholic High School, Newport. The disciplinary panel in Cardiff heard she had "inappropriate and sexually explicit" talks with other pupils. Miss Black asked her sixth form class "Who's a virgin?" and made pupils stand-up if they had not had sex. She also played a game called "I have never" with the pupils where she would ask them if they had performed sex acts. The hearing was told Miss Black then encouraged the teenagers to mime sex acts in class. The schoolboy, known as Pupil A, showed other pupils text messages from Miss Black as he rehearsed. English teacher Abigail Watts said: "I heard comments from other pupils about Miss Black liking pupils and I asked what this meant. "They said she had been Facebook messaging Pupil A - she told him she had a dream about them having sex. "They had not met up but they had been talking about it." Trained actress Miss Black met the teenager while working on maternity cover at the school. She contacted him on Facebook and asked about his coursework, then began sending him messages talking about sex and alcohol. A Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council of Wales heard she even asked the boy's girlfriend about their relationship. The hearing was told how Miss Black would spend time in classes talking to the students about sex acts. When Miss Black was confronted by the head of drama she told him it was just an exercise to get them into "character". Colleague Sandra Davies said: "Pupils told me that during drama classes Miss Black would talk about sex and she turned the lessons on to a sexual theme. "She said she wanted to cheat on her fiance once before getting married and that she fantasised about having sex on a table in the drama class." Ms Davies added the pupils played the "I have never" game. "She would then get the pupils to act out the acts in question," she added. The hearing in Cardiff was told how the boy's academic performance had suffered as a result of the messages and he had to re-sit his AS levels. Ms Black was interviewed by police following the allegations in 2011 but no further action was taken. She did not attend the hearing but admitted engaging in inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations with a pupil via social networking website Facebook. Ms Black denied talking to her class about sex and said the pupils had made up the allegations. But the panel found she had held discussions of an "inappropriate and sexually explicit nature" with Year 12 children. The panel found her actions amounted to unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching. Committee chairman Peter Williams said: "The conduct in question seriously affected pupils and was not an isolated lapse. "Black's actions are fundamentally incompatible with being a registered teacher." Paul Bennett, chair of governors at St Joseph's, said the school took allegations of unprofessional conduct "very seriously". He added: "The allegations were handled in line with the appropriate procedures. The school referred the matter to the General Teaching Council for Wales as it was required to do." </body>

      <title>Autism detectable 'in first months'</title>
      <description>Signs of autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>An early indication of autism can be identified in babies under six months old, a study suggests. US researchers, writing in Nature, analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism initially developed normally but showed diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - between two and six months of age. A UK expert said the findings raise hope for early interventions. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the life-long condition, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <title>A second language may delay dementia</title>
      <description>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual.</description>

      <body>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual, according to a study. Scientists examined almost 650 dementia patients and assessed when each one had been diagnosed with the condition. They found people who spoke two or more languages experienced a later onset of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. The bilingual advantage extended to illiterate people. The scientists said it confirmed the observed effect was not caused by differences in formal education. The study was by Edinburgh University and Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad in India. It is the largest study so far to gauge the impact of bilingualism on the onset of dementia, independent of a person's education, gender, occupation and whether they live in a city or in the country, all of which have been examined as potential factors influencing the onset of dementia. The team of researchers said further studies were needed to determine the mechanism, which causes the delay in the onset of dementia. The researchers suggested bilingual switching between different sounds, words, concepts, grammatical structures and social norms constituted a form of natural brain training, which was likely to be more effective than any artificial brain training programme. However, studies of bilingualism are complicated in that bilingual populations are often ethnically and culturally different from monolingual societies. In places like Hyderabad, bilingualism is part of everyday life, knowledge of several languages is the norm and monolingualism is an exception. Thomas Bak, of Edinburgh University's school of philosophy, psychology and language sciences said: "These findings suggest that bilingualism might have a stronger influence on dementia than any currently available drugs. "This makes the study of the relationship between bilingualism and cognition one of our highest priorities." The study is published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. </body>

      <title>Music lessons 'sculpt the brain'</title>
      <description>Learning a musical instrument as a child confers brain gains that last long into adult life, according to a small study.</description>

      <body>Learning a musical instrument as a child gives the brain a boost that lasts long into adult life, say scientists. Adults who used to play an instrument, even if they have not done so in decades, have a faster brain response to speech sounds, research suggests. The more years of practice during childhood, the faster the brain response was, the small study found. The Journal of Neuroscience work looked at 44 people in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The volunteers in the study listened to a synthesised speech syllable, "da", while researchers measured electrical activity in the region of the brain that processes sound information - the auditory brainstem. Despite none of the study participants having played an instrument in nearly 40 years, those who completed between four and 14 years of music training early in life had a faster response to the speech sound than those who had never been taught music. The study took place at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University in Illinois, US. As people grow older, they often experience changes in the brain that compromise hearing. For instance, the brains of older adults show a slower response to fast-changing sounds, which is important for interpreting speech. It could be that learning an instrument in childhood causes a fixed change in the brain that is retained throughout life. Or, music classes somehow prepare the brain for future auditory learning, say the researchers. Past work by the same team found younger adults were better listeners if they had been taught an instrument as a child. Experts also believe musical training - with an emphasis on rhythmic skills - can exercise the auditory-system. But these studies are all relatively small and cannot ascertain if it is definitely musical training that is causing the effect. Arguably, children offered the opportunity to learn an instrument, which can be expensive, may come from more privileged backgrounds and this may have an influence. Commenting on the study, Michael Kilgard from the University of Texas, who was not involved with the research, said: "Being a millisecond faster may not seem like much, but the brain is very sensitive to timing and a millisecond compounded over millions of neurons can make a real difference in the lives of older adults." </body>

      <title>'Government risks teacher shortage'</title>
      <description>Lack of detail in the government's figures for its teacher training plans for next year may hide possible teacher shortages, claims a university expert.</description>

      <body>Lack of detail in the government's figures for its teacher training plans for next year may hide possible teacher shortages, claims a university expert. Figures published last Friday lack crucial details, says James Noble-Rogers of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET). Mr Rogers says he fears such details may reveal key shortages of trainees. The government said it planned to publish a detailed breakdown of the figures "in the next few weeks". Mr Rogers has issued a freedom of information request to the government for the data. He says Friday's figures failed to give details of how the government has allocated numbers by subject or of how many trainee places have been allocated for secondary or primary education. "This information has been published as a matter of course in the past", he writes in a letter to the schools minister, David Laws. "It should not be necessary in an open democracy for UCET or anyone else to resort to legislation to obtain information of this kind." Last week's figures revealed how many teachers the government plans to train next year. They also showed a further switch in funding for teacher training from universities to the School Direct scheme which allows teachers to learn largely on the job in schools, but with theoretical and specialist training provided by universities. The figures showed that 41,100 teachers would be trained in the year starting September 2014, rising from 38,900 this year. Of these the numbers trained by Schools Direct will rise from 9,600 in the current academic year to 15,400 in 2014. The numbers trained on postgraduate university courses will fall from 20,000 this year to 16,200 next year. Overall, Mr Rogers says this represents a rise in the numbers trained by School Direct from 25% to 37%. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that detailed allocations, including a breakdown by subject, would be published within the next few weeks "once they have been confirmed by universities and schools. "School Direct has built on many excellent long-standing relationships between schools and universities. "We want these relationships to continue to give applicants plenty of choice about their preferred route into teaching. "Higher education institutions are involved in seven in 10 School Direct places "We hit 95% of our recruitment target this year." The spokeswoman added that three candidates applied for every School Direct place last year, and that requests from schools for School Direct places had "shot up from 9,600 to 17,700 in the past year". Mr Rogers told BBC News said the broken down data was usually issued at the same time as the overall figures. He said the delay this year would make it difficult for training providers, particularly universities, to plan. "The only apparent reason it should now be kept secret is to prevent a timely and legitimate analysis of data before allocations are finalised", says the letter to Mr Laws. In August, analysis of School Direct recruitment figures by Prof John Howson of Oxford Brookes University suggested a possible shortfall in the numbers of science and maths specialists. </body>

      <title>Two-year-olds 'should start school'</title>
      <description>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested.</description>

      <body>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged families should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested. Many children from poor backgrounds have a "dire" start to their education, according to Baroness Sally Morgan. They can be up to a year and a half behind their better-off classmates by the age of five, she said. The Pre-School Learning Alliance described Lady Morgan's suggestion as "beyond belief". "Who would disagree with Sally Morgan that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need considerably more support. However, to suggest that placing two and three-year-olds in schools is the answer is beyond belief. "Social inequality needs to addressed in many ways and taking very young children away from their parents and placing them in formal schooling is not the answer," said Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch. Mr Leitch added that international research put the UK's specialist early years network of childminders and nurseries among the world's best. "I am struggling to understand why anyone would promote pushing our youngest, most vulnerable children into schools rather than using the existing network of specialist local provision offered by childminders and group settings," he said. The government said it was making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two. Speaking at an event organised by an academy chain, Lady Morgan argued that poor parenting, poor diet and poor housing meant disadvantaged children were often not ready to start formal schooling at five. She called for a "big brave move" in early years education, with more nurseries attached to schools and a particular focus on the poorest children. She said more schools should become "all through", taking pupils from age three or younger to age 18. Her comments echo a recent Ofsted report which suggested that poor five-year-olds are 19 months behind their more affluent peers. "What a dire start to their educational life," said Lady Morgan. "Those children had low level social skills especially reading and communication. "They're not ready to learn at school. Weak parenting, low educational attainment of parents, poor diet, poor housing and so on. "The gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group. "No-one has yet got a grip on this problem", she said. "I think there needs to be a big brave move on the under-fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly, I think, to look to strong providers to go further down the system. We've increasingly got five-to-18 schools, why not three-to-18?" A Department for Education spokeswoman responded: "We know that teacher-led early years education has a positive impact on children, especially on those from low income backgrounds. "That is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with Ofsted when doing so, and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two-year-olds." The spokeswoman said government reforms would ensure all children, regardless of background, get a good start in life with all three- and four-year-olds entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. Educational Psychologist Dr Jo van Herwegen of Kingston University said formal learning risked damaging children's development if started too early. "It's really all about what you define as being 'school' education and the government needs to understand that children learn through play at this young age. "Formal learning is extremely difficult as children's working memory and language abilities are still developing, "Forcing children to learn in formal settings and sit tests regularly can risk creating performance anxiety and an aversion to learning later on in life". Wendy Ellyat of the Save Childhood Movement said the key was to "prioritise child-flourishing and well-being over educational attainment", whether children were with childminders or in schools or nurseries. "We also need to look at how best to support parents as the most important thing for such young children is to have stable, loving and supportive home lives." </body>

      <title>Students offered paid internships</title>
      <description>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates.</description>

      <body>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates. The University of Leicester says they will be available to students based in the UK or EU starting degree courses in 2014 and will last up to 12 weeks each. The aim is to give students insight into what employers want from recruits and to compete in a global jobs market. "Crucially we want our students to be able to adapt to the challenges they face when they leave", said career development manager Raj Patel. The university says the scheme will be the first of its kind offered by any top-20 higher education institution in the UK. All the internships will pay the equivalent of £12,000 to £16,000 a year pro rata, says the university. Some will be within the university's own departments, others will be in the private sector. Bob Athwal, director of career development, said a growing number of employers were using student internships "to feed their talent pipeline". The new scheme will involve an application and selection process, with a programme of workshops to help students prepare. The university has promised the interview process will provide "every campus-based home or EU student with an opportunity during their degree". Mr Athwal says this idea is to showcase "a rich pool of talent" among Leicester undergraduates. The graduate jobs market has been tight in recent years. Figures produced by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) in July this year forecast a 4% fall in graduate vacancies, with leading UK employers reporting an average of 85 applications for each job. A separate survey of more than 18,000 university leavers, published in June, suggested graduates who had had internships were three times more likely to get jobs. The study by High Fliers research found that more than one in three students had completed work experience or internships with a prospective employer. </body>

      <title>Forced academies 'costing too much'</title>
      <description>An internal document leaked to the BBC suggests ministers are prepared to force schools to become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits.</description>

      <body>Ministers are making struggling schools become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits, a leaked government document suggests. Civil servants planning for budget cuts at the education department suggested ministers consider value for money before forcing academy conversions. But Education Secretary Michael Gove overruled this cash-saving idea as "totally wrong", the document reveals. The education department says academies are the best way of improving schools. But the National Union of Teachers said Mr Gove's "pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost". Academies are privately run schools funded by the state in England. They have control over their own admissions, and increased freedoms over what they teach and pay staff. They can get up to £110,000 in start-up costs. Where underperforming schools are unwilling to convert to academy status, it is enforced in several steps - including sacking the governors and replacing them with a hand-picked interim governing body. Ultimately the secretary of state can issue an academy order requiring a change in the school's management. The Department for Education (DfE) sees the academies programme as its key engine of school improvement, but critics have described the process as heavy-handed and undemocratic. The DfE plans to cut its administrative budget by £290m by 2015-16. The document, entitled What Stops at the DfE, looks at where savings could be made. It says forced conversions are "very resource intensive" and reveals that the government's underperformance strategy is in need of extra funds. But despite tight department budgets, it is clear that conversions where the costs outweigh the benefits - often where there is strong opposition to a change - are still being pushed through. The document suggests more account should be taken of a "cost-benefit analysis" in "determining the approach to academisation of underperforming schools". But it stresses that the secretary of state does not want to see such value-for-money checks on the programme and that the changes have not been made. It adds that ministers had expected to see some schools or heads change their mind about becoming academies as a result of high profile cases such as that of Downhills Primary School, which it cites as an example. Mr Gove ordered the Haringey school be taken over by an academy chain, despite 94% of parents opposing the move, and claims that it was already on a trajectory of improvement when the conversion was being proposed. Legal action was threatened as a result and teachers walked out on strike. But the document says: "Achieving success in difficult areas has a bigger potential pay-off and is important for the reputation and reach of the overall programme but both this and forced conversions are very resource intensive." And it warns: "If we limit the number of forced interventions there is a risk that we don't tackle the worst performing schools (which would not otherwise become academies)." It is also clear that the DfE is seeking extra cash to ensure the forced academies programme is maintained. It talks about "securing the additional resource needed for the underperformance strategy" and says it will not place "any arbitrary limits on forced conversion activity". And indeed the document is peppered with references to how money can be transferred from the oversight of maintained schools so that the "increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time work on a new admissions code, which the document says might prove inevitable because of various pressures, has been axed. And oversight of boarding schools and home education is being downgraded despite civil servant warnings that there could be child protection risks as a result. A DfE spokesman said: "Ministers are clear we will not stand by when a school is failing its pupils, and that the strong support of a proven sponsor is the best way to see rapid and sustainable improvements. "While it is vital that government constantly considers ways to cut bureaucracy and save public money, we make no apology for prioritising improving the education of children in the country's worst performing schools." National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower said: "Despite civil servants identifying the forced academy programme as an activity that could be cut back in order to address the disproportionate cost to the public purse, this document makes clear that ideology won out over sound public policy decision making. "It is increasingly evident that Michael Gove's pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost. "At a time when school budgets elsewhere are being cut is really quite an inappropriate use of public finances." David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said: "In many cases, giving more flexibility to local areas to take swift action, for instance by recruiting new governors and staff, would be a better and more cost effective way of improving standards. "Councils want to be able to intervene more quickly and effectively in poorly performing schools but are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. "Money spent on conversion costs could be saved by enabling earlier intervention by councils who are focused on school performance rather than management structures." </body>

      <description>Three single mothers and their children lose a challenge to the government's benefits cap, with the High Court ruling it does not breach their human rights.</description>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <title>Biggest educator you've never heard of</title>
      <description>The biggest education provider you've never heard of</description>

      <body>This is the biggest education provider you've never heard of. Until now. The Alison project - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - has already signed up more than two million students to more than 500 online courses. It's adding another 200,000 each month and founder Mike Feerick is confident this expansion could accelerate even more rapidly and reach a billion students towards the end of the decade. But this ambitious project isn't another Silicon Valley spin-off, fuelled by venture capital and a surfeit of sunshine and flow charts. This global digital empire is based in a technology park in Galway in the west of Ireland. If there was such a thing as successful grey skies thinking, on a damp autumn day, this would be a prime location. But Alison's days in the shade could be numbered, as it has won a prestigious international award this week at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar. The online learning platform has already won an innovation award from Unesco. So how has it stayed below the radar? While the new wave of online courses - so-called Moocs, such as Coursera and edX, have become darlings of the digital media, why has Alison not had the same attention? Mr Feerick says the big difference is who they are trying to reach. It's the academic versus vocational divide being played out in the digital market. "The people we're helping do not have a huge voice," says Mr Feerick. While the Moocs are associated with high-status universities, Alison's focus is on the vast numbers of people around the world needing to improve their vocational skills and training. There are courses in subjects such as computer skills, learning English, basic accountancy, building a website, food safety, immunology, introductions to legal studies. He is planning to expand into secondary school level, with video lessons customised for national exam systems, beginning with maths. Organisations from the IMF to the OECD to the European Union have all spoken of the urgency of providing vocational, workplace skills to tackle dangerously high levels of youth unemployment. But Alison has been putting this into practice. A deal struck earlier this year will provide online training for 12 million young people in the Arab world. Many of those accessing the free courses are at the margins of formal education - low-skilled workers, the unemployed and immigrants. Within the coming months, India is expected to become the biggest source of learners, overtaking the UK and US. Nigeria and the Philippines are rapidly growing markets. Mr Feerick wants to use online technology to offer free lessons in the most important basic skills that people need. As he puts it, 99% of the people are learning the same 1% of information, again and again. His other challenge to the established order, heresy to some, is to question the necessity of exam certificates. If people are studying for a specific skill, such as learning to touch-type or a language, he argues the key question is whether they can put the lessons into practice. He says the fixation with a paper trail of certification is part of protecting an educational status quo. "They desperately want to keep the same system." Alison's other big difference is that it is profitable. The courses are free because of advertising revenue. The social mission is underpinned by a strong business sense. Mr Feerick says his approach to social entrepreneurship was influenced by his own business mentor, Chuck Feeney, a celebrated US investor in ideas and education, who took him under his wing when Mr Feerick had been studying at Harvard. Mr Feeney is a famously frugal and publicity-shy billionaire and philanthropist, who is currently helping to fund New York's hi-tech science campus. Inspired by his example, Mr Feerick says he wanted to combine thinking big commercially while maintaining a sense of social purpose. The idea of free education online, available around the globe, became his focus. "Education underpins all social progress. It's the tool of the most ambitious revolutionary in these technological times, you can change the world if you can change education." He sees the internet as making an irresistible impact on education, in the way it has in other industries, with a few giants emerging to dominate the multi-trillion dollar education market. "There is going to be huge consolidation worldwide into a small number of platforms for learning, because it's going to be very hard to compete with them," he predicts, likening it to how Amazon has become the global bookseller. "So these platforms are going to be huge, some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world." There are other projects challenging the idea that online learning should be dominated by prestigious Western universities. The Kepler project, launched in September, is using online technology to bring university lessons to Rwanda, to students who otherwise would have no chance of getting into higher education. Using laptops they can take lectures and resources from top universities putting course material online. In the Rwandan campus there are local teachers who are able to provide face-to-face lessons, with a ratio of 30 students for each member of staff. If they successfully complete their course they can get a US accredited degree. There are 50 students in a pilot phase, being charged $1,000 per year. If it works, this will expand rapidly and the longer-term aim is to reach 7,000 to 10,000 students. "There is a rising demand for higher education in Africa that can't be met by traditional models," says Jamie Hodari, chief executive of the non-profit organisation. The economy in Rwanda is growing, but if it wants to compete with other countries it is severely limited by low levels of education. "They have completely hit a wall," says Mr Hodari. Rwanda has ambitions to become a regional technology hub, but it lacks a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. At present, Mr Hodari says "so many children leave as the top of their class and go on to become taxi drivers, because there is no other pathway". The Kepler idea reflects the way that technology is dismantling the component parts of education - separating the local teaching from the online course materials and the international accreditation. If the format works, Mr Hodari says it could be replicated in other parts of Africa and beyond. It could be a "university in a box" that others could copy, he says. "The playbook will be right there in front of them." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <title>Why we're afraid of 'zombie' faces</title>
      <description>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist.</description>

      <body>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist. A research project by the Open University's Stephanie Lay found a particular fear of "near-human" faces. It explains why blank eyes, automatons, masks and ventriloquists' dolls are common cinema devices to instil fear. The psychologist says a study of 3,000 people found widespread "repulsion" at near-human faces. The finding is part of research into the so-called "uncanny valley" phenomenon in how people react to robots. The effect was discovered in the 1970s in research into whether giving robots human features would make them more reassuring to humans working with them or using them in the home. The research found that people were initially more receptive to robots which were made slightly human looking, but if they began to imitate humans too closely, people were repelled. Instead of being reassured, too close a resemblance to a human form was seen as sinister. Mrs Lay's research is examining this "uncanny valley" effect from a psychological perspective. She describes it as "the sense of unease that accompanies the sight of something almost, but not quite, human". It is the sudden plunge in reaction at a point just before a face is fully humanised. For instance the empty eyes of a zombie figure in an otherwise human face is highly disconcerting. And it explains why the faces of dolls, clowns and dummies are used so regularly to frighten audiences. "A consistent finding of the survey was people's reactions to images where the face was convincingly human but with lifeless eyes or where eerily human eyes appeared in a non-human face," says Mrs Lay. "These were perceived to be the most uncanny and disturbing of all the images and explain why characters such as zombies in horror films unsettle people to such great effect." This is particularly the case with psychological horror films, she says, rather than bloodthirsty shockers. She says this uneasy reaction could be caused by the sudden disruption in how the human brain processes human faces. When people begin to interpret something as a human face, they are left with a sense of disquiet when they come against something that does not match their expectations. Being able to "read" another person's eyes is particularly important in this process of interpreting faces, she says. "It may be that our normal processing mechanisms are not being engaged for these faces, causing the unsettling effect when people want to like a near-human face, but realise something is wrong." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>Engineering gap 'constrains' economy</title>
      <description>The UK's economic recovery could be constrained by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser.</description>

      <body>The UK's economic recovery could be "constrained" by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser. Prof John Perkins, chief scientific adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has identified "a substantial demand for engineers". He has issued "a call to action" to government, industry and educators to "step up" to inspire future engineering talent and address skills shortages. Business Secretary Vince Cable said too few teenagers were studying science. "Engineers must have a strong foundation in maths and science, especially physics. "The number of young people choosing these subjects post-16 is relatively low, especially amongst women," said Mr Cable. In his Review of Engineering Skills, Prof Perkins says the UK already relies on "inward migration" to fill skilled jobs in key sectors such as oil and gas extraction, aerospace, and computer, electronic and optical engineering. "This should not be our long-term solution. "We should support the UK's young people by preparing them to compete for highly paid, skilled engineering jobs, improving their career prospects and reducing the need to import engineering skills," says the review. It calls for "purposeful and effective early intervention to enthuse tomorrow's engineers" and ensure they have the "solid academic foundations to engage in the subject". The report calls for as many young people as possible to study "rigorous curricula in maths and science". In particular it says the UK lags behind its competitors in the number of 16- to 18-year-olds studying maths. Prof Perkins says the profession suffers "from widespread misconceptions and lack of visibility that deter young people, and especially girls from pursuing it as a career". The report refers to polling carried out for the Tomorrow's Engineers Week campaign, which suggests that only half of 11- to 14-year olds would consider a career in engineering. This dropped to 35% among girls and only 24% of parents of girls said they thought engineering was a suitable profession for their daughters. Prof Perkins draws "some comfort that we are heading in the right direction" with initiatives to inspire future engineers, a focus on maths and science in schools, more apprenticeships and "our continued strength in higher education". His 22 recommendations urge both short and long term action to "get the right messages to young people" - particularly girls, to ensure vocational training is high quality and high status and that "higher education continues to deliver". The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it was making available nearly £49m to boost engineering skills. From January some £30m of this money will allow employers to bid for match-funding for training schemes to address specific engineering skills shortages. Another £18m will fund an elite training facility in Coventry, while Tomorrow's Engineers will get £250,000 to encourage schoolchildren into engineering. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, which represents almost 6,000 companies, said: "The report rightly shines the spotlight on the need for a pipeline of talented future engineers, with credible recommendations on how this can be achieved. "Whilst this is a long-term task, the message from employers is clear - we are ready to take on the challenge." Anne Spackman of the charity Career Academies which runs internship schemes to prepare schoolchildren for employment said efforts to "grow the number of potential recruits" into engineering were crucial. "Engineering is an area rich in job opportunities but lacking the skilled workers to fill them," said Ms Spackman. </body>

      <title>London online course draws 200,000</title>
      <description>The first annual figures from a UK online course show a high initial take-up, but also a high dropout rate.</description>

      <body>More than 200,000 students signed up for the first wave of online courses offered by the University of London's International Programmes. The university has published details of the take-up of four online courses - so-called Moocs - in their first year. This also showed the high dropout rate with only about 9,000 students completing a course. Mike Kerrison, director of academic development, said the the experiment so far had been "very successful". The University of London's International Programmes specialises in providing degrees by distance learning and has been providing such courses since the 19th Century. Last year it became one of the UK's early adopters of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses - which deliver university courses through the internet. It offered free courses through the US-based Coursera network, which now has more than five million registrations. This snapshot from the University of London's International Programmes at the end of the first year shows the scale of interest in such online courses, with 210,000 students signing up. Reflecting the demand for higher education, this is about four times the total number of conventional students studying with the University of London's International Programmes. Among those people who signed up, 90,000 were categorised as "active students" who participated in one of the four pilot courses, which were about computer programming, law, malicious software and the use of photography. The university says there was a strong sense of value from students, with 91% rating their experience as good, very good or excellent. These online courses, with no formal entry requirements, have a high dropout rate, and in this case there were 8,843 students who received a "Statement of Accomplishment" for successful completion, fewer than one in 20 of those who initially signed up. "Considering that the courses are free and allow students to do as much or as little work as they like, the number of students engaging in the course materials is considerable," said Mr Kerrison. There has been particular interest in online universities in the US, where prestigious institutions such as Harvard, MIT and Stanford have been at the forefront of creating online platforms such as Coursera and edX. These have also spread into international networks with major recent partnerships in China and France. The online model has also begun to be refined, with Harvard developing courses for a much smaller, pre-selected group of online students, with the aim of much higher completion rates. These have been dubbed Spocs, small private online courses. This autumn also saw the launch of a UK online university partnership, Futurelearn, which has announced new courses starting in January, bringing to 29 the total number of courses available. This includes Shakespeare's Hamlet: text, performance and culture, from the University of Birmingham and Exploring our oceans, from the University of Southampton. So far Futurelearn has attracted students from 190 countries with five of the pilot courses already reaching their planned quotas. Chief executive Simon Nelson said the response in this first term had "exceeded all our expectations". </body>

      <title>GCSE overhaul in England made final</title>
      <description>Exams regulator Ofqual confirms it is making changes to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation.</description>

      <body>Exams regulator Ofqual has confirmed the changes it is making to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. A new grading system will use numbers instead of letters, and coursework is being scrapped for most subjects. The changes will be in stages, starting with pupils due to take GCSE exams in 2017. Those who turn 13 in this academic year will be the first. English and maths will be the first subjects affected. Pupils will begin studying the new courses in English language, English literature and maths from the autumn of 2015. And about 20 other popular GCSE subjects will be revamped in the same way, ready for teaching a year later, in 2016, with the first exams for those taken in 2018. The changes apply to England only. Wales is planning its own GCSE shake-up, but Northern Ireland is not planning any changes. Scotland has its own exams system. While they come in, pupils in England will have some exams graded with numbers and some with letters, leading teaching unions to warn this will be confusing for pupils, parents and employers. Exams will be graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest. Pupils who fail will be awarded a "U" for an unclassified result. All exams will be taken after two years of study, rather than in modules taken at various stages over two years, meaning a return to the format of O-levels, which pre-dated GCSEs. And there will be more marks awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar. The head of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said the changes were "fundamental". "This is the biggest change in a generation," she said. "They [GCSEs] have been around for over 25 years but now we are seeing fresh content, a different structure, high-quality assessment coming in. "It's a significant change for students and for schools." Ms Stacey said the move to a numerical system meant a new grade was being added and that would help examiners distinguish between candidates' performance - especially at the top grades. She suggested that the move away from traditional grades might be hard for some people to understand, but was important. "The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly," she said. At the same time, the government is confirming changes to what has to be studied in English language, English literature and maths, because the overhaul of exams covers both what is studied and how it is assessed. It says in English literature, students will have to "study whole texts in detail, covering a range of literature including Shakespeare, 19th Century novels, Romantic poetry and other high-quality fiction and drama". The new maths exam will cover more topics and will be more challenging, the government says. Details were released on Friday morning. For maths, Ofqual is keeping the present arrangement where pupils can be entered for either a higher- or lower-tier paper in maths, depending on their ability. But in English, that division has been scrapped and one exam will be taken by all. At the moment, students who are entered for easier papers can be awarded only the maximum of a C grade. The government says young people were let down by the old exam system; that frequent testing meant not enough time was spent on "deep learning" and not enough attention was paid to grammar, spelling and punctuation. Schools Minister Elizabeth Truss says the changes will improve students' "core skills" in maths and English and raise expectations. "What we want to do is encourage schools to focus on those core skills that employers really want, because that is what is going to help our children get jobs when they leave school," she said. Headteachers' representative, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), gave what it said was a "cautious welcome" to the changes. Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said: "There is much to welcome in today's announcement, especially the measured approach Ofqual has taken to this significant task. "We have always agreed that GCSE can be improved to better prepare students to meet the needs of the world we live in today. But the constant tinkering with GCSEs we have had in the past has not been helpful." Unions representing classroom teachers warned that a shift away from coursework and having different levels of exams for different abilities could damage some pupils' education. Secondary school teacher and spokesman for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Jovan Trkulja, said that less able students could suffer. "Exams are challenging and they should continue to be challenging. But we have to remember that setting the top of the mountain as the baseline means someone has to fall behind, and I feel for the sense of failure for the less able," he said. Shadow schools minister, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, said he had "reservations" about some aspects of the changes and that the move towards a numbered grading system was a step back to the 1970s. He said he agreed that the pendulum "might have swung a little too far on coursework", but there was now a danger that "it will swing too far the other way". "Having everything staked on one final exam is not great for all pupils," he said. </body>

      <body>University tuition fees in England should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged. Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey and president of Universities UK, says a £9,000 fee cap is "not sustainable". "The whole issue is that fees can't remain frozen for ever", he told Times Higher Education magazine. The National Union of Students (NUS) said last year's trebling in fees had already far outpaced rising costs. Sir Christopher's comments follow a recent call from the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Andrew Hamilton, for undergraduate fees to be "more closely related to the true cost" of a degree at Oxford, £16,000. Last month Prof Hamilton said the funding shortfall meant Oxford faced an annual funding gap of £70m. Sir Christopher said that Surrey had "several subjects where we are losing substantial sums of money teaching UK and EU students". He said these included science, technology and engineering courses. Sir Christopher added: "On aggregate the £9,000 was perhaps a reasonable starting point, but it really needs to have a sensible indexing linked to it." He said that the £9,000 maximum fees paid by students would be worth only around £8,250 by 2016 when inflation was factored in. However, Sir Christopher told the magazine that he was not an advocate of a major jump in fees: "I don't think that £16,000 is a likely scenario in the near future." Universities UK will publish a report next week on the future of university financing. This is expected to look at how universities will fund a predicted 26% rise in demand for university places within the next 20 years. Universities Minister David Willetts has said a rising birthrate will mean the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000. The paper is expected to explore where universities will find the capital to expand their facilities and accommodation. Universities UK points out that the rise in tuition fees paid by students was accompanied by a corresponding cut in the level of government funding for universities. The NUS said suggestions that undergraduates should pay more were unlikely to win sympathy from students or their parents. Union president Toni Pearce said: "What seems to have been missed here is the inflation-busting increases on the upper limit on tuition fees just last year, when the cap was nearly tripled to an eye-watering £9,000. "We've already seen a huge shift onto the shoulders of individuals through higher fees that far outpace rising costs. "Students and their families are facing a huge financial squeeze. The value of both earnings and student financial support is falling in real terms and the cost of making ends meet is increasing by the day." The government said its reforms had put the higher education sector on a more sustainable footing. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We believe the £9,000 fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching, with many institutions now planning to invest more in improved teaching facilities for students. "We want to ensure that going to university remains affordable for students and it is based on their ability, not their ability to pay." </body>

      <title>Not reporting abuse 'must be crime'</title>
      <description>Teachers and other professionals who fail to report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the former director of public prosecutions says.</description>

      <body>Teachers and other professionals who do not report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the ex-director of public prosecutions says. Keir Starmer said under a British "mandatory reporting" law, those who failed to act could be sent to jail. Declassified files uncovered by BBC Panorama show how schools have repeatedly failed to protect children from sex offenders. But the government said mandatory reporting was not the answer. While statutory guidance has been issued previously urging professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report child abuse, failure to do so is not a crime in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1967 makes it an offence to fail to disclose an arrestable offence - including those against children - to police. Mr Starmer, who was succeeded as director of public prosecutions by Alison Saunders on Friday, said it was time to "plug a gap in the law" that had been there for a "very, very long time". "If you're in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, and you have cause to believe that a child has been abused, or is about to be abused, you really ought to do something about it," he said. He said a criminal penalty would "focus people's minds" and said there should be "immunity for individuals if they did report". He said the penalty for failing to report abuse could be a short jail sentence or a fine. "There are just too many examples of cases where those who have suspected abuse have not really done anything about it and the perpetrator has either got away with it or, worse still, been able to perpetuate the offending." He added: "I would have a reasonably broad category of individuals that were subject to the law. "Obviously school teachers, but others in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, including other educational institutions, even sporting institutions." Similar laws are already in places in countries including the US, Canada and Australia. For the first time, the Catholic Church and the Church of England have also come out in support of mandatory reporting. Bishop Paul Butler, head of safeguarding at the Church of England, said: "We have to think of the child first, not ourselves, not the institution, what's best for the child." But the government has no plans to change the law. The Department for Education said professionals "should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child". "This happens every year in many thousands of cases and numbers of referrals have increased over recent years," it added. "Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children." And Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the Action for Children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are not convinced that making it mandatory will do what we need it to do." She said the reporting of child abuse in the UK was on the rise and that a "huge issue" was that "teachers and people across the system are not sufficiently trained to see those early signs of abuse". It was important they knew how to spot those signs "and not to feel that they may be prosecuted if they don't", she added. But Jonathan West, of the Mandate Now coalition of charities, welcomed Mr Starmer's call, adding that "social services can't actually act on cases they haven't been told about". He added: "Schools, other organisations, often don't really want to have a child abuse scandal on their hands. "It is surprisingly common that schools want to handle such things in house." Ever since the Jimmy Savile revelations, Panorama has been investigating secret historical records and looking at what government officials knew about abuse in children's homes and boarding schools. Declassified government files going back 60 years show how senior civil servants were well aware that school authorities routinely hid child abuse - preferring instead to protect the reputation of their own institutions - and the law was an inadequate deterrent. One of the most detailed historical files in the National Archives is about a cover-up at the Royal Alexandra and Albert school. Today it is a well-regarded state boarding school in Reigate, Surrey. However, research by Panorama has revealed that seven child abusers worked at the school between the 1950s and the 1980s.

      <body>Internet forums and chatrooms can have positive effects that should be more widely acknowledged, experts say. The call comes after Oxford University researchers carried out an analysis of 14 different studies looking at how young people use the internet. The review - published in the Plos One journal - said a number of studies had found a link between internet use and self-harm and suicide. But it said others had found the internet could be a positive influence. The dangers of internet use have received widespread coverage this year. In one case, in August, 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire was found hanged after she had been sent abusive messages on a social networking site. Since then research by the NSPCC has suggested a fifth of 11 to 16-year-olds have had negative experiences using the internet. The Oxford University research highlighted a number of dangers from internet use, including the normalising of self-harm and the risk of bullying. It also said there was a "strong link" between internet forums and an increased risk of suicide in particular. But the researchers said some studies had shown that internet forums could support and connect socially isolated people. There were also examples where forum users encouraged positive behaviour, advised others to seek help and congratulated each other for not harming themselves. Report author Prof Keith Hawton said: "Communication via the internet and other electronic means has potential roles in both contributing to and preventing suicidal behaviour in young people. "The next step is going to be development of therapeutic interventions using these channels of communication, especially to access those who do not seek help from clinical services." Joe Ferns of the Samaritans added: "We should acknowledge that many people are using suicide forums and chatrooms to anonymously discuss their feelings of distress and despair, including suicidal thoughts, which may have a positive impact on the individual. They may be expressing feelings that they have never disclosed to anyone in their offline lives. "Rather than concentrating primarily on ways of blocking and censoring such sites, we should think about online opportunities to reach out to people in emotional distress." </body>

      <title>Ed Balls attacks Shoesmith payout</title>
      <description>A six-figure payout to former Haringey children's services head Sharon Shoesmith "leaves a bad taste in the mouth", says shadow chancellor Ed Balls.</description>

      <body>A six-figure payout to the ex-head of Haringey children's services "leaves a bad taste in the mouth," shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said. Sharon Shoesmith, who earned £133,000 a year, won a ruling in 2011 that she was unfairly sacked after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter. BBC Newsnight revealed the payout could cost Haringey Council up to £600,000. In a statement Ms Shoesmith bid a "final farewell" to Haringey, adding she hoped to resume work with children. Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old, died in 2007 after months of abuse. The boy had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Three people were jailed in 2009, including his mother. The Court of Appeal concluded Ms Shoesmith had been "unfairly scapegoated" and her removal from office in December 2008 by the then Children's Secretary Ed Balls had been "intrinsically unfair and unlawful". One government source told BBC Newsnight that the cost to Haringey Council could be as high as £600,000, although Ms Shoesmith is expected to receive a lower sum. The exact figure may not emerge as there are confidentiality clauses preventing its disclosure but it will be significantly short of the £1m figure it had been reported she was seeking. However, it would appear the package is more than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested Ms Shoesmith was entitled to a minimum of three months' salary plus pensions contributions. Three months' salary would have been about £33,000. Mr Balls said his decision in 2008 as children's secretary to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her job had been right. He told the BBC: "An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services. "They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department, and responsible, ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money." Earlier, Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the payout became "inevitable" after the Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Balls "had made a complete botched job of her dismissal". But he added: "This is going to leave a really bad taste in taxpayers' mouths that a not insubstantial amount of public money is being used to pay off somebody who presided over a dysfunctional department in Haringey [where] a 17-month-old boy died in horrific circumstances." Care minister Norman Lamb said what happened in the aftermath of the Baby P's death was "extraordinary" but he was not in a position to judge the authority's decisions. "But it is pretty shocking, the scale of the reported payout, given what tragedy unfolded in that particular borough." In her statement, posted on an online networking site, Ms Shoesmith said: "A final farewell to Haringey as my case concludes. I wish those of you in children's services, especially in Haringey, success, strength and courage in all that you do. "Children have been my life's work and I hope to continue in some capacity soon now that my PhD is almost complete." A statement from Haringey Council confirmed it had reached a settlement with Ms Shoesmith but that the terms of the settlement were confidential and it was unable to comment further. Some of the cash will come from central government, but Haringey council will foot most of the bill, it is understood. An exact figure is yet to be agreed. The Department for Education declined to comment on the story when contacted by the BBC. But one source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was "furious" about the secrecy over the amount paid to Ms Shoesmith, believing it to be "indefensible". Downing Street said the Department for Education's contribution to the payout would be made public. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Ms Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a settlement since the May 2011 ruling. Ms Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Peter Connelly's mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child's death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

Free schools and academies are currently exempt from the government's nutritional guidelines, but research found 92% of parents wanted to see the same standards applied to all schools. The chair of the Lead Association for Catering in Education said people still remember soggy cabbage and lumpy custard, but reckoned "there has been really good hard work" to improve the food, and that: "We are finally cooking on gas".

      <title>Is there an 'angst canon' of books that teenagers read?</title>
      <description>Do teenagers still read the same rite of passage books?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24833198</url>

      <body>It's 100 years since the birth of Albert Camus. His book The Outsider is one of a select set of works that generations of disaffected teenagers have turned to as a rite of passage. The 1942 novel, also known as The Stranger, is about a French Algerian's seemingly irrational murder of an Arab and his subsequent indifference to his own execution. Central character Meursault is a man alienated from the society in which he lives. There's The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. Central character Holden is alienated from the society in which he lives. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a critique of totalitarian societies, but it's also about Winston Smith and his alienation from the society in which he lives. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World provides a dystopian vision of the world - through the eyes of a man alienated from the society in which he lives. Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar has a female protagonist whose mental illness is partly because of her alienation from a society which has fixed expectations of women. Then there's Joseph Heller's Catch-22 where central character Yossarian is rather alienated. And Franz Kafka's The Trial where… You get the picture. These books have formed a kind of canon of disaffected literature for disaffected teenagers. At the age of 17 and 18, readers are often searching for something with a bit of existential angst. And nothing taps into teenage angst quite like the idea of exceptionalism. The books in "the canon" can provide a feeling of uniqueness - a clandestine understanding of the world that nobody else quite gets. "'I can see through this, and Kafka can, but you can't'," says Guardian literary critic Nicholas Lezard of the feeling. "'Me and Kafka, we're buddies.'" A book like Catch-22 provides a prism for teenage readers, says Prof John Sutherland, an English literature professor at University College London. "It had sort of this ironic view of the adult world, where you're always trapped. [These books are] intellectual breakthrough stuff, a way of breaking out, a rite of passage." As well as looking for echoes of their disaffection, teenagers are also often attempting to look, well, a bit cool. The books are like a badge of honour. An actual badge, in Lezard's case. "I found a badge for sale that just had the word 'Outsider' on it," he says. "I wore that on my school blazer for a bit." The book itself might be placed conspicuously on show, with the titles poking out of school blazer pockets and tops of satchels. "[They're] what you might call 'accessory books'," says Sutherland. "The book was, as it were, to make a statement. It was particularly pronounced in 1960s, 70s and 80s adolescence. People used to sit around in coffee shops holding a copy of whatever the latest Samuel Beckett was and probably couldn't answer how many Ts there are in Beckett." Any teenager seen reading the book on public transport is sending out a message. "You know that if you sit on the Tube reading that [type of book], people will know you're an angst-ridden teenager," says historian Lisa Jardine, who has researched the reading preferences of men and women. Some may even detect a note of pretentiousness although most teenagers stop short of sporting a beret and pipe and disdainfully peering over a French-language copy of L'Etranger [The Outsider]. But calling the majority of teenagers pretentious is too harsh, says Jardine. "I don't like that word. I would call it 'statement reading'," she says. "They're exploring them, and they're struggling with them, and therefore it's more about statement than showing off. You swap [the fact] that you've read these books and then you know you've got a kindred spirit." Even if there is some posturing, it's not unhealthy, says Lezard, as it's partly about raising your game into adulthood - and some of the ideas do filter in. "So I don't regret any of this," he says. "Perhaps the badge." But the canon of teenage angst books is not the same for both sexes. "There's an absolutely dramatic difference between what girls and boys read at puberty," says Jardine. "Boys read angst books, so they read Catcher in the Rye, L'Etranger and books like that. Girls read expanding emotion and sensibility books. Jane Eyre, [Dodie Smith's] I Capture the Castle, the Brontes… books about difficult relationships. "It was absolutely staggering how little teenage angst books came up on the women's list." Men also tend to cling on to their teenage favourites later into life more than women, Jardine's research showed. But does the canon stay the same? And is there always a group of angsty teenagers to read it? "Nineteen Eighty-Four makes you re-evaluate society," says 17-year-old Enosh Ghimire, from Ealing, west London. "It's a common theme in many of the books - criticising society or evaluating what society is." The canon itself isn't stable. New books may be added, others fall by the wayside. A good movie adaptation can be an obstacle. Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - those reaching adolescence after these films came out had to be extra committed to read the books after watching them - or disciplined enough to read them first. Ghimire says he and many of his friends enjoy reading Game of Thrones and that many are reading the Hunger Games, both of which have popular TV or movie franchises to accompany them. Laura Hampson, 18, from Liverpool, says her friends don't read that much but "they've read The Perks of Being a Wallfower recently because of the film". Hampson is a fan of contemporary John Green titles Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. But she says her favourite book is David Nicholls's popular book One Day, pointing to its unusual time structure and relatable characters. "It didn't make out either character was without fault," she adds. "With some romance books the other character can sometimes be described as this perfect person, which most people can't relate to." Another obstacle to the cultish or cool feel of books in the canon is the way many of them have been absorbed into English literature syllabuses on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 30 years. Ghimire studies both Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four as part of his course, admitting that they're not books he'd normally read. "School opens [them] up," he says. "I wouldn't have known about Brave New World if it wasn't for school. School made me aware that there are other books outside of what I would normally read." But news and current affairs makes some of the books resonate further, he says, citing the Edward Snowden spying affair as making Nineteen Eighty-Four really click. "And Brave New World is going to be relevant for a long time because of technological advances," Ghimire says. And it's only with a sense of irony, or perhaps disappointment, that teenagers realise their mum's favourite book was also Nineteen Eighty-Four and their dad's was Catch-22. "The feeling of being awkward and unhappy at school is in fact perennial," says Sutherland. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, says that a strand in the home schooling movement developed in the 1970s when some Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <title>Housing association helps tenants to read</title>
      <description>The housing association that also teaches literacy</description>

      <body>A few months ago, Christopher had to ask a neighbour or a friend to read him details of a personal hospital appointment or a letter about his rent. Now he can do it himself. In and out of care homes all his life, Christopher left school at 13, without being able to read and write properly. But his life changed when he saw an advert in the local community centre about the Eastlands Homes Literacy Beacons Project in Manchester. After six weeks of one-to-one tuition with a mentor, he was beginning to make sense of the words around him. "I can pick up my mail and look at it, I can pick up books. Before I'd get a brown letter and I'd have to ask a friend or a partner to help," he says. "It's like being proper independent. I don't have to knock on someone else's door. It's given me more independence and I'm proud of it like, I really am." The Literacy Beacon Project was set up 18 months ago by the not-for-profit housing association Eastlands Homes for its tenants and others in the area. Eastlands has 8,000 properties across east and south-east Manchester and many of these are in some of the most deprived wards in the country. So far more than 40 people have completed the course. The idea is simple - adults who struggle to read and write are matched with a volunteer "champion" or mentor who, after some training, meets with them regularly on a one-to-one basis over a six-week period. The scheme started when front-line staff realised many tenants were struggling to read correspondence from them, using excuses like they had not received the letter or had lost their glasses. Neighbourhood services manager Danny O'Sullivan says: "We knew a lot of our tenants had literacy problems. "From a business point of view, it does us a good turn because they can read our letters and so on, but the drive behind the scheme was to help people in the community. "We want to improve people's lives, we are a community project as well as a housing association." Danny says a lot of people who believe they cannot read or write actually do have some basic literacy skills, but have such low confidence they have convinced themselves they are illiterate. He says: "If something frustrates us, we tend not to do it. Take technology - you'd rather ask the kids. You can do it, but the frustration stops you. "The issue is the negative stereotype in your head, 'I can't read, I don't need to read, I'm not going to read.'" Amanda approached the Literacy Beacons Project because she was struggling to fill out contact sheets in her role as a volunteer mentor for offenders recently released from prison. "I was always behind with the sheets, but I couldn't get anyone else to do it because it's confidential information. Now I've got the confidence to pick up a pen. "I think it's because of the one-to-one support, they made me feel dead confident. I had no confidence to pick up a pen. "But here it's the best thing because it's a one-to-one. If I'm in a classroom I get all nervous and worried I'm going to be called thick, because that's what I've had in my life. It's all about my confidence, my champion gives me loads of encouragement. "It's amazing, I've got someone saying I'm good and that makes me feel better about myself. It's made me feel really confident in my reading and writing. "I can go for a job now, I've got the confidence to go for that job and go to the interview." But it's not just the tenants who have benefited from the scheme. Eastlands has found that those who volunteer as champions have reaped huge rewards. Paul, a champion who has helped four people develop their reading, says: "I retired a few years ago and I get so much reward out of this - I never got the buzz that I get out of this. It's time-consuming but it's lovely to do. "As much as they're learning, we're learning from them because we're understanding their issues. All my working life I've never enjoyed anything like this." Sam, who has mentored five tenants, adds: "It's so rewarding to see what you've achieved for somebody. "It's better as well because we're not teachers and we don't spell everything right. They feel at ease with one person and they don't have to feel that someone's ahead of them." Sam was particularly touched by the case of one elderly lady who had been constrained by literacy problems all her life. "I had a 75-year-old lady and only her husband knew she had trouble with reading and writing," she says. "When he passed away, she was on her own. She was buying the same things in the supermarket because that was what she recognised. But now she can read the labels - she has the choice." Champions are not just community volunteers - staff working for the housing association are also encouraged to mentor those who sign up for the project. Eastlands communications manager Abi Mistry says: "I had a woman with three kids and she'd never been able to leave her children little notes. When she finally wrote a letter to her eight-year-old son, she cried - and I cried, it was so emotional. "She had left school with no qualifications, had her first child at 17 and couldn't help them with their homework. To see her confidence grow was amazing." The housing association is now so confident with the scheme, it hopes to take it to other areas of need, such as prisons and rehabilitation centres. Danny O'Sullivan says: "We're in talks with the National Literacy Trust. We're trying to grow it, to get it elsewhere. It's a great system and we hope it'll go out further. "I'd like to see a lot of other organisations doing it and not just housing associations. It would be brilliant in prisons, in probation offices, drug rehabilitation centres, community charities, anywhere that socially deprived people are accessing. "We understand it well enough now to take it to other places." Amanda wants to see the project benefit other people like her. She says: "I just think it should be rolled out everywhere because there are people out there, especially older people, who would be too scared to say, 'I can't read or write.'" In the meantime, the literacy project has been shortlisted in the Business in the Community category at the Manchester Be Proud Awards. </body>

      <title>Can US universities learn from India?</title>
      <description>Should the US learn from India's technology students</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24743439</url>

      <body>By the year 2020 the US is expected to have 1.4 million computing-related jobs, but will only have the capacity to fill a third of them. Should schools in the United States be looking to Asia for tips on how to get more students to study science and maths? From a young age, children at India's top schools have it drilled into them that they must excel in maths and science. Their goal is to win a coveted place at one of the 16 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and a fast track to a high-flying job. The IITs enjoy no international ranking but they have been recognised by the US Congress and Microsoft founder Bill Gates for their contribution to US innovation. Graduates have gone on to be leading high-tech innovators - for example the creator of Google news Krishna Bharat, and the co-founders of online poker site PartyGaming studied at the IITs. Each year about one million Indian students sit the entrance exam hoping for this kind of success, but just 10,000 people, or 1% of them make it. There are nine times more people applying for each place than there are applying to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the highest-ranking universities in the world. One student who made the grade is 21 year old Utkarsh Malhotra. He is now in his final year but says passing the entrance exam was like scaling an academic Mount Everest. "I know people who changed their diets, who changed their sleeping patterns, who changed everything for this examination," he says. "IITs are like a pressure cooker situation so I don't know if this prepares us for future life well or not." Eighteen year-old Twinkle Aurora is hoping to follow in Malhotra's footsteps. She attends a private coaching institute and spends 13 hours a day, six days a week studying to pass the exam. "It's very tough because you can't stay in touch with social media like Facebook and WhatsApp - they take a lot of your time, so you have to sacrifice lots of friendships… but after one year when you've slogged your way through the year you get something that's big," she says. But once the students are in, the pressure remains. I met Malhotra on a Friday afternoon but instead of winding down for the weekend, he was working hard. "I don't know [if any other] institutes in India have exams on a weekend but this one does. The pressure is immense and you grow to live with it," he says. So what makes the IITs so successful? "We get the best students in the country," says Suneet Tuli, the dean of research and development at the Delhi campus. "And for a country of 1.2 billion, the best is really the best." "The second thing - this is part of our culture, [education is] based a lot on mathematics, so that gives them good analytical skills." Some think the US could learn from the way India approaches science and maths, including Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google. She thinks there should be much more emphasis on computer science in US schools. "Nine out of 10 schools right now are not teaching computer science. If you think about the future and you think about how important computer science is going to be it's a problem - we're going to need a lot more kids to be able to have those skills," she says. "I would really like it to be like reading and math and science and spelling - they are requirements - everybody takes it, everybody learns it, and that's the way I think we need to think about computer science and coding in the future." There has been some criticism of the methods the Indian education system uses with its reliance on rote learning, and whether this really prepares the IIT students for the wider world. Steve Stepanian, head of Indian operations for the management consultancy Bain and Company, has some reservations. "At the more junior levels they are very quantitatively sound, they are very responsible, no problem. The issue becomes [when] they're given an open-ended question - that is where there seems to be more of a struggle," he says. For example, they would get the basic figures spot on, but when he asks what advice they would give to a chief executive - "that is where you draw a real blank," he says. In his experience, the number crunching by US students may not be as accurate, but "when I come to that question of what the CEO should do, they are much more capable of synthesising that and pulling together a much more cohesive answer and make a recommendation". But for Wojcicki it is about the balance between learning the basics and thinking creatively: "I look at Silicon Valley and we have so many great engineers that have come from India," she says. "American schools are really good [when it comes to] thinking about the creative component but we also need kids to learn the basics."

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063</url>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy, the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentle man". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>Europe at 'polio risk' from Syria</title>
      <description>The outbreak of polio in Syria could lead to the disease re-emerging in Europe according to an article in the Lancet journal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24854920</url>

      <body>Europe could be at risk from polio following a recent outbreak in Syria, infectious disease experts say. In the Lancet journal, two doctors in Germany say the cases in Syria - which had been free of wild poliovirus since 1999 - could endanger nearby regions. They say because only one in 200 people infected develops paralysis it could take a year of "silent transmission" before an outbreak is detected. In that time hundreds of individuals could be carrying the infection. Prof Martin Eichner, of the University of Tubingen and Stefan Brockmann, of Reutlingen Regional Public Health Office explain that most European countries use inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) rather than the live oral polio vaccine (OPV), because the latter can, in rare cases, lead to cases of acute flaccid paralysis, the main symptom of polio. Whilst IPV is highly effective at preventing polio disease, it does not give the same level of protection against the virus as the oral drops, so vaccination coverage needs to be very high. The doctors say that countries with low coverage such as Austria (83%) and Ukraine (74%) risk a sustained outbreak should the virus be introduced via refugees fleeing Syria. Polio vaccine coverage in the UK is at 95%. The doctors said Israel could also pose a potential polio threat. Prof Eichner told me: "Wild poliovirus has also been found in sewage in Israel and from samples taken from some symptom-free individuals since February 2013. Although there have been no cases of polio in Israel, tourists could risk bringing the infection to other countries." Dr Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: "The Syrian outbreak puts Europe at risk because of the way we give vaccines. In parts of the world where it is still possible to catch a wild strain of poliovirus, children are usually vaccinated with a live but genetically weakened poliovirus which gives excellent protection but has a tiny risk of changing back to the more dangerous form. "However, in parts of the world where polio has been eradicated, like the UK, children are usually given a killed vaccine. It doesn't protect quite as well but it cannot mutate, so it protects reasonably well while preventing polio from being accidentally reintroduced to a country. He added: "Vaccination is never perfect, so despite being vaccinated, a small percentage of children in the UK would be at risk of contracting polio if they were exposed to the virus. Until the virus is completely extinct, it is essential that we continue to vaccinate our children." The Department of Health Director of Immunisation, Professor David Salisbury said: "The UK is well defended against the possibility of importation of polio from outbreaks such as the present one in Syria. Our population has very high coverage of polio vaccination with more than 95% of young children being vaccinated. We have WHO-approved surveillance in place so we can pick up polio if it does start to circulate in the UK." Most of the 22 cases of polio-like paralysis in Syria (10 of which have been confirmed as wild poliovirus type) are among children below the age of two who were unimmunised or who had not received all three doses of vaccine. The World Health Organization warned last month there was a high risk of polio spreading internationally because of the movement of refugees across the region and low immunisation rates in Syria. Prof Eichner said: "The WHO wants to get rid of polio completely and had got pretty close until recent outbreaks. The fact that most of those infected do not display symptoms but can still spread the disease makes it a very hard virus to get rid of as it is like fighting an invisible enemy." So far this year 322 cases of wild poliovirus have been confirmed, more than half of them in Somalia. </body>

      <title>Measles cases double in two weeks</title>

      <body>The number of cases of measles in an outbreak in Neath and Swansea has more than doubled in the last two weeks. Public Health Wales (PHW) renewed its call for parents to urgently get their children vaccinated to stop the disease spreading. PHW said it was "very frustrated" with cases reaching 36 since early October. The latest outbreak comes less than four months after Wales' biggest measles outbreak ended - centred on the same area with 1,200 suspected cases. The outbreak has affected four schools in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board (ABM) area. "Parents and young people should not underestimate how serious measles can be and how quickly it can spread," said Dr Jorg Hoffmann, consultant in communicable disease control for PHW. "In a school setting, one child with measles sitting in a classroom for just one hour will lead to at least 70 per cent of other pupils who are not vaccinated catching measles. "To prevent this outbreak from spreading even further, it's crucial that unvaccinated children and young people receive two doses of MMR urgently and that those with symptoms do not attend school." PHW is working closely with ABM to bring the outbreak under control and where a sufficient number of children are unvaccinated in a school where there has been measles cases, school vaccination sessions will be arranged. The Swansea area epidemic lasted eight months with suspected cases first reported in November 2012. By the time the outbreak was declared over in July, it had resulted in 1,219 notifications of measles cases in the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg, Hywel Dda and Powys health board areas. Some 88 people visited a hospital due to measles during the outbreak and more than 75,000 were vaccinated throughout Wales. Gareth Colfer-Williams, 25, from Swansea, died from pneumonia after contracting the virus at the height of the epidemic. The symptoms of measles include a fever, fatigue, runny nose, conjunctivitis and a distinctive red rash. Although more than 70,000 catch up doses of MMR were given across Wales during the outbreak, around 30,000 children and young people in the 10 to 18 age group remain unprotected. Dr Hoffmann added: "Parents who have decided not to vaccinate their children are not only risking their children's health, but are putting other children at risk, children either too young to be vaccinated or with medical conditions that prevent them from being vaccinated. "We are very frustrated to see more cases of measles in the area so soon after the large outbreak earlier this year and we are very keen for this to be stopped before it can get any bigger and we return to a position where children are admitted to hospital or die or are damaged by the disease. "The only way to achieve that is through vaccination and I urge parents whose children have not received two doses of MMR to ensure that they speak to their GP immediately to arrange this quick, safe and effective vaccine." </body>

      <title>A&amp;E staff pressures 'unsustainable'</title>
      <description>An independent report into the Accident and Emergency departments at the Royal Victoria and Mater Hospitals says the "overwhelming" pressures experienced by staff are not sustainable.</description>

      <body>The pressures faced by accident and emergency staff at Belfast's Royal Victoria and Mater Hospitals are unsustainable, an independent report has suggested. It follows an inspection carried out by the College of Emergency Medicine which has been leaked to the BBC. The report said issues faced by medics in the Belfast Trust are probably worse than anywhere else in the UK. The trust said it welcomed the report and an action plan was in place. The author of the report, Dr Taj Hassan, said: "We were concerned because staff were working under some intolerable pressures at times. "They are understaffed, both within the broader workforce and the consultant numbers, for a service like that. "It reflected underfunding, probably over a number of years, and has now culminated in the present pressures. "Staff will always work hard to try and maintain a safe system, what gets compromised unfortunately is certain aspects of quality. Those staff are working far far too hard and that's not sustainable." The inspection, carried out in March, found that pressures on staff were at times "overwhelming , leading to poor clinical care and safety concerns". Inspectors point to the closure of the AandE unit at Belfast City Hospital as a contributing factor, with a 30% increase in footfall. The report was delayed to allow further work to improve performance, however, despite good work it says the system remains under significant stress. The inspectors describe the challenges as serious and say that they must be urgently addressed. The report says that safety needs to be embedded into the culture of the organisation and that senior managers need to show that change is occurring. Among its 10 recommendations are a dedicated emergency care team to deliver change and a review of the number of emergency consultants. It also says that the flow of patients and bed management planning should be regarded as a priority for further development by the trust. Janice Smith, from the Royal College of Nursing, said she was concerned that the pressures were leading to decisions being made that were not in the best interest of patients. She said the report "lends weight to issues that have been raised about that department." "I don't think it's an overstatement - it would certainly resonate with some of the nurses who work there," she added. Joe McCusker, from health union Unison, said he was not surprised by the content of the report. "We go from crisis to crisis, yet nothing is ever done about it," he said. The chair of the assembly's health committee, Sinn Fein's Maeve McLaughlin, said the committee had to hold the health minister and department to account. "As a committee we need to ensure that first off, the recommendations are listened to, and secondly are acted on," she said. While the Belfast Health Trust might argue that some of these concerns have already been addressed, it is not the first time they have been raised by either inspectors or in fact, by members of the public. The emergency department has been in the spotlight repeatedly over the past two years. While waiting times have significantly improved - the real test will be the approaching winter when the environment and the staff are expected to be under severe pressure. This is not just a local problem. Emergency medicine is under severe pressure across the UK. While the number of elderly people is increasing, those who work at the coal face say that fact has not been matched by more money. </body>

      <title>US moves to ban trans fats in foods</title>
      <description>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to Americans' health.</description>

      <body>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to health. Trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils, are no longer "generally recognised as safe", said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulator said a ban could prevent 7,000 deaths and 20,000 heart attacks in the US each year. The FDA is opening a 60-day consultation period on the plan, which would gradually phase out trans fats. "While consumption of potentially harmful artificial trans fat has declined over the last two decades in the United States, current intake remains a significant public health concern," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a statement. "The FDA's action today is an important step toward protecting more Americans from the potential dangers of trans fat." If the agency's plan is successful, the heart-clogging oils would be considered food additives and could not be used in food unless officially approved. The ruling does not affect foods with naturally occurring trans fats, which are present in small amounts in certain meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats are used both in processed food and in restaurants as a way to improve the shelf life or flavour of foods. The fats are created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil, making it a solid. Nutritionists have long criticised their use, saying they contribute to heart disease more than saturated fat. Some companies have already phased out trans fats, prompted by new nutritional labels introduced in 2006 requiring it to be listed on food packaging. New York City and some other local governments have also banned it. But trans fats persist primarily in processed foods - including some microwave popcorns and frozen pizzas - and in restaurants that use the oils for frying. According to the FDA, trans fat intake among Americans declined from 4.6g per day in 2003 to around 1g per day in 2012. The American Heart Association said the FDA's proposal was a step forward in the battle against heart disease. "We commend the FDA for responding to the numerous concerns and evidence submitted over the years about the dangers of this industrially produced ingredient," said its chief executive, Nancy Brown. Outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the charge to ban trans fats in that city, said the FDA plan "deserves great credit". "The groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in New York City have become a model for the nation for one reason: they've worked," he said. </body>

      <title>City hospital in Savile allegation</title>
      <description>An allegation against Jimmy Savile relating to a Cardiff hospital has been investigated, health officials say.</description>

      <body>Health officials have investigated an allegation against Jimmy Savile relating to Cardiff Royal Infirmary. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said an adult reported an incident from the early 1960s and it was working with police on the matter. The hospital is one of 13 under investigation in the UK following revelations about decades of abuse carried out by the former Radio 1 DJ. Final reports on the investigations are due in June 2014. The disclosure that Cardiff Royal Infirmary was involved in the inquiry was made in a written Parliamentary answer by health minister Norman Lamb. In a statement on Thursday night, the health board said: "Cardiff and Vale University Health Board can confirm that it has investigated one allegation from an adult relating to an alleged incident at Cardiff Royal Infirmary in the early 1960s. "The health board is working closely with South Wales Police and the Department of Health on the matter and is not in a position to comment further at this time." The question in Parliament had been tabled by former children's minister Tim Loughton MP. In his answer, Mr Lamb revealed there were 13 hospitals being investigated. Many of them had previously been identified, but this was the first time that a hospital in Wales had been named as being part of the inquiry. An investigation has also been commissioned by the Sue Ryder charity in relation to Wheatfields Hospice in Leeds. In October UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation reports are thorough and complete, and reflect all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending. "The final reports of all the investigations will now aim to be completed by June 2014, with publication sooner if that is possible." Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is believed to have abused hundreds of victims during his 50-year career as a radio and TV personality. The Metropolitan Police launched a formal criminal investigation into Savile's alleged offences on 19 October 2012, called Operation Yewtree. In January, police and the NSPCC published a joint report - Giving Victims a Voice - on Savile's sexual offending. Key points included that the earliest recorded Savile offence was in 1955, with the most recent in 2009. His offending was most frequent during the period 1966-1976 when he was between 40 and 50 years old. Reports of offences at the BBC spanned more than 40 years, from 1965 to 2006. It said Savile's youngest victim was an eight-year-old boy. The oldest was 47, while most were aged 13-16. The report said 73% of his victims were under 18 and 82% were female. Offences were said to be mainly opportunistic sexual assaults, but there were others where an element of grooming or planning was said to have occurred. Victims' recorded crimes including 126 indecent acts and 34 rapes or similar offences. Cardiff Royal Infirmary opened in 1884 and closed as a district general hospital in 1999 but has since been used as a base for community health services. It is currently undergoing a £30m revamp. </body>

      <title>Autism detectable 'in first months'</title>
      <description>Signs of autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>An early indication of autism can be identified in babies under six months old, a study suggests. US researchers, writing in Nature, analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism initially developed normally but showed diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - between two and six months of age. A UK expert said the findings raise hope for early interventions. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the life-long condition, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

      <title>Prosthetic bladder 'controls urine'</title>
      <description>A device that could one day restore bladder function to patients with a severed spinal cord has been devised by UK researchers.</description>

      <body>A device that could one day restore bladder function to patients with a severed spinal cord has been devised by UK researchers and tested in animals. Nerve damage can leave no sense of when the bladder is full or control over when the contents are released. A study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed a device to read the remaining nerves' signals could be used to control the organ. The charity Spinal Research said this was "impressive and important" work. The loss of bladder, bowel and sexual function after spinal cord injury is often rated by patients as having the biggest impact on quality of life. When the spinal cord is injured, signals passing up from the bladder cannot tell the brain when the bladder is full. Going the other way, signals from the brain cannot tell the bladder when it is time to go to the toilet. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have devised a solution that uses the nerves still around the bladder. Electrodes wrapped around bundles of nerves can interpret signals that say the bladder is full. Stimulating other sets of nerves can get the bladder to contract on demand and prevent it emptying of its own volition. One of the researchers, Dr Daniel Chew, told the BBC the device had worked on rats. "It is very effective. The feasibility studies are done, we're now limited by miniaturisation of the technology," he said. While the components that fit inside a rat could be converted for human use, the rest of the technology to process the information recorded currently needs a 6ft (2m) stack of equipment. This needs to shrunk down to a handheld device that can inform a patient when the bladder is full and a trigger button to contract the bladder. Dr Chew added: "This device is not the ultimate goal, the ultimate aim is to regenerate the spinal cord. What we're doing is restoring some function, not curing spinal cord injury." Dr Mark Bacon, the director of research at the charity Spinal Research, told the BBC: "Bladder dysfunction blights the life of many with spinal cord injuries and has a very major impact on their health and quality of life. "This is impressive and important work addressing one of the major limitations found with existing options for electrical stimulation to control bladder emptying, namely the need to surgically destroy the sensory fibres coming from the bladder. "Sparing and making use of sensory signals from a filling bladder adds a welcome degree of sophistication to elective voiding whilst retaining other functions normally lost such as erectile function - a distressing consequence of current methods." </body>

      <title>Car deaths 'down 40% in 50 years'</title>
      <description>The annual figures for people dying in car crashes in England and Wales have fallen by 40% in the past 50 years.</description>

      <body>The annual figures for people dying in car crashes in England and Wales have fallen by 40% in the past 50 years. A paper in the Emergency Medicine Journal says this is despite the rise in the number of drivers on the road. Men were more likely die than women in each year studied. Safety experts said measures including seat belts, speed cameras and curbs on drink driving had all helped cut deaths. About 1.3 million people die globally in crashes every year. Current trends suggest road accidents are expected to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. In this study, a team from the University of Nottingham looked at data on road deaths from the Office of National Statistics from 1960 to 2009. During that period, 102,196 people died as a direct result of a road traffic accident. In 1960, car crashes caused 1,647 deaths, but by 2009 the figure had fallen to 964 - a drop of 41%. Over that time, car ownership across the UK increased by about 3% every year. Men were more likely to die than women in every year studied. And those who from socially deprived backgrounds were consistently more likely to die in a car crash than those who were more affluent. There was a 70% fall in deaths among infants and children, from 66 in 1960 to 20 in 2009. Fatalities among the over-75s did rise - from 68 to 109 - but the researchers say this should be seen in the context of the increase in the number of drivers in this age group. Writing in the journal the researchers, led by Dr Andrew Fogarty, said factors such as the introduction of compulsory seat belts, drink driving curbs, child safety seats, and speed cameras, as well as the development of specialist trauma centres, had all helped to cut deaths. They added: "However, it is possible that while these interventions have resulted in a reduction in the absolute number of deaths from [road traffic accidents] in England and Wales, they have not modified the relative differential in age of death between sexes or socioeconomic groups in those who die after [a car crash]." Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: "The reductions in road deaths over the last five years or so have been particularly substantial, although this is partly due to the effects the economic downturn and periods of unusually poor weather on the level of driving. "However, as the BMJ report identifies, not everyone has benefited equally from these improvements in road safety, and people from less well off backgrounds suffer a disproportionate share of the risk. "The social factors that create this increased risk need to be tackled in a systematic way by organisations responsible for road safety. "Common approaches to improving the health, wellbeing and the safety of individuals and communities need to be identified, and closer ties and partnership working between road safety and health professionals should be developed at all levels of work." He added: "We also need to focus on specific groups of road users who face higher risks, especially cyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists and young, novice drivers." </body>

      <body>Concerns about a "bullying culture" at a hospital now under police investigation were raised more than a year ago, it is claimed. The Care Quality Commission has found "inaccuracies" in the cancer waiting time data at Colchester Hospital. The Royal College of Nursing says the hospital dismissed its concerns raised more than a year ago as "fantasy". The hospital said an investigation carried out by its own management in February 2012 was "not adequate". Staff told inspectors they were "pressured or bullied" to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said. The inspector said patients' lives may have been put at risk. Essex Police has been sent information by the CQC and is currently investigating whether there are grounds for a formal criminal investigation. Karen Webb, the regional director for the eastern region at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said she raised concerns a year ago about the "bullying culture, the secrecy of the management culture" at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust. She said RCN members who voiced these concerns were dismissed as "fantasists" and the board of the hospital tried to bully them into "shutting up". "I think there are a few things that smell rather unpleasant about Colchester General and the way that it is being led," Ms Webb said. "It is a great shame the trust chose not to listen to us over a year ago. Not only has it not acted on it, it behaved in the way that bullies classically behave. "Regularly, staff at Colchester Hospital have been told to keep quiet, to shut up, to not say anything about the directions that they've been given by senior managers to make sure that the hospital meets its target by massaging the data." Responding to her claims, Dr Gordon Coutts, the hospital's chief executive since July 2010, said there had been an investigation into the allegations in 2012 carried out by two members of the management team. This probe, he said, "was not adequate" and "did not go deep enough". Asked by BBC Essex if he would resign, Dr Coutts said: "My job is to keep improving this hospital, and I intend to continue to do so." Tim Roberts, the regional co-ordinator of Unison, said it first raised concerns last year. "Our members said they were being bullied, they were under undue pressure by middle and senior managers to falsify records, to put erroneous data on the cancer pathway database," he said. "The dates when a patient was referred to hospital - they were asked to change the dates. "The result was the trust would look like it kept to the cancer pathway deadline set by the Department of Health. "There's a high likelihood patients received treatment later because the wrong date was put on the database." Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell said he was "appalled" at the findings that showed staff falsified patient data. Sir Bob said what has happened "cannot be justified under any circumstances". "What level was this knowledge known? Senior people will have to answer for what they knew," said Sir Bob. "The consequences may well be that some people in senior positions may go or be asked to go." NHS England said it would now lead an incident management team of cancer specialists, to ensure the safety of cancer patients at the hospital. There will also be a review looking back to as far as 2010 to check whether any other patients had their notes changed or "inappropriately recorded". Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, recommended Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust be put into special measures, which could lead to a new management team being installed or another trust put in charge. The hospital has set up a helpline for any patients or families who have concerns - 0800 028 2026. </body>

      <title>NHS deal on branded-medicine cost</title>
      <description>The government and pharmaceutical companies agree a five-year-deal to fix NHS spending on branded medicines.</description>

      <body>The government and pharmaceutical companies have agreed a five-year-deal to fix NHS spending on branded medicines across the UK. Last year, the NHS spent more than £12bn on branded drugs. Under the deal, NHS spending will remain flat for two years, followed by increases of less than 2% in the following three years. But the industry, which will absorb any costs above that limit, said it was a "tough deal" built on "myth". The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) is a voluntary scheme usually re-negotiated every five years This scheme applies to all licensed prescription medicines to which the manufacturer has applied a brand name. There had previously been an agreed price cut on the branded medicines sold to the NHS, but there was no limit on the overall cost. Typical annual growth in NHS spending has been about 5%. The new arrangements will be introduced from January 1 2014. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "This agreement ensures NHS patients will receive the best and most advanced medicines in the world while managing the cost." But Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: "Whilst the deal allows us to move forward and focus on the key issue of ensuring NHS patients get access to the medicines they need, the government needs to recognise that medicines are an investment in patient care and not just a cost to be managed." ABPI president Deepak Khana added: "It should not be underestimated how tough this deal is for the industry. "The negotiations were built on a myth that medicines are expensive in the UK, which is not true. "The UK already spends amongst the lowest on medicines as a percentage of [gross domestic product] and has some of the lowest prices in Europe, yet UK patients still do not always get access to the most innovative medicines." </body>

      <body>Women's lung muscles have to work harder than men's, making breathlessness more common after exercise, say scientists in Canada. Their study in the journal Experimental Physiology examined the activity of the diaphragm - the muscle that drives lung function. It had to work harder in women to compensate for smaller lungs, the research showed. The research was conducted at McGill University. Even with a man and a woman of equal size, the woman's lungs are smaller and their airways narrower. Breathlessness can occur after tough physical exercise or be a symptom of some illnesses such as bronchitis. "In both health and diseases, women are more likely to show signs of breathlessness after physical activity than men," said lead researcher Dr Dennis Jensen. The study compared 25 men and 25 women between the ages of 20 and 40, exercising on a bicycle. How deep and how fast they breathed at different levels of exercise were recorded. They also recorded the "drive to breathe", the electrical signals sent to the diaphragm to control its movement. Dr Jensen told the BBC: "Women have biologically smaller lungs and they have to activate respiratory muscles more to move a given amount of air." He said it was an "important insight into why women with emphysema and heart failure have worse breathing symptoms than men". Further studies will investigate the impact of obesity on breathlessness. </body>

      <title>Males more likely to be 'fat and 40'</title>
      <description>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests.</description>

      <body>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests. A study found more than two-thirds of men and around half of women in their early 40s were overweight or obese. However, the men were much less likely to realise they were carrying excess weight, say researchers at the University of London. The findings come from a study following 10,000 UK men and women born during one week in 1970. Those born in 1970 were considerably more likely to be overweight or obese in their early 40s than those born 12 years earlier, the researchers found. Men were far more likely than women to carry excess weight - with 45% classed as overweight and a further 23% obese compared with 29% and 20% of women. However, men were also much less likely than women to recognise they were overweight and attempt to slim down. Dr Alice Sullivan, of the Institute of Education at the University of London, told BBC News: "It's become so normalised for men to be overweight and they don't realise it - they're much less likely than women to realise their weight is unhealthy. "The worrying thing is that if men are overweight they are much less likely to take on health messages." Dr Sullivan and colleague Dr Matt Brown say carrying excess weight is seen as more socially acceptable for men than women. Overweight men are thus less likely to see this as a health problem and do something about it. Alerting men to their body mass index (BMI) status and the associated health risks should be a priority, they say. Commenting on the study, Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. "Worryingly, this research highlights that men seem more inclined to ignore their expanding waistlines than women. "Whether you're a man or a woman, maintaining a healthy, balanced diet and keeping physically active can help you reduce your weight and your risk of cardiovascular disease. "For advice and support on how to do this speak to your GP or practice nurse." The research studied the BMI of almost 10,000 men and women in their early 40s being followed by the 1970 British Cohort Study, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). </body>

      <title>'24-hour' complaint process needed</title>

      <body>Patients, carers and relatives should be able to raise concerns over NHS care 24 hours a day, suggests Health Ombudsman Julie Mellor. In this week's Scrubbing Up - she explains how she hopes the Clwyd-Hart Review of hospital complaints will help tackle the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance by patients to complain and defensiveness of NHS organisations when addressing complaints and concerns. Too often we hear of patients not having the confidence to raise a concern on a hospital ward. They fear they won't be listened to or taken seriously. Even if they do complain, they can find NHS organisations defensive rather than open to feedback. One of the many people who we've spoken to about complaining said: "I feel like the little man against the system". We know this is an issue from the ward to the hospital board. The Ombudsman report 'NHS governance of complaints handling' found that only a fifth of NHS boards review learning from complaints and subsequently take action to improve services. People come to us once they've exhausted the local NHS complaints process. Our new approach from April this year means we have already accepted three times more complaints for investigation than we did last year and are sharing more learning from them with the NHS. We want hospitals to change their approach too and to welcome complaints and concerns raised by patients and carers at a local level as opportunities for improvement. We think it is critical that the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance to complain by patients coupled with defensiveness by NHS staff and organisations is tackled as a priority. We need to see a shift to a more open, collaborative and transparent culture within the NHS. This emphasis on local resolution can lead to opportunities to learn and improve services, providing a change in complaints handling from ward to board level. In order to deliver this change, there needs to be a focus on what patients need to help them raise a concern. The research and evidence we submitted to the Clwyd-Hart Review provides a powerful picture of what good complaint handling looks like. For patients and carers, advice on how to raise a concern should be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that every patient, carer and relative would have the opportunity to raise an issue in person, by email or over the phone. They would also receive support in doing so through local advocacy services. We have suggested the creation of one easily identifiable brand for this which could be used by all advocacy services in every local authority in England. For hospitals, boards should take the lead in bringing about a change in culture from defensiveness to one that welcomes and encourages feedback, where they use information from complaints to put things right. And commissioners and regulators need to hold NHS organisations to account with regard to listening to concerns and using information from them to improve services. Improving complaints handling will ensure that the same mistakes in patient care do not happen time and time again. It will also help to better the public's confidence in the NHS. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <description>How a simple measurement saves lives</description>

      <body>Each year, one in 10 babies around the world will be born prematurely and over a million of those will die. But could measuring the size of a baby's feet help save lives? In the final weeks of pregnancy, the idea of going into early labour might not seem like such a bad thing. But giving birth prematurely - officially classed as before 37 weeks gestation - can lead to long-term health effects. Depending on quite how early the baby is born, infants can either be completely unaffected or left with permanent disability and learning difficulties. The issue of prematurity is particularly pronounced in South Asian and Sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for over 80% of the deaths caused by pre-term birth complications. In rural Tanzania, for example, about one in every 30 premature babies won't make it past four weeks. However, most of those lives could be saved with simple advice for mothers. And that advice, says an international group of researchers, could start with just a footprint. Most mothers in high-income countries will give birth surrounded by medical equipment or with the support of a highly-skilled midwife. This means that any problems, such as a low birth-weight or the mother's waters breaking early, can be dealt with immediately. In contrast, around 40% of women giving birth in low-income countries will do so without the help of a trained medical professional. And due to inaccurate dating of pregnancy, many of those women will have no way of telling if their baby is too early or too small. However, measuring the baby's footprint could be used as a simple proxy for birth weight. "There's this grey area when the baby is between around 2.4kg (5lbs 5oz) and 2.1kg (4lbs 10oz) when the baby is more vulnerable to infection and other issues," says Dr Joanna Schellenberg of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "But when a baby is born at home, there is no way of weighing them," she told the BBC. To help solve the problem, Schellenberg and her colleagues at the Ifakara Health Institute in Tanzania have implemented a strategy called Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga - which means "protect the newborn baby". It includes using a picture of two footprints on a piece of laminated card and a local volunteer placing the baby's foot against the images. If the baby has feet smaller than the smallest foot, around 67mm, then the mother is advised to take the baby to hospital immediately. If it measures in between the big and the small image, then the mother is told about the extra care she needs to provide to increase the baby's chances of survival. Although the card is fairly accurate for five days after birth, it should be used it to identify small babies in their first two days of life, which is when they're most at risk of dying without specialist care. Mariam Ulaya is one of the volunteers at Namayakata shuleni village and visits the women before and after the birth. "If I've measured the child's footprint and seen that the child is smaller than usual, then I instruct them to carry the child skin-to-skin so that the child can share and feel the mother's warmth," says Ulaya. "I also carry a small doll with me called Opendo. I use the doll to illustrate the proper way to breastfeed the child." Such advice may seem simple but can really be the difference between life and death. A report by the World Health Organization (WHO) says that of the 15 million premature births globally each year, more than 80% will occur between 32 and 37 weeks' gestation. Most of these babies will survive if given extra warmth through skin-to-skin contact and very regular breastfeeding to help fight off infection. In fact, the report states that an estimated 75% of deaths in preterm infants can be prevented in this way - without the cost and emotional upset of intensive care. Salima Ahmad is 25 and has three children who live with her in Namahyakata dinduma village, Tanzania. Her youngest son, Alhaji, was born prematurely. "I was a little bit shocked because many premature babies end up dying but I was also happy because I had a live baby," says Salima. Although Alhaji was born at the local hospital, Salima was given advice and support by volunteers from Mtunze Mtoto Mchanga about how to care for him once she got home. "Carrying skin-to-skin was good but difficult in the beginning. But when the volunteer was visiting me and encouraging me, I could see myself managing it slowly. It is good, it has helped my child to survive," she says. Salima also feels that understanding more about premature birth helps mothers like herself to deal with it properly. "It helps a lot for the mother not to be surprised when having a premature birth. It is useful to know in advance as you get good knowledge on how to handle the premature. Myself, I do thank the volunteer who talked about it when I was pregnant and she even taught me how to carry skin to skin." The project is still underway and it will take another six months before it's clear whether measuring feet has the ability to save thousands of lives. However, it is already having a positive effect on the way mothers in the area are preparing for childbirth. "When I had my first child, she was small and was not breastfeeding well and I did not know where to get help," says Rukia Twarib, who is currently pregnant with her second child. "Now I have information, if the situation ever happens again, I know can go to the health centre to get help." Advice from volunteers like Miriam also appears to be contributing to the increase in women now choosing to deliver at a health centre rather than at home. Dr Isa Lipupu works at the nearby Nangururwe health centre. "In the last two years, we had about 20 deliveries at the health centre. But this time we have already delivered more than 40 babies. This is about 60-80% of all the mothers that were pregnant," he says. If the strategy proves successful, then there are already plans to roll out the footprint scheme to the rest of Tanzania, giving more health volunteers the ability to quickly spot at-risk babies. "Right now many people are aware of the work I do. All the families have been very welcoming and have accepted me and this programme," says Mariam Ulaya. "I have seen a lot of changes in the area. I can see that there are more mothers visiting the clinic and giving birth there - much more than they used to do - and so I am grateful for that." </body>

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly identified ligament may hold the key to common injuries</description>

      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used macroscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the new ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and its role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <description>Key questions raised by patient record tampering at Colchester General</description>

      <body>Inspectors have found evidence of cancer records at an Essex hospital being tampered with, potentially putting patients at risk. A detailed report listing what was happening has been produced by the Care Quality Commission after inspectors went in at the end of August and start of September. The case has now been passed on to the police to investigate and the trust - Colchester General - faces being put into special measures and further investigations by the authorities in the NHS. In the weeks and months that come there are many questions that need to be answered. Inspectors looked at just over 60 cases and found the care of 22 may have been compromised. All but two of these case were chosen at random. That suggests this practice could have been pretty widespread. NHS England has set up a specialist team to look at the care given to patients since 2010. The hospital sees about 6,000 cancer patients a year, although the tampering with records seems so far to be centred around the specialities that deal with cancers such as kidney, bladder, prostate and colon. Senior management of the trust was alerted to what was happening early last year. An internal review was carried out by two members of the trust's executive team, but it did not result in the practice being stopped. The trust now concedes the investigation was not carried out properly- and has apologised for that. Colchester has yet to release details of that investigation or even said much about how it was carried out. But senior bosses - including the current chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts who has been in post since September 2010 - will have to explain themselves soon. The trust said a review of what went wrong with this investigation will be carried out. Colchester was one of 14 hospital trusts inspected as part of the Keogh Review into centres with high mortality rates. Eleven were subsequently put into special measures, but Colchester was one of three that escaped the sanction. A whistleblower alerted the Keogh team towards the end of the programme abut the tampering with records and this was passed on to the CQC for follow up. Those involved in the Keogh process say there was not sufficient concerns about the leadership of the trust to warrant it being placed in special measures. But the fact such a shocking practice was not dealt with by the Keogh inspection process - which has, after all, formed the basis of the new CQC hospital inspection regime that got under way in September - is a cause for concern. One of the elements of the Stafford Hospital scandal was that there was evidence out there about the poor care that patients were receiving. Patient surveys and complaints all pointed to the fact that something was not right. The problem was that the people with the power to act either ignored the warning signs or missed them. Did the same happen here? It is too early to tell. But what we do know is that the trust had a much higher than expected number of complaints being made against it, according to the CQC. Unions including Unison and the Royal College of Nursing also say they were trying to raise the alarm, but managers dismissed their concerns. Prof Sir Mike Richards, the chief inspector of hospitals, says he has never before heard of anything like this happening anywhere else. But what this case proves is that problems of this nature are very difficult to spot. The CQC inspection team only found evidence of tampering after being told exactly where to look. That raises the prospect that it could be going on undetected elsewhere. However, as the new hospital inspection regime is rolled out - by the end of 2015 all hospital trusts will have been visited - inspectors are bound to be keeping an eye out for this sort of practice. </body>

      <title>Will it be a bleak winter for the NHS?</title>
      <description>Is the NHS in for a tough ride in the coming months?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24817487</url>

      <body>The NHS knows it's coming, but the big question is whether it can do anything about it. Winter is traditionally the toughest time for the health service, particularly for AandE departments. Waiting times are often at their highest as hospitals struggle to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors with injury and illness. And it looks like this year will be the worst one for a long time. Last winter the NHS in England missed it's waiting time target from January to March as waits hit their longest for nearly a decade. Any hopes that this was a one-off blip have already been dismissed. The summer was the worst on record for many years. The major AandEs - known as type one - missed their four-hour waiting time target during the spring and summer. It prompted Labour to accused the government of overseeing the "first summer AandE crisis in living memory". Doctors are worried too. Bernadette Garrihy, of the College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that staff were preparing for "what may be our worst winter yet". "We have got severe weather problems on the way, increased incidence of respiratory tract infections - things like winter vomiting bugs - we know that this puts our departments under huge pressure." But NHS England's medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh says plans are in place to help relieve the pressure. The government made an extra £250m available in the summer to help this winter. Another £250m will follow in a year's time. This is going direct to the worst-hit AandEs as well as surrounding community services, such as getting pharmacies to open longer. The idea is to give patients with less serious conditions more options other than AandE. Sir Bruce believes the early planning this year will help "decongest" some of the pressure points. But it is clear the problems are much more deep-routed than that. A quarter of visits to AandE lead to an emergency admission, suggesting many patients do in fact have a serious health issue that needs treating and, therefore, cannot be diverted to other parts of the health service. These have been rising since the late 1990s. A National Audit Office report published last week showed rates had risen by 47% in the past 15 years. Of these, a fifth are estimated to be avoidable - that is to say if the patient received better care in the first place the emergency would not have materialised. The frail elderly are the major cause of these admissions, presenting with problems such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. This shows if better support was available in the community there could be a significant reduction in demands on AandE. However, tackling this requires long-term solutions - something NHS England has already recognised as it has set up a review of the whole system. The plans for the future are to be unveiled later this month, but it will be several years before they have an impact. For the time being, those on the front-line in the NHS are bracing themselves for the a long, hard slog in the coming months. </body>

      <description>My year with a lopsided grin and an eyelid on strike</description>

      <body>One year on, the BBC's Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth reports on his slow recovery from Bell's palsy, and frowns, almost symmetrically, at the lack of medical awareness about the condition. It may have taken a whole year, but the muscles on the left hand side of my face have been slowly drifting away from the picket line and getting themselves back to work. The strike, it seems, is over. My left eyebrow, the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do - smile and blink. Shortly after the onset of my Bell's palsy, in October last year, I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter. The response was overwhelming, with many, many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition. So, exactly 12 months on, by way of returning some of that generosity, this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets. Bell's palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight - and unwitting - members of a very strange club. There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they can't move half of their face. Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company, including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan, it is not a club that anyone would choose to join. The paralysis can be shocking and, socially at least, very difficult to deal with. The hardest part for me, as well as the loss of my smile, was the inability to close my left eye. Bell's Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open, unable even to blink, sometimes for months on end. Of course, the other, unaffected eye carries on as normal, merrily blinking away. So, for the record, my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought I'd been winking at them for the past year or so. Except the barmaid in the Nag's Head. That was a wink. The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting. With my left eye stuck open, the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same - in manic two-eyed stare - or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers. Move over Anne Robinson. Thankfully, as the above video shows, at some time between the six- and nine-month mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again. Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus, often at times of stress and lowered immunity, much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed. The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear. Signals then cease to be transmitted along it, paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless. The only treatment that has been shown to have significant, measurable benefit is a course of steroids, but it must be started early, within 72 hours of the onset. These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve. Remarkably, despite this clear evidence, a recent study has shown that many people (more than 40% in the UK) are still not getting the appropriate treatment. And the same study shows that Bell's palsy is more common than previously thought. The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than 7,000 new cases every day. One year ago, as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis, Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity, Facial Palsy UK, which campaigns for better UK services for Bell's palsy and a range of related conditions. "The information available online about Bell's palsy at the moment is pretty appalling," he tells me. "And there is very poor data because there is not enough research." The illness, he believes, is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis. But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take. One patient, a professional musician, is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone. Another, a receptionist, is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public. In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph. As one of the UK's leading experts in the treatment of the condition, Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases: Of course the two questions any new Bell's palsy sufferer wants answered are, "Will I get better?" and "How long will it take?" The good news is that most people make a full recovery - many within a matter of weeks. Something like 70% of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year. Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category. Even without steroids, as my own case shows, most people get back to normal. The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and, by the time I realised how important they were, it was too late. I'm left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them. I'll never know, because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they don't guarantee it. Estimates suggest that up to 30% of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset. Five per cent of sufferers will experience after-effects that are severe and long lasting and, as a result, face the possibility of serious psychological distress. "It may be even harder nowadays," Mr Nduka says. "Face is everything - Facebook, Facetime, Skype. We live in a very image-conscious age." As for me, well I'm almost back to normal, as you can see from the video. I've been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye. But recovery can continue for up to 18 months and the blink, being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve, is often one of the last things to return. Anyway, I'm not complaining. So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement, advice and good humour. You made a difficult 12 months so much more bearable. And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than they'd like, a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more.

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063</url>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy, the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentle man". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <body>A man who ran an online "wallet service" for storing Bitcoins has claimed hackers stole virtual currency from his site worth more than one million Australian dollars. The Australian man said 4,100 Bitcoins (US$1.04m, £650,000) were taken in two separate attacks. He said he would not report the theft to police as Bitcoin transactions are virtually impossible to trace. This has led some users to speculate whether it was an "inside job". In a radio interview with ABC News the man, who only used his online name TradeFortress, denied being involved. The Bitcoin virtual currency is increasingly used to pay for things online. According to the Sydney Morning Herald, the theft occurred on 26 October but users were only alerted this week via a message he posted on the wallet service's website. "I know this doesn't mean much, but I'm sorry, and saying that I'm very sad that this has happened is an understatement. "Please don't store Bitcoins on an internet-connected device, regardless if it is your own or a service's." Bitcoin is the most well known of a handful of virtual currencies. The currencies are developed through a computer process called "mining" and can be traded on exchanges or privately between users. </body>

      <title>Bookshops lash out at Amazon offer</title>
      <description>An initiative by Amazon to sell Kindle readers in independent bookshops is met with hostility among shop owners.</description>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <body>A man who allegedly created malware purporting to catch out cheating lovers has made it on to the FBI's "most wanted" list of cybercriminals. The FBI says Carlos Enrique Perez-Melara ran a website offering customers a way to "catch a cheating lover" by sending spyware masquerading as a greeting card. Opening the card downloaded the malware on to the recipient's computer and recorded keystrokes and messages. The "Lover Spy" program cost $89 (£55). Mr Perez-Melara was indicted in July 2005 but has avoided capture ever since, only now making it on to the FBI's most wanted list. He ran the operation from his San Diego home in 2003, the FBI says, while he was in the US on a student travel visa. The charges against Mr Perez-Melara, 33, included making, sending and advertising an interception device, and unlawfully intercepting electronic communications. The indictment said Lover Spy was designed "with stealth in mind, claiming that it would be impossible to detect by 99.9% of users". But Mr Perez-Melara has avoided the authorities ever since and his last known location was San Salvador, the FBI said. The agency appears to have added the hacker to its list partly out of frustration at his elusiveness. "These are sophisticated folks who know how to hide themselves on the internet,'' said John Brown, who oversees the FBI's cyber-division. The agency has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest. According to the 2005 indictment, Mr Perez-Melara sold the malware to 1,000 customers, who then used it to infect the computers of about 2,000 victims. Victims took the bait about half the time, the government said. People who bought the spyware were charged with illegally intercepting electronic communications. </body>

      <body>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's official website has been hacked by people claiming to be members of the hacking group Anonymous. The attack comes a day after Mr Lee said he would track down the group. He made the comments after a person claiming to be part of the group posted an online video in which he threatened to hack government websites. Singapore's internet and phone regulator said part of the website had been "compromised" late on Thursday. "The PMO main website is still working, and we are working to restore the page that has been compromised," the Infocomm Development Authority said in a statement. The hackers had posted an image of a Guy Fawkes mask - the symbol of the Anonymous group - on the PM's website with the words: "It's great to be Singaporean today." Under new rules, unveiled by the Media Development Authority earlier this year, sites "that report regularly on issues relating to Singapore and have significant reach among readers" require individual licences. The video, which was posted last month, had protested against the government's new rules for news websites. Earlier this week, Mr Lee said his government would "spare no effort to try and track down the culprits". "If we can find him, we will bring him to justice and he will be dealt with severely. You may think you're anonymous but we will make that extra effort to find out who you are," he added. Earlier this month, a hacker - dubbed The Messiah and claiming to be a part of Anonymous - hacked the website of Singapore's main paper, The Straits Times. He had left a message saying the paper's report on the video was misleading. According to reports, The Messiah also claimed responsibility for hacking the website of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council last week, the municipal branch of the prime minister's district. Hackers linked to Anonymous have defaced dozens of websites belonging to Australian businesses and Philippine government agencies during the past week. </body>

      <title>Instagram grapples with drug adverts</title>
      <description>Facebook blocks searches for some topics associated with photos used to publicise the illegal sale of drugs via Instagram but leaves others active.</description>

      <body>Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. The photo-themed social network took the measure after being asked to respond to an investigation by #BBCtrending - a new social media series. The journalists had uncovered many pictures and videos of narcotics posted alongside text advertising their sale. Instagram is owned by Facebook. The firm has a policy of acting on posts reported as being inappropriate, but it believes it would be impractical and invasive to search for such material. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." Among Instagram's "report photo/video" choices is the option to identify suspected drug use. The BBC understands Facebook's staff aim to review posts flagged to either of its social networks within 48 hours. They also have the option of blocking terms classed as "bad hashtags" - ones that promote banned activities - if they are mentioned in the press or in user reports. The only content Facebook does actively search for is images of child abuse. Most of the drugs-related activity appears to be taking place in the US. "Just getting a few packs ready for tomorrow morning... Place your order today, it gets shipped out at 8AM tomorrow," read one post placed beneath an image of bags of marijuana. Another picture showed a variety of pills, adding: "$2 a pop for xans, $10 a pop for roxys." This refers to Xanax, a psychoactive anxiety treatment, and Roxicodone, an opiate used to treat pain. Both require prescriptions in the US and the UK, but are sometimes bought on the black market. Crystals of MDMA and other amphetamine-related substances were among other drugs advertised via photos and videos. In many cases the buyer and seller arranged to finalise their deals using WhatsApp or Kik - instant messaging apps in which they could keep messages private. Like Instagram, accounts can be set up on these services without revealing either party's true identity. Instagram is not the only social network on which drugs are advertised. The BBC has also seen instances of the practice in comments below some videos on Google's YouTube service. But while it is relatively common for the person who uploaded a drug-themed photo or video on Instagram to be the one advertising the sale of the substance, on YouTube the person posting the ad tends to do so below videos belonging to others. Like Facebook, Google relies on users reporting a problem before taking action. "We take user safety seriously and have guidelines that prohibit any content encouraging dangerous, illegal activities," said a spokeswoman for YouTube. "This includes content promoting the sale of drugs. YouTube's review teams respond to videos flagged for our attention around the clock, removing millions of videos each year that violate our policies." One drugs abuse researcher - who has advised the UN, World Health Organization and the UK government - said he was concerned by what he had seen. "I'm not particularly sophisticated on the internet, and it took me 10 seconds to see posts selling class-A drugs on Instagram," said Prof Neil McKeganey, founder of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research, in Glasgow. "Here is a public space being used to trade some of the most dangerous substances that we know are being abused. "I absolutely feel there is a responsibility to take proactive action. "It seems to me far too serious for those who own the companies that provide the public space through which this is occurring to simply say it's up to contributors to bring this to their attention." UK-based drugs treatment charity Addaction said it too wanted social media companies to act "swiftly and vigilantly", adding that it believed the companies could make a positive difference if they did. "Social media is a great way of reaching out to millions and millions of people," said spokesman Elliot Elam. "That's why we'd like to see providers of these sites work with organisations like ours, so they can find ways to engage with any users who may be struggling with drug or alcohol problems." Google and Facebook are not the only companies that rely on user reports to indentify potential drugs deals. Yahoo's blogging service Tumblr confirmed it had the same policy. "For legal reasons, we do not proactively monitor the site," said a spokeswoman. "We respond to reports of activity that is illegal or against our policies pursuant to those policies and relevant law." Although the BBC found photos of illegal drugs on Tumblr, searches for the terms that brought up associated adverts on Instagram did not appear to do so on Yahoo's service. This is not the first time Instagram's self-policing policies have been called into question. In August the Fusion.net blog suggested that the illegal psychedelics 2C-I and 2CB were also being advertised via the app. Vice Magazine also highlighted that marijuana and several kinds of prescription pills were promoted on the service. However it suggested that banning related hashtags would not solve the problem, saying "users would get more creative and choose other labels". More recently US senator Edward Markey wrote to the service's chief executive, Kevin Systrom, asking him to look into reports that unregulated gun sales were being conducted through the app. "Other companies that enable online sales have enacted commonsense protocols," he wrote. "I encourage Instagram to take similar steps and adopt safe business practices that curb the marketing and sale of guns." #BBCtrending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <body>Electric carmaker Tesla's Model S has suffered its third fire in five weeks. In the latest incident, which took place on Wednesday in the US state of Tennessee, a fire broke out in a car after it hit debris on the road. Tesla said the fire did not start spontaneously but was the result of the accident. The previous two fires have also been related to accidents. The firm's shares fell more than 7% on Thursday, after a 14% fall on Wednesday triggered by weak earnings. The company reported that it made a net loss of $38m in the July-to-September period. In the latest incident, the front of a Tesla vehicle burst into flames after it ran over a tow bar near the town of Smyrna, Tennessee. Analysts said that while the fires had been the result of accidents, investors had been worried about any potential impact on the firm. "For a company with a stock price based as much or more on image than financials, those recurring headlines are highly damaging," said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, added that the risk of a formal investigation by US safety regulators "could raise near-term concerns to a higher level in terms of cost, image and production disruption". Tesla's shares fell 7.5% to close at $139.7 on Thursday. In October, a Model S caught fire after the driver ran over what Tesla said was "an extremely large object" near Seattle, Washington state. After the fire, officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had said they found no evidence to indicate that it resulted from defects or violations of US safety standards. The second incident took place in Mexico later in the month. According to reports a car caught fire after it drove through a roundabout, crashed through a concrete wall and hit a tree. Tesla said it is investigating the latest incident in Tennessee to find out what had caused the fire. "Our team is on its way to Tennessee to learn more about what happened in the accident," Tesla spokeswoman Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean said in a statement. "We will provide more information when we're able to do so." The firm's chief executive, Elon Musk, has previously said that electric cars are safer than conventional cars. </body>

      <title>Vodafone fails on 3G mobile coverage</title>
      <description>Ofcom names Vodafone as only operator that has failed to reach 90% of the population with its 3G mobile services.</description>

      <body>Mobile firm Vodafone has been rapped by regulator Ofcom for failure to meet its coverage obligations. When 3G mobile spectrum licences were awarded in 2000, they included an obligation to roll services out to 80% of the population. In 2010 this was increased to 90%. EE, Three and O2 are deemed to have successfully met this obligation. But Vodafone falls short by 1.4%. It has promised to rectify this by the end of 2013. It will involve rolling out 3G to more mobile masts than it had originally intended. "Ofcom is fully aware of our plans to ensure compliance by the end of this year," the firm said in a statement. "Our network investment stands at more than £900m this year alone and we remain on track to deliver indoor coverage across 2G, 3G and 4G to 98% of the population by 2015, two years ahead of the regulator's deadline," it added. Ofcom will monitor its progress and reassess its 3G coverage in January 2014. Mobile coverage is a huge bugbear for consumers and one that Ofcom is determined to prioritise. Recently it produced a report suggesting that mobile coverage on Britain's roads was poor. Next year it will report on the mobile coverage on the country's railways. Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum thinks that it will be little hardship for Vodafone to comply. "I don't see it being very much of an issue for them to catch up and quite probably it will happen before the end of the year," Customers can take heart from the current 4G rollouts, he said. "4G coverage will be better and much more likely to be complied with given the spectrum at 800MHz travels further distances and penetrates buildings well." </body>

      <body>A US company has unveiled build-your-own toy robots that can drive, wiggle and react to the world around them. The modular system, called Moss, uses magnetic balls as joints and hinges, has no external wires, and works without the user having to write any computer code. By attaching a Bluetooth module, players can control the robots remotely using a smartphone or tablet. The system has been developed by Modular Robotics in Boulder, Colorado. The company launched the toys on crowdfunding website Kickstarter. But chief executive and design director Eric Schweikardt told the BBC: "We're already making Moss so we don't need the Kickstarter funding. But in 2013, it seems like the place where people look for cool new tech products." The final version of the robot kits would "begin shipping in January or February", he said. "We're at the very beginning of an exciting time for consumer robotics." Hod Lipson, professor of engineering at Cornell University, New York State, said: "Modular robotics have been around for decades, and we've always believed they could be cheap, robust and versatile. In practice, they've proved to be expensive and fragile. "Modular Robotics is one of the first companies putting in the effort to mass-produce these things." He believes such toys could help make robotics accessible to young children and interest them in engineering from a young age. Although he used to teach Mr Schweikardt, Prof Lipson stressed that he had no financial interest in the company. In October, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed off cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes. The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and stick together using magnets. </body>

      <body>A battery-powered robotic arm that boosts human strength has won the 2013 James Dyson award. The Titan Arm, designed by four mechanical engineering students from the University of Pennsylvania, could help people with back injuries rebuild and regain control of muscles. It can also be used by people to lift heavy objects as part of their work. The team, who spent eight months creating the exoskeleton, will share a prize of £30,000 ($48,000). "Titan Arm is obviously an ingenious design, but the team's use of modern, rapid - and relatively inexpensive - manufacturing techniques makes the project even more compelling," said Sir James Dyson. "We are ecstatic," team member Nick Parrotta told the BBC. "It was totally unexpected - just incredible." The team produced its prototype for £1,200, which they say is a 50th of the typical cost of similar exoskeletons currently on the market. "We wanted Titan Arm to be affordable, as exoskeletons are rarely covered by health insurance," said Mr Parrotta, 23, currently studying for a masters in mechanical engineering. "This informed our design decisions and the materials we used. Most structural components are machined from inexpensive aluminium." Academic and commercial interest in wearable robotics is growing according to Conor Walsh, Professor of of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. But costs will have to continue falling if robotics are to feature more often in daily life, he said. "Reducing cost will be critical for commercial systems, however the total cost is not just the cost of the hardware but also the added cost associated with research and development, quality assurance and regulatory compliance." The Titan arm incorporates a rigid back brace to maintain posture, a shoulder featuring rotational joints, and sensors that can track motion and relay data back to doctors for remote prognosis. It can augment human weight-lifting strength by 40lbs (18kg), say the inventors, while the batteries can last for up to eight hours, depending on intensity of usage and workload. The current prototype is operated by a separate joystick, but future versions may incorporate electromyography technology, said Mr Parrotta, which picks up electrical signals produced by muscle tissue, thus allowing users to operate such prosthetics almost without thinking. All of the inventors who took part in the competition used 3D-printing to develop and produce their prototypes much more cheaply than would have been possible before. "Prototyping technology, previously reserved only for companies with big research and development budgets, is enabling young inventors to develop sophisticated concepts at university," said Sir James. "They can revitalise industries on a small budget - it is a good time to be an inventor." The second prize went to a Japanese team who created Handie, a prosthetic hand with sensors that can read brain signals. A 3D-printed plastic cast for broken limbs, invented by a team from New Zealand, took the third prize. The James Dyson Foundation runs the annual award across 18 countries with the aim of encouraging problem-solving inventions. </body>

      <description>Shares in the micro-blogging site Twitter close at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26, after the firm's first day as public company.</description>

      <body>Shares in the microblogging site Twitter closed at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26 each. That means after its first day as a public company, Twitter is now valued at a little over $31bn (£19bn). More than 13 million shares were traded once they became available an hour after the New York Stock Exchange opened. It is the biggest technology listing since Facebook in 2012. Twitter floated on the NYSE and not, as some initially expected, the technology-rich Nasdaq exchange, where the likes of Facebook are listed. It was a big win for the NYSE, which decorated its exterior with banners promoting the offering on Thursday. Twitter has more than 230 million users, but is yet to make a profit. Shares in newly listed companies are often volatile on their first day of trading. Within minutes, Twitter's stock price soared more than 80% before closing just below its initial opening price of $45.10 per share. When Facebook launched on the Nasdaq, its shares were priced initially at $38 each. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45. But its price later slumped. It only recovered those losses by 11 September 2013, when shares again touched $45. Its initial public offering (IPO) was also marred by technological glitches and delays. To prevent Twitter's stock sale from having a similar fate, the NYSE ran tests on 26 October using larger-than-normal share volumes. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise more than $1.82bn. The company, which invites users to send tweets in 140 characters or less, has 232 million active users. According to its IPO documents, these users send 500 million tweets a day. Twitter's financials have been under greater scrutiny since it announced its plan to float, especially given that the company is still loss-making. It lost $69m in the first six months of 2013 on revenues of $254m. About 85% of revenues come from advertising on its site, and more than 75% of Twitter users access the site from their mobile phone. Mary Jo White, head of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently warned investors to be cautious of the metrics used by technology companies such as Twitter, noting that investors have become overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of data. "In the absence of a clear description, it can be hard not to think that these big numbers will inevitably translate into big profits for the company," she said in a speech. "But the connection may not necessarily be there." Twitter's founders saw their paper wealth soar to $4bn in the wake of the stock surge early this morning, although boss Dick Costolo said that none of the founders would immediately be selling their shares. The company's co-founder Evan Williams has a 10% stake in Twitter, making him its biggest shareholder. That stake is now worth a little over $2bn. Jack Dorsey, another co-founder, also stands to make a fortune from the IPO. His 4% stake is worth more than $1bn. Another co-founder, Biz Stone, is thought to have made millions of dollars by selling share stakes over the past few years. Big fortunes aside, after the hoopla of the morning it was very quickly was back to work: Twitter employee Melissa Daimler posted a photo of employees at their desks just hours after the NYSE bell was rung. </body>

      <body>Microsoft has confirmed it is in talks with the Spanish football club Real Madrid to acquire naming rights to its Bernabeu Stadium. The 85,454-seat venue is currently named after its former president Santiago Bernabeu. Speaking on Spanish television, the president of Microsoft in Spain said discussions were at an early stage. "They've raised... renaming the stadium and we're only talking about this possibility," said Maria Garana. Online reaction to the news included possible new names for the stadium. "At most the stadium will be called the Microsoft Estadio Santiago Bernabeu," said one forum member. "The Gates Ground?" was a suggestion on Twitter by @HuffPostUK, in a nod to the company's founder, Bill Gates. Others wondered whether Microsoft would use the opportunity to promote its products. "Will it be called the Surface and feature players like Cristiano RonalDOS?" tweeted @tomwarren from technology news website The Verge. The Surface is Microsoft's tablet computer and DOS was one of the company's former computer operating systems. The announcement was not well received by all fans of the club. "I'm a Real Madrid fan, I hate Microsoft forever if they touch anything related to Madrid," said Haidi Farnoud. If Microsoft are successful in obtaining the naming rights, they will join a group of several other companies whose names are linked to stadiums. In the English Premier League, the airline Emirates has a tie-in with Arsenal, while Etihad sponsors Manchester City's ground. The German club Bayern Munich play their home matches in the Allianz Arena after signing a 30-year deal with the financial services company. But not all stadium renaming deals have been successful. When Newcastle United changed the name of their ground from St James' Park to the Sports Direct Arena in November 2011, the local council refused to use the new name on official street signs. At the time, the council said the decision to change the name would "upset the overwhelming majority of fans". </body>

      <body>Driverless cars will be tested for the first time in a UK town after £1.5m was made available from the government. The "pods", which will travel at 12mph (19km/h), will ferry people around Milton Keynes on designated pathways. Twenty driver-operated vehicles will be running by 2015, but it is hoped 100 fully automated versions will be introduced by 2017, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said. Similar pods currently operate at Heathrow Airport. It forms part of a £75m government scheme to enable businesses to make and test low carbon technologies, which it says will keep the UK at the forefront of engine design and help to safeguard up to 30,000 jobs in engine production. The electric-powered pods can be booked via a smartphone app and will be able to accommodate two passengers. While travelling, they will use sensors to avoid obstacles. In the automated versions, passengers travelling to their selected destination will be able to browse the internet, check emails, read the newspaper and play games inside the pod. The cost of each journey has not yet been decided. If successful, they could be used in other towns and cities across the UK, the government said. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: "By 2050, very few - if any - new cars will be powered solely by the traditional internal combustion engines, so it is important that the UK car industry is at the cutting edge of low carbon technologies." Early collaborators on the project include the engineering firm Arup and the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Google has been licensed to experiment with driverless vehicles in the US, claiming that in testing it logged more than 300,000 miles (482,803km) in its cars without an accident. </body>

      <body>Rivals Microsoft, Google and Facebook have joined forces to offers bounties to "friendly hackers" who can hunt down web bugs. The tech giants have put their differences aside in pursuit of a "safer internet". Dubbed Hackerone, the bug bounty programme offers cash rewards between $300 (£186) and $5,000 (£3,110) for discovering security holes. The size of the reward will be determined by a panel of employees. It may go higher if the discovery is deemed important enough. Anyone is eligible to enter the competition, except those from countries with which the US has trade restrictions, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria. Children are also welcome to join in although they will need to claim their bounties from their parents. The bounties will be paid by Microsoft and Facebook with Google supplying a member of staff to sit on the panel. The team has suggested areas that people may want to look at. It includes some of the key pieces of software that make the web work as well as offering a category simply labelled "the internet", which comes with a minimum bounty of $5,000. Tech firms are stepping up efforts to battle hackers and ensure the internet is safer. Microsoft has its own independent bounty programme and it recently raised the prize fund to $100,000. The need for such bounty hunters was illustrated as Microsoft announced on the same day that a brand new security hole in Windows could allow criminals to get control of users computers via malware-injected image files. The flaw means that anyone opening a malware-filled TIFF image could find malicious code installed on their computer without them knowing. The bug is a so-called zero-day vulnerability, which means that it was not known about until real-life instances of attacks became apparent. </body>

      <title>Kenya gets e-centre to cut red tape</title>
      <description>Kenya's president launches a "one-stop shop" to access and pay for government services electronically in order to cut corruption and bureaucracy.</description>

      <body>Kenya's leader has launched a "one-stop shop" to access and pay for government services electronically in order to cut corruption and bureaucracy. President Uhuru Kenyatta said public inefficiency had bred corruption, wasted time and "cost billions". A pilot centre has been set up in the capital, Nairobi, where customers can access a range of self-service counters linked to government databases. Known as Huduma centres, they will be rolled out across the country. Huduma, which means "service" in Swahili, is part of a government plan to fully digitise government services. Kenya is one of Africa's most technologically advanced countries, with a widely used mobile phone money transfer service and a cluster of tech start-ups. But President Kenyatta said this had yet to reach government services: "For a long time Kenyans have been subjected to moving from place to place in search of services from the government," he said at the launch of the pilot centre. "Kenyans and visitors became accustomed to being frustrated numerous times in their quest for public service: 'Come tomorrow'; 'Go to this or that other office first'; 'Bring a copy of your identity card'; and so on. "Endless, static queues have been the order of the day, wasting countless hours. Public service became the epitome of inefficiency. This inefficiency bred corruption, initiating a cycle of vice which has tormented many and cost the country billions." The BBC's Odhiambo Joseph in Nairobi says dealing with Kenyan bureaucracy can indeed be a costly and time-wasting business. Our reporter says he took a whole day off work to order a replacement of his ID card. It involved reporting the loss at a police station, going to a district officer to have the loss certified, then going to the national ID office and queuing for forms. He then joined another queue to submit the forms and then had to wait to be called for finger-printing and queued again to have a photo taken. At most stages, he was asked for money and then there was at least a three-month wait until the card was ready, which involved queuing again to collect it, he says. Under the new system, our reporter should be able to report the loss and apply for a replacement ID card at the Huduma centre - and as the system is connected directly to a government database, there would be no need for finger-printing and photos as his records could be automatically accessed. In properly managed queues, the president said Kenyans would be able to access 18 services from 10 government agencies - from renewing a driving licence and applying for health insurance to registering a business and paying for parking. "I urge Kenyans to expect and demand the highest service standards. I also remind all public servants that rude, reluctant, slow, or negligent service is illegal," Mr Kenyatta said. It was also matter of urgency for all government departments to digitise and automate their records and procedures, he added. Our correspondent says that once Huduma is rolled out, people should be able to track their applications online or through their mobile phones and will also be able to use some services without going into a centre. </body>

      <title>Fire hits Internet Archive building</title>

      <body>The non-profit organisation behind the Internet Archive has made a plea for donations following a fire at its building in San Francisco. The group runs the popular Wayback Machine, an archive of 364 billion web pages, designed to show people what sites looked like in years gone by. No data was lost, a spokesman said, but the damage was estimated at $600,000 (£373,000). He said: "It is in difficult times like these that we turn to our community." On the group's blog, founder Brewster Kahle wrote: "This episode has reminded us that digitising and making copies are good strategies for both access and preservation. "We have copies of the data in the Internet Archive in multiple locations, so even if our main building had been involved in the fire we still would not have lost the amazing content we have all worked so hard to collect." However, the fire did cause the loss of some materials that were being prepared for digitisation - the full extent of which is still being assessed. The Internet Archive was founded in 1996 with the intent to store the world's digital content, such as web pages, music, moving images and e-books. In October last year, the group announced that it had stored more than 10 petabytes - 10 million gigabytes - of information. As well as the Wayback Machine, the group also runs other archiving schemes - such as TV Search and Borrow, a collection of US national news programmes that can be obtained, for free, on DVD. The Internet Archive system was praised recently for allowing access to US government websites that were knocked offline thanks to the federal government shut-down last month. Thanks to the fire, the scanning centre in San Francisco will need to be either heavily repaired or rebuilt, Mr Kahle said. In the meantime, as well as donations, the group is seeking help in setting up scanning operations in different locations. </body>

      <body>The mystery of why Google has moored two barges off the US coast appears to have been solved. The search giant has issued a statement saying it intends to use the structures as learning spaces for people to find out about new tech. The announcement follows feverish media speculation over the past fortnight about the company's plans. One popular theory had been that the vessels would be used as floating wave-powered data centres. Government inspectors had signed confidentiality agreements about the four-storey building in San Francisco Bay and another similar structure off Portland, Maine. "Google Barge... a floating data centre? A wild party boat? A barge housing the last remaining dinosaur?" a spokeswoman joked. "Sadly, none of the above. Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barges as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology." </body>

      <title>Concept car ditches steering wheel</title>
      <description>Toyota previews a concept car that lacks a steering wheel, instead suggesting drivers would control it by shifting their body weight.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24837760</url>

      <body>Toyota has suggested motorists of the future could ride about in a vehicle inspired by a horse. It has announced a concept car that drivers would control by shifting their body weight while standing, doing away with the need for a steering wheel. One analyst said the current design posed too many safety issues, but did point towards future developments. The FV2 vehicle will make its official debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in two weeks' time. Toyota suggested leaning forwards, backwards or to the side to determine the FV2's direction would be "intuitive", adding that voice and facial recognition sensors would bring up information to assist users in their journeys. Suggested destinations and other data would be shown on an augmented reality display presented on the windscreen, it said. The aim was to develop aspects of trust and understanding between the vehicle and the rider "similar to those a rider will have with a horse". "This is an imagination piece rather than something that will be seen in production in the next few years," a spokesman told the BBC. "But some of the technologies we're suggesting could be introduced further down the line - say in five to 10 years' time." Carmakers often release images and models of imagined futuristic vehicles to coincide with motor shows. Although they are sometimes little more than a publicity stunt, they can be valuable as a way of seeking early feedback and helping determine where research and development funds should be invested. It can still take a long time for successful ideas to come to fruition. For example, Toyota first showed off the idea of making a hybrid - combining both an internal combustion engine and an electrical propulsion system - in 1977 when it unveiled a special version of its Sports 800 GT at the Tokyo show. It was 20 years later that it released its first hybrid for sale to the public - the Prius - in Japan. Other examples of tech first seen in concept vehicles include panoramic glass roofs, now found in some Renault and Mercedes cars among others, and using touchscreen panels to do away with dashboard buttons, as is the case in Tesla's Model S. One expert said the Toyota's latest design was intended to address a problem worrying the industry at large. "Lots of carmakers are very frightened by the fact many young people can't afford a car and insurance, and the whole concept of a traditional motor vehicle doesn't really appeal to them," said Paul Newton from the consultants IHS Automotive. "I think in practical terms the FV2 won't see the light of day - if you are standing up and leaning to move it, my first thought would be, what if you hit something? The likelihood of it being licensed in today's safety-conscious environment is zero. "But concepts are the proving ground for lots of technologies that do come into mainstream production, and many things will happen in the next 25 years that will redefine what we've probably spent a good part of century looking at as the norm." Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Honda are among the other firms who have announced they will be unveiling concept vehicles at the Tokyo Motor Show, which runs from 22 November to 1 December. </body>

      <title>Call of Duty faces frame-rate issues</title>
      <description>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game report problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24834842</url>

      <body>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game have reported problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title. Testers said that its frame rate dropped at several points during the game causing a stutter-effect. The PS4 version of CoD: Ghosts is the only console edition that renders its images in 1080p high definition. The Xbox One and Wii U versions create less processor-intensive 720p resolutions. Publisher Activision has not commented. Although the PS4 version of the game is already on sale, Sony's console itself will not be released until 15 November in North America and 29 November in Europe. That potentially gives Activision time to release a software patch if the issue can be fixed. Ghosts is the 10th first-person shooter game in the main CoD series. Its predecessor, Black Ops II, earned $1bn (£621m) in its first 15 days of release, making it the second fastest-selling game of all time after Grand Theft Auto 5. Earlier this week, the head of Activision's Infinity Ward studio - which developed the newest title - told the BBC that his team had made delivering smooth animations a priority. "One of the key pillars of Call of Duty has been 60 frames per second... and ensuring that was of utmost importance, and the resolutions that appear are geared around that," said Mark Rubin. Elsewhere he suggested that the different way the new consoles handled memory had contributed to a decision to support 1080p graphics on Sony's machine but not Microsoft's. However, some reviews have suggested the PS4 version does not maintain a consistent frame rate as desired. "The PlayStation 4 version... has noticeable technical issues, sometimes slowing to a crawl, particularly during set-piece moments with multiple effects," reported Joystiq. "Frame rate hitches happen throughout the campaign on PlayStation 4 and, in a series known for its Hollywood-inspired bombast, it detracted from the experience." Now Gamer added that it was particularly concerned about the issue occurring during the title's online multiplayer mode. "It's rare - it only happened once every few matches - but it is definitely present," it said. "It's not something we've seen in any Call of Duty multiplayer before, so it stood out as particularly odd and unfortunate, given the frame-rate stutter is significant enough to let targets escape to safety or see you killed during the general mayhem." The blog Gearnuke has gathered together other complaints of a similar nature. Although Activision has yet to provide a statement, Mr Rubin had previously acknowledged: "There's enormous amounts of work ahead of us in perfecting our game engines on both [Sony and Microsoft's] platforms." Sony has not commented on the subject. However, Microsoft has addressed the fact the Xbox One version of Ghosts renders graphics in half the resolution of the PS4, despite the fact both consoles support the 1080p format. "Once people have the chance to play the games and experience Xbox One for themselves, we believe they'll realise that great-looking visuals are only part of the experience," said a spokesman. "Launch is the first of many steps into the new console generation, and we fully expect our developers to continue to break new ground and surpass previous limitations in the years ahead." Reviews of the Xbox One version of Ghosts remain under embargo until 12 November. </body>

      <body>A robot developed by Japanese scientists is so fast it can "win" the rock-paper-scissors game against a human every single time. The Janken robot - named after the game's Japanese name - is a faster version of one unveiled by University of Tokyo researchers in June 2012. Version two completes its chosen hand shape almost at the same time as the human hand. It uses high-speed recognition and reaction, rather than prediction - effectively cheating. BBC Click's LJ Rich talks to Lucy Hockings about the robot. </body>

      <title>The retreat of free internet content</title>

      <body>Fortune writer Adam Lashinsky seemed stunned and bemused by the blowback from his readers. He had written about the 3G buyout of Heinz on the professional networking site LinkedIn, and added: "Fortune [where I work] published a longish preview of the article here. The full version is here, and you'll have to be a Fortune subscriber to read it. No apologies by the way. The kids say they can get everything they need to read for free on the internet. Sorry. It's not true." Readers erupted. The most "liked" comment, 319 up to the time of publishing, was this: "If your Fortune article is as empty of content as this LinkedIn article, I think I'll stick to the free sources. Please refrain from spam postings." Mr Lashinsky wrote a combative follow-up defending subscription. He was unapologetic. "As far as the readers of my post were concerned, I had committed the cardinal sin of social media, which was to link to an article for which they had to pay", he tells the BBC. "To paraphrase their response, how dare I tell them about something that was not available to them for free." So, are the battle lines being drawn between free and subscription? Tumbling ad revenues and circulation are hitting traditional newspapers hard, making some of them charge for content. "Advertising is weakening on newspaper sites and online sites because you can target the ads through Google and Facebook to individual people," says blogger Andrew Sullivan. He made the one-million-readers-a-month The Dish a standalone blog, taking it out of the Newsweek/Daily Beast site and charging readers $20 (£12.50) a year. "We media have to find another model that does not rely on advertising. It's not actually working financially in the long run," Mr Sullivan says. "Advertising-supported news was a glorious accident," adds Mr Lashinsky. "We need other revenue streams. Subscriptions are a good one." Many readers seem resistant to paying for online content. Some sites have designed metered models that recognise that. The New York Times brings down a pay curtain after 10 free articles a month. The Times, in the UK, makes the start of articles visible, and directs readers wanting to see more to pay to access the rest. The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times have a combination of pay, free and registration content. Some sites have promotions for free or reduced subscriptions, or bundles with other product and services offers. Into the picture has stepped Jeff Bezos, of Amazon, who brings to a historic title, the Washington Post, a dose of modern start-up and retail savvy. Computer science engineer Robert Cailliau is the often unheralded other half of the story of inventing the world wide web, alongside Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The web was initially a system to connect the world's universities, which did not have a simple way of accessing each other's remotely stored academic papers and documents. Mr Cailliau, a Belgian, is now retired from Cern (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Geneva) and lives in France. He says that the idea of "dealing with the value of information" has been around for 20 years. "It was impossible for someone to say, 'I worked very hard to put up this information to keep these articles up to date… I want you to pay me, say one cent every time you click on one of my pages.'" Mr Cailliau thinks that monthly subscriptions are too expensive and restrictive. He says the pay-as-you-go mobile phone model is a great one for online content. "When you send an SMS, you pay a small amount of money. Each individual action should be billed individually," he says. "My browser should pay you automatically a cent or two cents per page without me feeling it. I should not have to prepay a large amount of money." "Why re-invent? The telephone already does that. We already have a worldwide system that's capable of billing the customer for every move he makes." Tien Tzuo is chief executive of Zuora, a San Francisco subscription management company. Its clients include News International - parent company of the Times - and Fairfax, owners of some of the largest titles in Australia. "Two cents a view is one possible model, but not necessarily the best," he says. "Your wireless plan now has prepaid plans, post-paid plans, family plans, nights and weekend plans, unlimited plans, bundles. "And people actually do not like feeling metered, they don't like being on a phone call and feeling like they have to get off the phone." What does he think his fellow West Coast entrepreneur Mr Bezos brings to the newspaper business? "People forget that Amazon built warehouses and distribution centres - a bricks and mortars operation to go with the internet side," he answers. "For newspapers, some people still want the printed product on their commute on the bus or the train. "On weekends at the kitchen table, people like to spread out the Sunday papers, and take out their favourite section." Can online media survive without subscriptions? "No," says Mr Tzuo firmly. "For freemium models like Evernote and Dropbox, there's enormous value in the free product, but eventually you need customers to pay. That's the best economic foundation for your organisation. "The gravy train is over. There is no more advertising subsidies that can power newspapers." Digital platforms cost money to build, but we still get much of our online content for free. That may be changing, but the question of the most effective way of balancing reader browsing habits with businesses' need to be viable, is far from settled. </body>

      <body>It is nearly 12 years since Bram Cohen decided to create a faster way to share large files over the internet. His invention, the BitTorrent protocol, allows computers to download a single file from multiple sources simultaneously, and - at the same time - to upload the sections, as they become available, to others. It took a while for the technique to catch on, but it has become pirates' tool of choice to copy movies, music and other media. It also has legal uses. Mr Cohen is now the chief scientist at the San Francisco-based firm BitTorrrent. The company has teamed up with musicians including Madonna, Moby and the Pixies to help them share and sell content to fans via its Bundle product. It is also pitching its Sync service as a way to synchronise data between computers without sending the information to remote servers that could potentially be accessed by the NSA or other cyber-spies. The BBC's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor met with Mr Cohen and asked him about his invention's legacy, and how having Asperger Syndrome had affected his work.

      <body>Instagram, the photo and video sharing network owned by Facebook, is usually associated with light-hearted 'selfie' photos, or amusing memes. But it also has a darker side, and has become a marketplace for a wide range of illicit goods. So long as you know the right hashtags to search. Thousands of pictures showing drugs on offer can be found on Instagram by searching keywords. In response to this investigation by #BBCTrending, Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comments, so we can take action." "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." BBC Trending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <title>Twitter: It's worth how much?!</title>
      <description>How do you value a company like Twitter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24819238</url>

      <body>Twitter's much-anticipated launch on to the markets is fizzing with fanfare and debate over how - given that it has never made money - the microblogging site, priced at $26 per share, is officially worth more than $18bn (£11bn). The facts seem to contradict themselves. Twitter's growth is slow, and it shows no sign of making a profit - its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier. And more than half of its total registered users don't even use it. But some analysts predict that in the months post-share sale, the seven-year-old company's worth will increase to $20bn and beyond. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than double the likes of global carmaker Fiat, with its very modest-sounding market capitalisation of 6.9bn euros ($9.3bn). But Twitter is not alone in its sector when it comes to big price tags, if not profits. Online "scrapbooking" website Pinterest was valued at $3.8bn in October after its latest round of investment, giving it the same value, in terms of market capitalisation, as the UK's second largest house-builder Barratt Homes. Yet while Barratt has reported a full-year pre-tax profit of £192m for 2012-13, Pinterest has never made any money. Its digital "pinboards" may be attracting users, there may be talk of advertisers paying for posts, but it has no revenue yet. So why do these social media companies have this value attached to them? Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told the BBC it was a bit like buying a house. "You look at what other people are paying for something a little bit like what you are buying," he said. "[But] you have to think about whether you are going to price [the company] or value it." Twitter, Mr Damodaran believes, is being priced by bankers and brokers - not valued - and that pricing is coming from comparing it to its peers. By this he means that value is something more complex and emotional, but that pricing is based on at-the-time comparisons. Most notably, with Facebook. "The big difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook was making money [when it launched its IPO in 2012] and Twitter is losing money," said Mr Damodaran. Facebook had a billion active users when it launched its shares. While Twitter is growing its user base rapidly - up 39% over the past year to 500 million - only 232 million of these are active each month. According to a recent report by analysts Pew Internet, 72% of internet users in the US use social networking sites, but just 18% use Twitter. Plus, while users are invited to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters, many do not engage on the platform at all, leaving their registered accounts dormant. Others prefer to simply follow news feeds and favourite celebrities instead. This can cut the amount of time people spend on the site, and in turn the opportunities for advertisers to catch their attention. Facebook's IPO famously ran far from smoothly, and its shares quickly halved in price, before recovering slowly over the next two years. "Twitter is also entering a more crowded market than Facebook," said Mr Damodaran, "and there are many more queuing up to join." Therefore, he added, Twitter should be valued at about $10-15bn. He wrote recently that "at $20 billion, it is a moon shot". Chris Orndorff, who manages billions of dollars for clients at Los Angeles-based Western Asset Management, believes value is a lot to do with cash flow. "One of the best ways to value a company is to figure out the present value of the cash flows," he said. "For a more mature company, this is easier to do because they have a history of earnings, and generally reliable predictions about future earnings and cash flows. "Relatively new companies do not have the history." Therefore, he added, the stock was more likely to be volatile. "The susceptibility of social media companies to changes in consumer tastes also makes valuing those companies much more challenging," he said. Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of the travel website Lastminute.com, told the BBC she was confident Twitter could make money and hold its value. "Yes it is a scrabble for revenue," she said, but the company "has an astonishing amount of money in the bank". Advertising income from mobiles, rather than desktop computers, now accounts for over 70% of advertising revenue, and here, believes Ms Lane Fox and others, Twitter may be able to flourish. She also predicted "a huge number of interesting deals and partnerships" that could boost it further. A lot of the "value" or pricing of these companies depends on a future demand for services, as well as possible advertising streams. But, as past deals demonstrate - that future isn't always predictable. Famously, ITV bought the website Friends Reunited for £175m in 2005, but in 2009 Brightsolid paid ITV just £25m for the site. It had been superseded. Its "value" had been eroded. Its customers, the key to any company, had, in large numbers, moved on. Similar problems were encountered at one of the early social media pioneers, MySpace. In 2005 News Corp purchased MySpace for $580m. When it was sold in 2011, its price tag had fallen to a reported $35m. It too had been overtaken, and users abandoned its offering. But, for San Francisco-based CBS technology analyst Larry Magid, these cautionary tales make the newer clutch of technology companies stronger. "MySpace is a constant reminder that a high and mighty service can lose its lustre. However, the lessons of MySpace were not lost on Facebook, Twitter and services that followed," he said. "I think the difference [now] is the execution and the demographics. To succeed, Twitter needs a diversified audience that transcends a particular demographic. MySpace was focused on youth - a particularly fickle audience." Mr Damodaran said: "A lot of very valuable companies today - including Google - were once small, money-losing companies." And Mr Orndorff agreed: "The valuation is reasonable if the company can continue to grow its user base, generate cash flow from advertising, and successfully fend off the competition. If not, then it will be remembered - or forgotten - like many of the 1998-99 tech bubble companies, and generate plenty of tax losses for investors." </body>

      <description>Beck, Arcade Fire and the music videos inviting fans in</description>

      <body>Picture the scene: you're at home watching the latest concert by your favourite musician. The crowd is raving, the singer approaches them holding the microphone out and a few people climb past security onto the stage. But alas, stuck in front of your computer screen, you can't join them. Except now you can - if you're a fan of American musician Beck, that is. He is one of a few artists making interactive music videos requiring fan participation. Throughout his 20-year career the industry has seen many changes, including more people now watching music videos on YouTube than on MTV. Beck has made many memorable music videos, though he started out with limited means. "[For] my first video we had no money," he says. "I had a friend who had film in the freezer left over from film school and we used that one roll of film. "Every frame was precious." The video in question was for his hit song Loser, which went on to sell half a million copies and became one of the defining singles of the 1990s. "I was surprised when some of these videos actually got played," he continues about his early releases. "Most of them were just friends who were making them and editing them." Since then the 43-year-old has collaborated with acclaimed directors such as Spike Jonze and Michael Gondry on his music videos. Earlier this year he took this one step further, developing a 360 degree experience with director Chris Milk. In Hello Again viewers can join Beck onstage or stroll around among the 170 musicians as they play David Bowie's Sound and Vision. Viewers move around by turning on their computer's webcam and moving their heads in the direction they want to move in. For Beck, music videos can create a strong connection between bands and fans in the digital age. "I grew up in an era where the packaging was such a big part of how you related to the music," he says. The cover of Psychocandy, the first Jesus and Mary Chain album, which has a bold design and stark red, white and black colour scheme, had an especially strong influence on how he related to the band and came to understand them. "It gave me enough information, it opened up a whole idea about where this music is coming from and what it was." He believes music videos can fulfil this role in today's digital era where there is less emphasis on physical records. "I felt that they were album artwork come to life," he says about these videos. The Google Creative Lab's Aaron Koblin has directed several interactive music videos. The 31-year-old heads the data arts team and grew up in the era of big budget videos which played a large role in teen culture, but says the fan was passive. "When I used to watch music videos it was very much 'I am receiving the content which is helping me understand and create a picture of the musician's identity'," he says. "But it didn't necessarily make me feel all that much closer." He thinks interactive web-based videos enable a new way of creating that bond. He has worked with Arcade Fire on videos that require fans to interact with the band. "I hope we can create a deeper emotional experience which will then help bring a better connection," he says. Together with director Vincent Morisset, he aimed to do just that with the Just A Reflektor project, which uses the title track from Arcade Fire's latest album. Fans connect their smartphone to their webcam via a unique code on the video's site. By moving their smartphone around viewers can change the visual effects on the video, creating sprinkles of light and colour. They also can guide the protagonist on her journey and eventually join her. "Your phone and computer are actually talking to each other," Mr Koblin says. "The computer is observing and talking about the phone's location and movement and in doing that is able to construct and change the story based around the way the phone is being moved around." While videos are increasingly being viewed on the internet, interactive web-based ones are still rare. Just A Reflektor uses new code and tools, that were specifically created for the Google Chrome browser. "These things aren't that easy to make yet," Mr Koblin explains. Creating these new tools is currently the most expensive part of making these videos. "That's part of why when we create them we're releasing a lot of the code that we used and a lot of the tools that we created so we can encourage other people to get involved." Arcade Fire have tried the interactive experience before in another experiment for Google Chrome. The song We Used To Wait was used by Mr Koblin and Mr Milk to become the interactive experience The Wilderness Downtown, which uses Google Earth to bring a new dimension to the song. Viewers type in their home address and will see images of where they grew up within the video. Jordan Gauthier is an Arcade Fire fan and says their interactive videos have strengthened his relationship with the band. He grew up in the French suburban town of Rennes and says The Wilderness Downtown made him relate to the song in a new way by helping him recall his childhood memories. "It's like putting your own memories into the video," he says. "I thought that was amazing." Ultimately Beck thinks the web opens up numerous possibilities to interact with fans. "I think that's an infinite idea," he says. "That kind of idea is going to spread because the technology exists." He points to the success of crowdfunding in other fields and thinks more videos will source their ideas and materials from fans in the future. Mr Koblin and Mr Milk crowdsourced for The Johnny Cash Project, which features the song Ain't No Grave. Released after Cash's death, the interactive site pays tribute to him through a video made up of stills drawn by fans. Viewers can then select and watch the frames in different orders. As material is continuously being added to the project, every viewing is unique. Crowdsourcing can also build closer bonds between fans themselves, according to British director Ninian Doff. He crowdsourced images of fans dancing to make the video for Graham Coxon's What It'll Take. One hundred fans sent in videos from 28 countries, and Mr Doff cut up all the videos for the final piece. "It's a big jumble," he explains. "Sometimes it's one person's legs and another person's top half, or it's one person's legs, one person's body, one person's head. "It's like making a Frankenstein out of fans' bodies." And people managed to find themselves and each other through leaving comments about the video online. "One person commented saying, 'Oh that's me at 2 minutes 5 seconds'," Mr Doff says. "Then another person replied, 'I'm your legs at 2 minutes 5 seconds'. "They'd managed to meet over the internet through being connected in the video." </body>

      <body>No-one knows exactly who is behind them, but in towns, villages and cities right across the UK, "Spotted In" Facebook pages are springing up - offering a kind of local information, dating site, and lost and found service all rolled into one. From big cities and towns like Cardiff and Reading, to the small village of Grampound in Cornwall, these sites are increasingly popular. In many places, more than one in 10 people are following their local "Spotted In" site. Almost all have been set up within the past year. The posts are a dizzying splash of late night post-pub sprawls, people shopping in pyjamas, and information about firework displays - all rolled up in typically British humour. Popular posts on the Spotted in Andover site include a cat found in bin - who became known locally as "Bin Cat" or "Stealth Pussy" - and the "so bad it's good" local rapper video (which spurred its own parody). Lost pets, wallets and ID are more regular fare - as is online flirting. "There are lots of happy endings... We are still waiting for our first engagement and wedding. It will happen though!" Some Spotted sites deal with serious subjects too. Spotted in Ipswich - which has more than 13,000 likes - was the first to expose a local man who claimed to have terminal cancer as a fraud. Also hugely popular are sites like Spotted on a Bus, Spotted on the Train, and Spotted on the Road. Some Spotted sites have had problems with bullying and harassment and have closed down - the most successful ones operate strict house rules and are carefully moderated. "It's almost like a forum for the town," says the admin of Spotted in Chippenham - who admits that being privy to the Wiltshire town's most "juicy secrets" is one of the perks of running the site. "Just to hear people say 'Did you see that on Spotted last night' is brilliant. My mum often talks about it and so does most of Chippenham." Spotted in Chippenham - like other sites - though is run anonymously. Not even his mum knows. Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <body>Back in the 1970s, Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak, and the rest, if you like, is history. The two became firm friends and although Steve Jobs often gets the credit for Apple's success, it was Woz, as he's known, who was the brains behind the silicon. He spoke to the BBC's technology programme Click. Computers are on the verge of understanding human gestures and speech, but it has not yet been perfected. Wozniak says he often finds Android human speech recognition software is more accurate than Apple's Siri. "Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is. And very often usually I find out that Android does." Wozniak says this is due to Android's access to Google's search engine. "That is actually the future of intelligence probably for computers getting smarter and getting artificial intelligence. I wish to God that Apple and Google were partners in the future." But how likely would a partnership between the two companies be? "I don't know. If I were there, it would be pretty likely. I'm probably wrong, there's probably an awful lot I don't know about the business concerns and one thing you've got to remember is a company has always got to make money," says Wozniak. Encouraging openness and sharing information and methods would benefit everyone to develop the best technology, Wozniak says. "I believe you should have a world where you've got to license something at a fair price. There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone. I wish Apple would use them and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us," he says. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology, all our products would be better, we'd go further. I do wish they were more compatible." Wozniak believes more sharing between companies would lead to developments in bigger and better technology in wearable tech, like smartwatches and augmented reality glasses. "I want a full smartphone-like capability on my wrist. The trouble is the more I think about it, I don't want the small size. "We're just at the verge of having products that have foldability and flexibility," he says. "For about three or four years I've been talking about organic LED displays that could be theoretically printed on plastic, wrapped and folded," he says. "But think outside of the box. It could be on the inside of your arm and then when you flip your arm up it could actually flip open into your own hand." Despite his legacy, Wozniak is not seen as an Apple insider these days. But he is still beloved by many of the Mac faithful. "His comments aren't influential in any shape or form. He was one of the founders of Apple and walked away, so the fan boys love him. He is free to say anything he likes," says Stuart Miles, founder of technology news website Pocket-lint. "I don't think he has any insight or influence into the inner workings of how Apple works. But nonetheless he is a fascinating storyteller," he says.

      <body>A US company that has developed an "electronic backpack" that fits onto a cockroach allowing its movements to be controlled by a mobile phone app has defended itself against cruelty claims. The Backyard Brains company says that the device is intended to get children to be interested in neuroscience. A spokeswoman told the BBC that the device - being formally launched on Saturday - was not a gimmick. But critics say that the company's stance is "disingenuous". For the "electronic backpack" to work the cockroaches have to be placed in icy water to subdue them before sandpaper is used to remove the waxy coating on the shell of the insect's head. An electrode connector and electrodes are then glued on to the insect's body and a needle is used to poke a hole in their thorax in order to insert a wire. Their antennae are then cut and electrodes are inserted. A circuit is attached to their backs, and signals are received through a mobile phone app allowing users to control the cockroaches' movements to the left and to the right. Animal behaviour scientist Jonathan Balcombe has been quoted on US scientific websites as saying that the insects are harmed in the process. "If it was discovered that a teacher was having students use magnifying glasses to burn ants and then look at their tissue, how would people react?" he is quoted as saying. Likewise Queen's University philosophy Professor Michael Allen warned that the device will "encourage amateurs to operate invasively on living organisms" and "encourage thinking of complex living organisms as mere machines or tools". The Michigan-based company has even received emails saying the the backpack - known as Roboroach - "teaches kids to be psychopaths". But Backyard Brains says that 20% of the world will soon have a neurological disorder - for which there are no known cures - and the backpacks "allow students to do graduate level research early in life". A company spokeswoman told the BBC that the backpack had been developed solely to encourage children to take an interest in neuroscience which, she said, needed to be better taught in American schools. "At the moment this crucially important subject is woefully under-taught," she said, "with many schools teaching neuroscience within the biology syllabus when it should be a subject in its own right. "That is especially the case when diseases of the brain such as Alzheimer's take a heavier toll within society." The spokeswoman insisted that the insects are treated humanely and that the backpack - first developed in 2011 - does not harm them. The backpack will be widely available in November in the US priced at $99 (£61). </body>

      <title>Rat cull to 'save seabirds' begins</title>
      <description>Internationally important seabird populations on the Isles of Scilly are being protected by a scheme to kill more than 3,000 brown rats.</description>

      <body>A project aimed at protecting internationally important seabird populations on two of the Isles of Scilly by killing more than 3,000 brown rats, is under way. The islands, which are located off Cornwall, are home to breeding populations of 14 seabird species and approximately 20,000 birds. Eradication experts from New Zealand and the UK have been contracted to carry out the work. "Among many challenges our seabirds face, the greatest threat on land is predation of eggs and chicks by brown rats," said Jaclyn Pearson from the Isles of Scilly Seabird Recovery Project. "The brown rats were accidently introduced to islands from shipwrecks in the 18th Century," she added. The project is part of a 25-year programme to protect "internationally important" seabird numbers, including those of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels, and is costing more than £755,000. The rodents will be poisoned on St Agnes and Gugh by Wildlife Management International Limited (WMIL). The company has helped eradicate rats from Ramsey Island off Wales, Lundy Island off Devon and the Isle of Canna in the Scottish Hebrides. Elizabeth Bell, from WMIL said: "A period of intensive baiting will start from the 8 November and most of the rats will be dead by the end of November. We'll then target the surviving rats." A long-term monitoring programme will start at the beginning of 2014 to check the rodents have been eradicated from the islands. Ms Bell said all the bait stations were enclosed, tied down and were designed not to kill any other species, such as rabbits. Ms Pearson said: "The project is 25 years in length, although the project team will disband after five years, for the remaining 20 years the community will continue to protect their seabird heritage, by keeping the islands 'rat-free'. "This includes correct waste management, ensuring bio-security on boats and freight to the islands, and of course, educating all visitors to the islands to be vigilant and 'rat on a rat'". "This is the largest community-based island restoration project attempted in the world to date, with 85 residents living here year round." She added that similar populated islands around the world hoped to learn from the project and carry out similar work to "safeguard their seabirds". A feasibility study estimated the population of brown rats on the Isles of Scilly was about 34,500, with 3,100 occurring on St Agnes and Gugh. Johnny Birks, chair of the Mammal Society, said: "Brown rats are not native to Britain... it's our own fault they are so widespread and that makes it right for us to repair the damage we've caused." He added that the eradication could benefit the Scilly shrew and other species found on the islands, but it was key that the rats did not reinvade. Ms Pearson added she was "certain" rats on neighbouring islands would not swim to St Agnes and Gugh. "The shortest distance over water from St Agnes and Gugh to an island which has rats, is between Gugh and the Garrison on St Mary's. "This distance of about one mile (1.6km) is just under the maximum distance a rat can swim in favourable conditions, but the deep channel, strong current and cold sea temperature all year round will make it highly unlikely that a rat can swim back." Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB, said: "Eight out of ten islands around the world now have rats, including remote places such as Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic and Henderson Island in the South Pacific. "The predators are known to have impacted on the populations of 75 species of seabird, from albatross to shearwaters to small petrels. "In response, there is a worldwide effort to rid islands of these voracious creatures," he added. In January, Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) South West, said we have a "collective responsibility for the native wildlife on the Isles of Scilly". HLF has awarded the project £269,100, alongside £460,255 from the EU Life fund , with further contributions from Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Beauty Sustainable Development Fund and Natural England. </body>

      <title>India Mars probe makes first burn</title>
      <description>After a successful launch on Tuesday, India's Mars spacecraft has carried out the first of six crucial engine firings in Earth orbit.</description>

      <body>After a successful launch on Tuesday, India's Mars spacecraft has carried out the first of six crucial engine firings in Earth orbit. The probe performed the firing with its liquid fuel thruster at 19:47 GMT on Wednesday (Thursday 1:17 IST). The aim is to gradually build up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. If the firings succeed, the spacecraft will travel for 300 days, ready for entering Mars orbit in 2014. K. Radhakrishnan, head of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told the Times of India that the spacecraft was in "excellent health". After lift-off, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) was placed into an elliptical parking orbit around Earth with a perigee (the point in the orbit closest to Earth) of 248.4 km and an apogee (the point farthest away) of 23,550 km. The six major thruster firings are designed to manoeuvre the MOM into a so-called hyperbolic trajectory so that the probe escapes the Earth's sphere of influence. After a 10-month journey, the probe will arrive at Mars on 24 September next year. The engine will be fired again to slow down the spacecraft, enabling it to be captured by the planet's gravity and place it into Martian orbit. Four further manoeuvres between 8 and 16 November will raise the craft's apogee to 192,000km. "It's going to be a large sequence of events," said Mr Radhakrishnan. On 1 December, the engine will be fired again for its "trans-Martian injection", sending the craft on its way to the Red Planet. This week, Prof Andrew Coates, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, told BBC News that the planned mechanics for getting to Mars were on a sound footing, and that the probe stood a good chance as long as its engines fired correctly. But any delay in these operations would require precious extra fuel to be used to catch up with the desired path to Mars. India's PSLV rocket - the second choice for the mission after a beefier launcher failed - was not powerful enough to send the MOM on a direct flight to Mars. So engineers opted for a method of travel called a Hohmann Transfer Orbit to propel the spacecraft from Earth to Mars with the least amount of fuel possible. At a cost of about $72m (£45m), the MOM is extremely cheap by the standards of planetary missions. Even so, some commentators have questioned whether India should be spending its millions on a planetary mission when a significant part of its population are in poverty and figures for childhood malnutrition are some of the highest in the world.

      <body>The Hubble telescope has spotted an asteroid radiating six comet-like tails, making it resemble a "rotating lawn sprinkler". Other asteroids appear as tiny points of light to astronomers, who are puzzled by the outbursts of dust. Asteroid P/2013 P5 has been ejecting dust periodically for at least five months and may be in the process of breaking up. They have outlined details in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters. "We were literally dumbfounded when we saw it," said Prof Dave Jewitt, from the University of California at Los Angeles. "Even more amazing, its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust. That also caught us by surprise. It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid." Astronomers say it is possible the asteroid's rotation rate increased to the point where its surface started flying apart. Radiation pressure from the Sun could have sent the space rock spinning, to a point where the asteroid's weak gravity could no longer hold it together. Astronomers will continue observing P/2013 P5 to see whether the dust leaves the asteroid in the equatorial plane. Because of the physics involved in the spin rate theory, say the astronomers, this would provide strong evidence for a rotational breakup. They do not believe the tails are the result of an impact with another asteroid because they have not seen a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once. Astronomers discovered the object in August, using the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii. At the time, P/2013 P5 looked unusually fuzzy. The multiple tails were discovered when Hubble was used to take a more detailed image on 10 September. </body>

      <title>Japan to remove Fukushima fuel rods</title>
      <description>Nuclear engineers in Japan prepare to move more than 1,000 fuel rods from the crippled Fukushima power plant in a crucial, but risky operation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24843657</url>
      <date>1383820575</date>

      <body>A task of extraordinary delicacy and danger is about to begin at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power station. Engineers are preparing to extract the first of thousands of nuclear fuel rods from one of the wrecked reactor buildings. This is seen as an essential but risky step on the long road towards stabilising the site. The fuel rods are currently in a precarious state in a storage pool in Unit 4. This building was badly damaged by an explosion in March 2011 following the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Moving the rods to safety is a high priority but has only become possible after months of repair work and planning. One senior official told me: "It's going to be very difficult but it has to happen." The fuel rods are four-metre long tubes containing pellets of uranium fuel and the fear is that some may have been damaged during the disaster. When the tsunami struck the Japanese coast, the flood swamped the diesel generators providing back up power to the reactors. Three of the reactors went into a state of partial meltdown. By coincidence, Unit 4 was undergoing maintenance, so all of its fuel rods were being stored. But the meltdown of a neighbouring reactor led to a build-up of hydrogen which is believed to have led to the explosion in Unit 4. In the days after the tsunami, there were fears that the blast had damaged Unit 4's storage pool and, in desperation, the authorities used helicopters and fire hoses to keep it filled with water. A guiding principle of nuclear safety is that the fuel is kept underwater at all times - contact with the air risks overheating and triggering a release that could spread contamination. So the operation to remove the rods will be painstaking. A senior official in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) told me that the rod assemblies will be lifted out in batches of 22 and in casks filled with water. This will be done with a new crane, recently installed in the wrecked building, after the original one was destroyed. The task of removing each batch will take 7-10 days, I understand. Two critically important issues are whether the rods themselves are damaged and therefore likely to leak and whether the casks remain watertight to ensure the rods have no contact with the air. The METI official acknowledged the risks including a possible "release of radiation" from the fuel or if the casks holding the fuel are dropped. He said that "countermeasures" have been prepared - including back-up wires to hold the loads and mechanisms to hold the fuel in the event of a power failure. A briefing document released by the site's owners, Tepco, spells out a series of safety systems designed to minimize the dangers. For example, the fuel pond itself has been strengthened while the new crane can handle loads of one tonne while the fuel cask only weighs 450kg. Collision tests, it is said, have shown that even if the fuel cask is dropped, it may be deformed but its seals will not be broken. The fuel rods will then be deposited into a new "common" pool with a cooling system. According to the METI official, "the common pool is planned to be used over a long period, supposedly for 10 to 20 years, and will be reinforced against possible future earthquakes and tsunamis". The Tepco document says the rods will be checked for signs of damage - large amounts of debris fell into the pool during the disaster so the risks are real. It says that checks for corrosion have found only minor signs so far - with "no corrosion affecting fuel integrity". But only when the operation begins will engineers get a detailed look at the rods and a chance to assess their state. One senior figure in Japan's nuclear watchdog told me: "Inspections by camera show that the rods look OK but we're not sure if they're damaged - you never know." He said Unit 4 presented particular dangers because its entire stock of fuel rods was in the pool at the time of the accident. If the operation goes as planned, attention will then focus on the massive challenges posed by Units 1, 2 and 3. According to the METI official, the latest investigations have shown that despite the meltdowns experienced by each reactor, their temperatures have now stabilised. In Units 1 and 2, readings show the presence of water in what's called the primary containment vessel - suggesting that the melted fuel rods have not penetrated that safety barrier. The radiation level is too high in Unit 3 for that kind of examination to be carried out but using data from the reactor pressure vessel the official assumes that water is also present in the primary containment. Meanwhile, the site continues to be plagued by leaks of radioactive water flowing into the Pacific Ocean. Tepco will not confirm the precise timing of the fuel rod operation but after so much public outrage at the company's handling of the crisis so far, scrutiny of this latest episode will be intense. </body>

      <title>US moves to ban trans fats in foods</title>
      <description>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to Americans' health.</description>

      <body>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to health. Trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils, are no longer "generally recognised as safe", said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulator said a ban could prevent 7,000 deaths and 20,000 heart attacks in the US each year. The FDA is opening a 60-day consultation period on the plan, which would gradually phase out trans fats. "While consumption of potentially harmful artificial trans fat has declined over the last two decades in the United States, current intake remains a significant public health concern," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a statement. "The FDA's action today is an important step toward protecting more Americans from the potential dangers of trans fat." If the agency's plan is successful, the heart-clogging oils would be considered food additives and could not be used in food unless officially approved. The ruling does not affect foods with naturally occurring trans fats, which are present in small amounts in certain meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats are used both in processed food and in restaurants as a way to improve the shelf life or flavour of foods. The fats are created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil, making it a solid. Nutritionists have long criticised their use, saying they contribute to heart disease more than saturated fat. Some companies have already phased out trans fats, prompted by new nutritional labels introduced in 2006 requiring it to be listed on food packaging. New York City and some other local governments have also banned it. But trans fats persist primarily in processed foods - including some microwave popcorns and frozen pizzas - and in restaurants that use the oils for frying. According to the FDA, trans fat intake among Americans declined from 4.6g per day in 2003 to around 1g per day in 2012. The American Heart Association said the FDA's proposal was a step forward in the battle against heart disease. "We commend the FDA for responding to the numerous concerns and evidence submitted over the years about the dangers of this industrially produced ingredient," said its chief executive, Nancy Brown. Outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the charge to ban trans fats in that city, said the FDA plan "deserves great credit". "The groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in New York City have become a model for the nation for one reason: they've worked," he said. </body>

      <title>Fossil fuel subsidies 'are reckless'</title>
      <description>A new study suggests the world is spending seven times more money subsidising fossil fuels than fighting climate change in developing countries.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24833153</url>

      <body>The world is spending half a trillion dollars on fossil fuel subsidies every year, according to a new report. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) says rich countries are spending seven times more supporting coal, oil and gas than they are on helping poorer nations fight climate change. Some countries including Egypt, Morocco and Pakistan, have subsidies bigger than the national fiscal deficit. The new report calls on the G20 to phase out the payments by 2020. While there is no globally agreed definition of what a fossil fuel subsidy actually is, the report draws on a range of sources from the International Monetary Fund to the International Energy Agency. It details the range of financial help given to oil, coal and gas producers and consumers from national governments and through international development. What emerges is a complicated web of different types of payments in different countries. In the United States, for example, the government in 2011 gave a $1bn fuel tax exemption to farmers, $1bn for the strategic petroleum reserve and $0.5bn for oil, coal and gas research and development. Germany gave financial assistance totalling 1.9bn euro to the hard coal sector in the same year. And the UK gave tax concessions worth £280m in 2011 for oil and gas production. The report accuses rich governments of "shooting themselves in both feet" by undermining attempts to put a price on carbon and by giving no incentive to companies to switch from high carbon fuels. "This is a reckless use of public money at a time when people are very concerned about energy costs," Kevin Watkins, executive director of the ODI, told BBC News. "Why are we spending $112 per adult in the OECD countries subsidising an energy system that is driving us towards dangerous climate change when there are alternatives?" In developing countries, the report says the subsidies often take the form of keeping fuel prices low to help alleviate poverty. Governments in Indonesia, Pakistan and Venezuela are spending twice as much on fossil fuel subsidies as they are on public health. "Almost all these subsidies go to those who are connected to the grid because the governments give money to the energy providers, who pass it on to consumers. "The top 20% of these societies get around half of the total subsidy package," said Kevin Watkins. International finance for development is hugely focussed on oil, coal and gas. According to the ODI, 75% of energy project support from international banks went to fossil fuel projects in 12 of the highest emitting developing nations. The research adds to data from the International Energy Agency that says global subsidies for fossil fuels are six times higher than those for renewable energy. The OECD has stated that coal is subject to the lowest levels of taxation. The ODI hopes that enough countries in the G20 group will follow up on promises made to look at the issue. The institute believes that subsidies for energy are similar to subsidies for agriculture that plagued international trade negotiations in the 1990s. Ultimately, agreement was found on removing them. The ODI believes there can be a similar outcome for fuel supports. "This has to be the mother of all win-win scenarios," said Kevin Watkins. "You'd have a win for taxpayers, a win for governments north and south and you'd have a win for the planet as well." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc. </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

      <body>A Soyuz rocket carrying the torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics has docked with the International Space Station, as part of efforts to showcase next year's games in Russia. On Saturday, two Russian cosmonauts will take it on a historic first spacewalk. The torch will not be lit. The event is part of a rebranding exercise by Russia, designed to portray it as a strong, modern country, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Baikonur. The rocket left Earth at 04:14:25 GMT. It blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, crewed by three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata from Japan. The Olympic symbol will be handed over to fellow cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky, who are already on the orbiting station, when they go on the spacewalk on Saturday. "Our goal here is to make it look spectacular," Mr Kotov said earlier. "We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work." The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. It will not be lit aboard the space station as this would consume oxygen and pose a risk to the crew. The Sochi torch will then be returned to Earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year. It is all part of the elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It is also the most expensive one so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. In yet another minor setback, the flame has gone out several times since the torch relay began last month. </body>

      <body>An explosive volcanic eruption in Chile has given scientists the first direct insight into the strange motion of rocky lava known as obsidian flow. Rather than a red river of molten rock oozing down a mountainside, this lava is a thick, rubble-strewn mass of rock. Dr Hugh Tuffen, from the University of Lancaster, and his colleagues took the first measurements of this lava flow. They found that it kept moving more than a year after the eruption. Their results were published in the journal Nature Communications. To carry out their study, the team visited a volcano in the south of Chile called Cordon Caulle in January 2012. "There had just been an enormous eruption [in June 2011] that was still continuing," Dr Tuffen told BBC News. This explosive eruption produced rhyolite - the rock that creates the "incredibly sticky magma" that results in these strange obsidian flows. "This was our chance to get right in there and see an obsidian flow moving for the first time," he said. No-one had previously witnessed an obsidian flow moving. As well as witnessing the ongoing volcanic eruption, the researchers recorded the lava - a heaving mass of black rock more than 30m (100ft) thick - as it "slowly creaked its way down the mountain". Team member Prof Jonathan Castro from the University of Mainz in Germany captured footage and images of the flow. Piecing these images together produced a 3-D model of the obsidian flow's changing shape. "What was exciting was that it kept on going," said Dr Tuffen. "Even after the eruption had stopped - it was still flowing away many months afterwards." Initially, the lava advanced several metres per day, then as its thick rocky crust cooled, it slowed. But, according to Dr Tuffen's data, over a year after the eruption, the lava was still advancing at a rate of 1.5m to 3m per day. Crucially, the lava flow altered as pieces of the rocky mass collapsed and the hotter lava leaked out in what the scientists referred to as "breakouts". This, Dr Tuffen said, revealed "lots of secrets about how lavas advance". "So now we can make new models that can encompass all the different sorts of lavas on the planet and how they move." Dr William Burton, of the US Geological Survey, said: "What these guys have done is observe processes along the margins that may govern how these things flow - the breakouts. "Knowing what they learned in this paper may help predict where this flow is going to go next. "So if it is going close to a town you might be able to use some of the lessons they learned to [work out changes in its movement]." Dr Burton added that the most likely place for the next rhyolitic volcanic eruption was near Mono lake, in northern California - a popular ski area. Prof Peter Sammonds, an earth scientist from University College London, said the imaging techniques the team had developed would be "powerful" for the future study of volcanoes. "The modelling of these lava flows is quite important," he said. "These patterns can seen as a general feature [of volcanoes] - it doesn't simply relate to this one. Volcanoes that have produced rhyolitic eruptions are found all over the world, and have been some of the biggest on Earth. These include the US "supervolcano" eruptions at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, and Novarupta in Alaska, which erupted in 1912 and was the biggest of the 20th Century. </body>

      <title>Climate wavering 'not justified'</title>
      <description>Government advisers say the UK is not out of step with major nations in reducing emissions.</description>

      <body>Britain is playing its part in a worldwide bid to reduce emissions and should not weaken its proposed cuts, says a report to the UK government. The Committee on Climate Change says no change in global science or policy justifies a slackening of effort. The report was compiled after Chancellor George Osborne said the UK's competitiveness might be put at risk by leading the world in curbing emissions. The CCC research challenges this assumption. "It is not accurate to say that the UK is leading the world on this," the CCC’s chief executive David Kennedy told BBC News. "We aren’t acting alone. We have made ambitious commitments, but other countries have too – they are acting on them and developing low-carbon technologies. "Some of our European counterparts are discussing targets stricter than ours for 2030 so if we want to be part of the low-carbon revolution we will have to make sure we aren’t left behind." Mr Kennedy said China was now clearly global leader in clean technology: "China is leading the low-carbon revolution. It has committed to invest in 700 Gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2020 – that’s 10 times the whole UK power system. "They are investing in five million electric vehicles – in multiples of what we are doing here. “Even the US is cutting its emissions and is committed to doing so in coming years.” The shale gas revolution in the US has forced down emissions because gas is much less polluting than coal; the report says it is likely that the US will meet its commitment to reduce 2020 emissions by 17% on 2005 levels. It points out that China has committed to reduce carbon-intensity by 40-45% from 2005 to 2020, and introduced policies to deliver in its 12th five-year plan. With ongoing action, China’s emissions could peak in the early 2020s, the report says. It says Germany has also made medium-term commitments in line with the UK. But Mr Kennedy admitted that the world’s efforts were still nowhere near enough to keep the world on track for a high likelihood of a stable climate. The World Meteorological Organization has announced that greenhouse gases has reached another record. UNEP’s Emissions Gap report also warned that delaying emissions cuts would make the task even more expensive. The CCC was founded to advise government on how to meet the Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to reducing CO2 80% by 2050, in a step-by-step process. For several years the Chancellor has expressed fears about the impact of climate policies on the affordability of energy in the UK. At the Conservative Party conference he told The Times that Britain should not be "in front of the world" on tackling climate change. But the Climate Change Act was designed specifically to make it hard for future politicians to weaken long-term priorities when faced with political difficulty. In order to reduce the UK’s targets, there needs to have been a weakening of the science base or of international action. But the CCC’s report says: “We conclude in this report that, in respect of science, international and EU criteria, there has been no significant change in the circumstances upon which the budget was set. In this regard, there is therefore no legal or economic basis to support a change in the fourth carbon budget. A Treasury spokesman said: "We want to tackle climate change, but it should be done in a way that doesn't put huge costs on people's energy bills or destroys manufacturing jobs. The shale gas revolution in America shows you can reduce carbon emissions, bring bills down and create jobs." The committee thinks the UK is most unlikely to experience a US-style shale gas boom. The committee is concerned at the political backlash against green energy, which it believes has been fuelled by newspaper campaigns. It says renewable energy subsidies are likely to bring down energy bills in the medium term if gas prices continue to rise as many analysts forecast. Doug Parr from Greenpeace said: "The CCC reminds us that tackling climate change is as urgent as ever, but the Treasury persists with its scientifically illiterate campaign to unravel domestic climate policy. The Lib Dems must not allow a watered down fourth carbon budget." Rhian Kelly, the CBI's director for business environment, said: "It seems sensible to maintain the fourth carbon budget at this point in time. However, as the CCC suggests, it would be prudent for the Government to look again at the UK's emissions reduction pathway once EU discussions have concluded, to make sure we remain aligned." Jonathan Grant from consultant PwC said: "The Committee is right to highlight the danger of changing tack or rolling back regulations, as it could undermine business and investor confidence that long term government policy will deliver what is needed to tackle climate change. "In the short term, UK energy emissions increased 2.6% last year, much higher than GDP growth, because of an increased use of coal in power generation. The cost of wholesale transformation of energy generation and other green measures highlights the challenge that politicians are facing everywhere on climate change." Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <description>A new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the earth 80 million years ago is discovered in southern Utah.</description>

      <body>A new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the Earth 80 million years ago has been discovered in southern Utah. It was closely related to its slightly larger relative, Tyrannosaurus rex, but lived earlier, making it the largest living land predator of its time. Growing to about 30ft (9m) long, the predator has been named Lythronax argestes which means "king of gore". The research, published in the journal Plos One, highlights once more that the age of discovery is far from over. The team also hopes this new find will help uncover what the climate was like towards the end of the age of dinosaurs. "It's always exciting to find new species but what's really significant is what these species tell us about their ancient world," said Randall Irmis, co-author of the study at the Natural History Museum of Utah, US. "This was a very different place 80 million years ago. It was a very lush, wet, tropical environment and there were no polar ice caps at the time." First discovered in 2009, the partial skeleton included a number of bones from the skull and some from the rest of the body. The fossils were then excavated and studied in the lab. The new discovery was closely related to T. rex and shows that similar features evolved 10 million years earlier than previously thought. Lythronax had a short and narrow snout and forward slanting eyes. Like its evolutionary relative, it had a head full of sharp teeth and was a ferocious predator, the largest of its ecosystem. The team also uncovered the most complete fossils of another named species of Tyrannosaur - Teratophoneus curriei. It was previously only known from a few skull bones but the team now have more than 70% of its skeleton. "There's a whole diversity of different branches of the Tyrannosaur family tree that are waiting to be found out there," Dr Irmis told BBC News. It was previously unclear why there were so many different Tyrannosaurid species present in a similar area, as the animals were able to move around freely. The palaeontologists believe this was due to a changing of sea level. "We think that when the sea level was high it was isolating areas in western North America that caused different species to evolve in isolation and that's why we're finding so many different species," added Dr Irmis. He explained that the creature had been named the "King of Gore" because of its super-predator status. The second part of its name "argestes" comes from Greek poet Homer's naming of a south-westerly wind. "Tyrannosaurids were the really large predators in their ecosystem. It's fairly certain based on what we can see on their skull, teeth and body size they probably ate whatever they could fit in their mouths," added Dr Irmis. Another research member of the team, Joseph Sertich of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, US, explained that the back of its skull was very wide which gave it good hunting eyes. "One of the things that makes T. rex different from other dinosaurs is that it is able to look forward, it has binocular vision. Lythronax had that feature as well, its field of view could overlap which probably made it a better hunter," Dr Sertich told BBC News. "It was the apex predator of it's time. It was the oldest advanced Tyrannosaur of its group, which is quite surprising. "This is the tip of the iceberg. It's amazing what we're finding in southern Utah right now. You can walk over some of the hills and find fossils littering the sides of the slopes," he added. Mike Benton at the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved with the study, said the new find was important for understanding patterns of evolution of the Tyrannosaurids. "Previously, Tyrannosauri origins were uncertain, whether in Asia or North America, and the new find tends to suggest a mainly North American evolution for the group." </body>

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly discovered ligament identified in the knee may hold the key to common injuries, Belgian surgeons believe.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24826323</url>
      <date>1383811071</date>

      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used macroscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the new ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and its role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <title>Physics probes 'splashback' problem</title>
      <description>Scientists have studied the fluid dynamics of urine "splashback", with hygiene implications for men and women.</description>

      <body>US physicists have studied the fluid dynamics of urine "splashback" - and found tips to help men and women with their accuracy and hygiene. Using high-speed cameras, the team filmed jets of liquid striking toilet walls and studied the resulting spray. Splashback was low when the jets were used close up with a narrow "angle of attack", said the Brigham Young University team. They will present their research at an American Physical Society meeting. "In response to harsh and repeated criticisms from our mothers and several failed relationships with women, we present the splash dynamics of a simulated human male urine stream," reads their conference abstract. But there is a more serious side to the research. The work is led by Prof Tadd Truscott and Randy Hurd of the "Splash Lab" at Brigham Young in Provo, Utah, who jokingly refer to themselves as "wizz kids". "People ask me, are you serious? I tell them yes, this may involve 12-year-old humour, but it's also a real problem," Prof Truscott told BBC News. "We've all been in disgusting toilets with puddles on the floor - these places are a breeding ground for bacteria." For example, the detergents used to clean hospital toilets could actually increase the spray of disease-causing bacteria, by reducing the surface tension of water, according to a recent study. One might think the physics of aiming urination had already been summarised by the formula: "get it all in the bowl". But micturation is still a messier business than it needs to be, according to the research. Taking measurements live "in the field" did not appeal to the scientists, so the duo built a urination simulator. The "Water Angle Navigation Guide" is a five-gallon bucket with hoses connected to two types of synthetic urethra. The team fired coloured water at various target "toilets" at the velocity and pressure of average human urination. Then, using a high-speed camera, they captured the moment of impact in remarkable visual detail. Splashback was heightened by a phenomenon known as Plateau-Rayleigh instability, where a falling stream of liquid breaks up into droplets. "The male urine stream breaks up about 6-7 inches outside the urethra exit," Mr Hurd explained. "So by the time it hits the urinal, it's already in droplet form. And these droplets are the perpetrators of the splash formation on your khaki pants." His advice? "The closer you are, the better. If you can get stream impact with the porcelain, it's a lot less chaotic." Of course, in a domestic bathroom, distance from the toilet is governed chiefly by one variable: "to stand or sit". "People are always arguing over which is better. Because when you sit close, you're also closer to getting wet," said Prof Truscott. "In Germany there is a derogatory term 'sitzpinkler' for a man who sits down to pee. It means he's kind of a wuss. "So we wanted to look at whether sitting down is really effective. What are the splash differences?" To compare the two positions, the scientists gave rulers to their friends and sent them into the toilet. "It turns out you are five times as far away when you stand up - and that's a pretty significant difference in impact velocity for those droplets of urine," said Mr Hurd. Impact with the toilet water is captured in a video by the team. "You can see the droplets create a large cavity in the water, which then collapses, causing even greater splashback. The amount of splash is considerable," Mr Hurd explained. "It seems that sitting down is the best sure-fire way to avoid unwanted splashing in a traditional toilet." Above all, he says, "the biggest thing you can do" to reduce splashback - sitting or standing - is to alter the "angle of attack". Aiming directly at a vertical urinal wall - a 90 degree angle - causes a nasty kickback, as does aiming directly at the toilet water. "Narrowing the angle really helps," said Mr Hurd. For a typical urinal, "best practice" means standing slightly to one side, and aiming downwards at a low angle of impact. "This way you take advantage of both splash-reduction techniques," Hurd explains. Prof Truscott encourages men and women to "be artistic" with their aim and find an angle to suit the particular facility they are faced with. The designs of public toilets and home bathrooms does not always help us achieve 100% efficiency, he said. "Most surfaces you pee into, such as porcelain, are hydrophilic, which is a disadvantage. The water spreads across them, creating a puddle to splash into," said Mr Hurd. He believes that hydrophobic coatings will ultimately make toilets more hygienic, with important benefits for hospitals, schools, and workplaces. The Brigham-Young team has been "inundated" with commercial products to reduce spray - such as fabric inserts, urinals with triangular fins, and toilet bowls with unusually sloping angles. "Some work fantastically - others really don't work at all. It's almost worse than nothing," says Truscott. "My favourite is painting a fly on the wall to indicate where you should aim. Unfortunately, some companies put that fly in the wrong place." Sega has even developed a "Toylet" urinal game, installed in Tokyo Metro stations to award men points for accuracy. But Prof Truscott says one of the most effective tricks is also the simplest - drop a few pieces of tissue into a toilet bowl to soften the blow. The Splash Lab team plans to investigate further toilet designs and find "the optimal approach for urinal usage", removing some of the obstacles between men, women and bathroom harmony. </body>

      <title>Asteroid hit rate 'underestimated'</title>
      <description>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia this year has been underestimated, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia earlier this year is much higher than was previously thought, a study suggests. Researchers have found that space rocks of a similar size to the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk are hurtling into the Earth's atmosphere with surprising frequency. Scientists say early warning systems need to be put in place. The study is published in the journal Nature. Lead author Professor Peter Brown, from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action programme: "Having some sort of system that scans the sky almost continuously and looks for these objects just before they hit the Earth, that probably is something worth doing. "In the case of Chelyabinsk, a few days' to a week's warning would have been valuable." Fireball The asteroid that exploded over Russia on 15 February this year was estimated to be about 19m-wide. It hit the atmosphere with energy estimated to be equivalent to 500,000 tonnes of TNT, sending a shockwave twice around the globe. It caused widespread damage and injured more than 1,000 people. Now though, scientists say there could be many more space rocks like this one on a collision course with the Earth. An international team looked at the last 20 years of data collected from sensors used by the US government and infrasound sensors positioned around the globe. These detectors are in place to detect the threat of nuclear weapons, but they can also capture the blasts caused by asteroid impacts. The researchers found that during this time about 60 asteroids up to 20m in size had smashed into the Earth's atmosphere: far more than was previously thought Most went undetected because they exploded over the ocean or in very remote areas. Prof Brown explained: "We were able to capture the occurrence rate you would expect of things like Chelyabinsk and smaller impacts. When you compare that to the numbers you get from telescopic [observations], our numbers are several times higher." This suggests that the risk from asteroids of this scale has been underestimated. The team estimates that the strike rate of asteroids that are tens of metres in size is between two and 10 times higher than was previously thought. "Something like Chelyabinsk, you would only expect every 150 years on the basis of the telescopic information. But when you look at our data and extrapolate from that, we see that these things seem to be happening every 30 years or so," said Prof Brown. An event such as the Tunguska impact in 1908, where an asteroid flattened thousands of square kilometres of forest in Siberia, would probably happen every few hundred years rather than every few thousand years, he added. Prof Brown said more effort should be made to create early warning systems. "There are literally millions of objects in the tens-of-metres-of-size range that we suspect are near Earth asteroids, that can get close to the Earth," he said. "We have only discovered over 1,000 of these. There are many more of these to find, but it would be very expensive to find all of these and it probably wouldn't make a lot of sense because the atmosphere largely stops them. "But what might make sense are systems that find something a few days or weeks before they hit... to tell you where on the Earth and when they will hit. That would allow some warning to be given to the civil defence authorities." In another study, also published in Nature, scientists believe they have traced the asteroid that the Chelyabinsk meteor splintered off from. They think it is a fragment of a 2km-wide rock called asteroid 86039. Professor Jiri Borovicka, from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, said the orbits were "conspicuously similar", although the team could not prove "the common origin with absolute certainty".

      <title>Arafat 'may have been poisoned'</title>
      <description>Late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with radioactive polonium, says a Swiss forensic report obtained by al-Jazeera.</description>

      <body>The late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with radioactive polonium, says a Swiss forensic report obtained by al-Jazeera. Arafat's official medical records say he died in 2004 from a stroke resulting from a blood disorder. But his body was exhumed last year amid continuing claims he was murdered. The Swiss report said tests on the body showed "unexpected high activity" of polonium, which "moderately" supported the poisoning theory. Many Palestinians have long believed that Israel poisoned Arafat. There have also been allegations that he had Aids or cancer. Israel has consistently denied any involvement. A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said the Swiss investigation was "more soap opera than science". The scientists - from the Vaudois University Hospital Centre (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland - carried out a detailed examination of Arafat's medical records, samples taken from his remains and items he had taken into the hospital in Paris where he died in 2004. The biological materials included pieces of Mr Arafat's bones and soil samples from around his corpse. The scientists concluded that their results "moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210". The scientists stressed that they had been unable to reach a more definitive conclusion because of the time that had lapsed since Arafat's death, the limited samples available and the confused "chain of custody" of some of the specimens. Polonium-210 is a highly radioactive substance. It is found naturally in low doses in food and in the body, but can be fatal if ingested in high doses. The scientists have made "a pretty strong statement", according to Prof Paddy Regan, an expert in radiation detection and measurement at the University of Surrey in the UK, who was not involved in the investigation. "They are saying the hypothesis that Arafat was poisoned with polonium-210 is valid and has not been disproven by the data. However they cannot say definitively that he was murdered." Prof Regan says a series of assumptions would have been made in order to ascertain how much Po-210 may or may not have been in Mr Arafat's body at the time of his death. Po-210 has a short half-life of about 138 days. Prof Regan said measuring the tiny fraction left and extrapolating it back to the time of Arafat's death was like a blind man holding the tail of an elephant and using the information to work out the size of the animal. The second problem, he said, was that Po-210 occurs naturally in the environment. However, an indicator that the polonium may be synthetic is if there was far less Pb-210 (lead-210) in the samples. The professor highlighted results from two samples - the shroud under the corpse of Mr Arafat and urine samples taken from his underwear - both showed high levels of Po-210 compared to Pb-210, possibly suggesting the presence of "additional" synthetic polonium. He noted however that most of the samples of polonium measured in the report were accompanied by activities from Pb-210. Parallel investigations are being carried out by French and Russian experts - one Russian official said last month that no traces of polonium had been found. Yigal Palmor of Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC: "This is more soap opera than science." He said the investigations had been commissioned by "interested parties" - Mr Arafat's widow and the Palestinian Authority - and had "never bothered" to look for some key data. "The other huge hole in the theory is the absence of all access to the French hospital where Arafat died and to Arafat's medical files," said Mr Palmor. "How can the cause of death be determined without the opinion of the doctors or the results of the medical tests they ran on the patient? "Israel doesn't feel concerned in the least." Speaking in Paris, Arafat's widow, Suha, said the Swiss results revealed "a real crime, a political assassination". "This has confirmed all our doubts. It is scientifically proved that he didn't die a natural death and we have scientific proof that this man was killed." Reuters said she did not name any suspects and acknowledged that her husband had had many enemies in his lifetime. Arafat, who led the Palestine Liberation Organisation for 35 years and became the first president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996, fell violently ill in October 2004 at his compound. Two weeks later he was flown to a French military hospital in Paris, where he died on 11 November 2004, aged 75. France began a murder inquiry in August 2012 after the Lausanne scientists, working with an al-Jazeera documentary crew, found traces of polonium-210 on Arafat's personal effects. His widow had objected to a post-mortem at the time of his death, but asked the Palestinian Authority to permit the exhumation "to reveal the truth". His remains were removed from his tomb in the West Bank city of Ramallah in November 2012 and reinterred the same day. Last month, the head of the Russian Federal Medico-Biological Agency, Vladimir Uiba, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Arafat "could not have been poisoned with polonium", saying that test carried out by Russian experts "found no traces of this substance". However, the agency later denied that Mr Uiba had made any official statement on the findings. The head of the Palestinian investigation team, Tawfiq Tirawi, confirmed on Tuesday that the Russian and Swiss reports had been delivered. The Palestinian team is reported to have handed over its findings on Saturday. </body>

      <title>Forbidden City rocks carried on ice</title>
      <description>The huge stones that make up China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says.</description>

      <body>Huge stones that make up parts of China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says. That's despite the fact that wheeled vehicles had been developed 3,000 years earlier. The colossal city was built in the 15th Century by workers at the start of the Ming dynasty. Writing in PNAS journal, the team says that wood-on-ice sliding was more reliable than using wheels. Using sledges on ice was much more expensive and needed more workers but it was deemed a safer method than mule-powered transport. Howard Stone, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, said that on his first tour of the Forbidden City, he and colleagues were curious about how some of the huge stones had been transported. "There's a story on a sign that comments about an ice pack, so we started to investigate it," he told BBC News. "The funny thing about that sign is if you go to the leading scholarship on the science and technology of China, they don't indicate this as far as we can tell. "Most scholarly work indicates that the Chinese had the wheel in 1500 BC and the conclusion from that was they didn't have any need for sledges dragged by man. The Forbidden City was built 3,000 years later, so you have a contradiction. "So our suggestion is somehow that they didn't recognise the use of the artificial ice paths to drag these large rock carvings." But when the team translated a 500-year-old document from the historical record, they found a mention of huge stone carvings transported on ice. They then made calculations looking at the friction of ice to see how plausible it would be to drag such large rocks over the short time period in winter, when it was cold enough to do so. Prof Stone said several hundred workers would have been needed to transport stones ranging from 100-300 tonnes. "If you look at the frictional characteristics of ice for the rocks of this size, we estimate that 300 people were needed for this kind of dragging," he explained. Advance planning was also vital, as water had to be laid out in the winter months so it could freeze along the 43-mile (70km) stretch from a quarry outside Beijing. "They would dig wells every kilometre, pour water on the road which would give it a very smooth surface, The ice can support a lot of weight, they were then able to drag these objects," said Prof Stone. Other researchers say they were already aware of the use of ice to transport marble stone, but it had never been published in academic literature. Sally Church, from the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge University, had noticed the use of this method of moving marble after translating a Chinese book in 2007 called Stories of the Forbidden City. It was written in 1962, but based on earlier sources. The text said: "Really huge stones were moved on a contraption called a 'dry ship' or 'land ship'. Large pieces of wood were put together into a raft-like object, and there were two of these. "In very cold weather they poured water onto the roads and let it freeze, then either they or animals would pull it along." Dr Church said that it was "certainly new" and interesting to look at this topic from an engineering perspective. "It is just a small fact that lies buried in the sources in the subject. I would compare it to something like our knowing that the Tower of London once kept elephants and other exotic animals in a sort of zoo," she told BBC News. </body>

      <title>One in five suns has habitable world</title>
      <description>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet. Using data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope, they argue that one in five stars like the Sun hosts an Earth-sized world located in the "habitable zone". This zone is the region around a star where temperatures allow for water - a key ingredient for life - to stay liquid at the surface. The researchers have published details in the journal PNAS. "What this means is, when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest Sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye," said co-author Erik Petigura, from the University of California, Berkeley. He added: "That is amazing." His UC Berkeley colleague Andrew Howard said the discovery showed that planets like our own were relatively common throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Last week, astronomers announced the discovery of an Earth-sized, rocky planet orbiting its star at a hundredth of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Temperatures on this world would reach between 2,000C and 2,800C, with much of the dayside molten, meaning there would be little chance for life here. But team members cautioned that even finding Earth-sized planets in the habitable - or "Goldilocks" - zones of their stars was no guarantee these worlds would be hospitable to life. "Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive," said another author, Geoff Marcy, professor of astronomy at Berkeley. But Prof Marcy added: "Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbour liquid water suitable for living organisms. "We don't know what range of planet types and their environments are suitable for life." Researchers had previously combed through some 42,000 stars and discovered 600 likely planets. Of these, 10 were both Earth-sized and located at a distance that was just right for liquid water to persist on the surface. However, the team then corrected for planets that might have been missed by software designed to sift through the Kepler data for planet signatures. This process involved introducing fake planets into the data. Accounting for these missed worlds, as well as the fact that only a small fraction of planets are oriented so that they cross in front of their host star as seen from Earth, the astronomers were able to estimate that 22% of all Sun-like stars in the Milky Way have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. "For Nasa, this number - that every fifth star has a planet somewhat like Earth - is really important, because successor missions to Kepler will try to take an actual picture of a planet, and the size of the telescope they have to build depends on how close the nearest Earth-size planets are," Andrew Howard said. "An abundance of planets orbiting nearby stars simplifies such follow-up missions." </body>

      <title>India launches spacecraft to Mars</title>
      <description>India has successfully launched a spacecraft to the Red Planet - with the aim of becoming the fourth space agency to reach Mars.</description>

      <body>India has successfully launched a spacecraft to the Red Planet - with the aim of becoming the fourth space agency to reach Mars. The Mars Orbiter Mission took off at 09:08 GMT from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the country's east coast. The head of India's space agency told the BBC the mission would demonstrate the technological capability to reach Mars orbit and carry out experiments. The spacecraft is set to travel for 300 days, reaching Mars orbit in 2014. If the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the US, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. In order for the MOM to embark on the right trajectory for its 300-day, 780-million km journey, it must carry out its final orbital burn by 30 November. Some observers are viewing the launch of the MOM, also known by the informal name of Mangalyaan (Mars-craft), as the latest salvo in a burgeoning space race between the Asian powers of India, China, Japan, South Korea and others. Prof Andrew Coates, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, told BBC News: "I think this mission really brings India to the table of international space exploration. Interplanetary exploration is certainly not trivial to do, and [India] has found some interesting scientific niches to make some measurements in." Those niche areas include searching for the signature of methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere, which has previously been detected from Martian orbit and telescopes on Earth. However, Nasa's Curiosity rover recently failed to find the gas in its measurements of atmospheric gases. CH4 has a short lifetime in the Martian atmosphere, meaning that some source on the Red Planet must replenish it. Intriguingly, some 95% of atmospheric methane on Earth is produced by microbes, which has led some to propose the possibility of a biosphere deep beneath the Martian surface. But the gas can be produced by geological processes too, most notably by volcanism. Definitive conclusions are likely to be elusive, but the spacecraft's Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) instrument will aim to make measurements and map any potential sources of methane "plumes". The spacecraft will also examine the rate of loss of atmospheric gases to outer space. This could provide insights into the planet's history; billions of years ago, the envelope of gases around Mars is thought to have been more substantial. At $72m (£45m), the mission is comparatively cheap, but some commentators have still questioned whether a country with one of the highest rankings for childhood malnutrition in the world should be spending millions on a mission to the Red Planet. In one sense, India was left in a quandary because of the failure of its most powerful launcher, the first choice to loft the MOM into orbit. It meant the country's space agency could no longer fire the satellite directly out of Earth's atmosphere. As a fuel-saving alternative, the spacecraft will circle Earth in an elliptical orbit for nearly a month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. The formal name for the route MOM will take to Mars is a "Hohmann Transfer Orbit". The spacecraft takes advantage of a favourable planetary alignment, carrying out six small engine burns over November to lift it to a higher orbit before a final burn sends it off on an interplanetary trajectory. The difficulty of visiting the Red Planet will not be lost on Indian officials; just under half the total attempts to reach Mars have succeeded. But Prof Coates said the planned mechanics for getting to Mars were on a sound footing, and that the probe stood a good chance as long as its engines fired correctly. Those who defend India's current direction in space exploration say the technological development required to mount this mission could indirectly benefit the country's other activities, including poverty reduction. Nisha Agrawal, chief executive of Oxfam in India, told the BBC: "India is home to poor people but it's also an emerging economy, it's a middle-income country, it's a member of the G20. What is hard for people to get their head around is that we are home to poverty but also a global power. "We are not really one country but two in one. And we need to do both things: contribute to global knowledge as well as take care of poor people at home." K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told the BBC's India Business Report: "Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: 'It is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society.' He added: "A great revolution has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme." Mr Radhakrishnan played down talk of a race between China and India in space, commenting: "We are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services." But a successful launch would allow India to surge ahead of regional rival China, at least in the exploration of Mars. China's Yinghuo-1 spacecraft was to have reached Martian orbit in late 2012. But it was piggybacked on the Russian Phobos Grunt spacecraft, which became stranded in low-Earth orbit shortly after launch in November 2011. The MOM was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to postpone lift-off. </body>

      <title>Prostate cancer test 'may save ops'</title>
      <description>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest.</description>

      <body>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest. Early data, presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference, suggests a genetic test can tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours. A big challenge in treating the cancer is knowing whether surgery to remove the gland is needed. Cancer charities said a successful test would be a "game-changer". Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK. There are more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed and 10,000 deaths each year. The decision to remove the prostate is based on an examination of a tumour sample under the microscope. However, the procedure has significant side-effects such as infertility, difficulty maintaining and keeping an erection and uncontrolled urinating. One of the researchers, Prof Dan Berney, from Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC: "We need a better test as we are over-treating many men; most will die with, not of, prostate cancer. "We need to discriminate between the aggressive forms and those that will grumble along and just need monitoring." The commercial test, developed by Myriad Genetics but independently assessed by Queen Mary University of London, looks at the activity level of genes inside a sample of the tumour. If 31 genes involved in controlling how cells divide are highly active, it indicates the cancer is aggressive. Prof Berney said such information could "substantially change" decisions made by doctors and patients but the costs were "huge" and it was certainly not going to be offered on the NHS in the next few years. "We need to validate it and we're not there yet, but it is the strongest test we've had so far," he added. Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: "Developing an effective test to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer could be a game-changer for those affected by the condition. "We urgently need to reach a point where we can focus resources on saving more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year, whilst sparing the many others who needn't have concerns. "The results of this study are certainly intriguing, and take us a step closer to the diagnostic process for prostate cancer that men deserve. We will watch with great interest developments in this area." Dr Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: "Being able to tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours would help us take a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment. "Understanding more about the nature of a patient's tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side-effects, whilst also meaning that those who do need treatment receive it rapidly." </body>

      <title>Warming gases reach record high</title>
      <description>New data from the World Meteorological Organization says that atmospheric levels of CO2 and methane have broken new records.</description>

      <body>The levels of gases in the atmosphere that drive global warming increased to a record high in 2012. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), atmospheric CO2 grew more rapidly last year than its average rise over the past decade. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide also broke previous records Thanks to carbon dioxide and these other gases, the WMO says the warming effect on our climate has increased by almost a third since 1990. The WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin measures concentrations in the atmosphere, not emissions on the ground. Carbon dioxide is the most important of the gases that they track, but only about half of the CO2 that's emitted by human activities remains in the atmosphere, with the rest being absorbed by the plants, trees, the land and the oceans. Since 1750, global average levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased to 141% of the pre-industrial concentration of 278 parts per million (ppm). According to the WMO there were 393.1ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2012, an increase of 2.2ppm over 2011. This was above the yearly average of 2.02ppm over the past decade. "The observations highlight yet again how heat-trapping gases from human activities have upset the natural balance of our atmosphere and are a major contribution to climate change," said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. "It is a worry. The more we delay action the bigger the risk we cannot stay under the 2 degree Celsius limit that countries have agreed," he said. While the daily measurement of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded the symbolic 400ppm mark in May this year, according to the WMO the global annual average CO2 concentration will cross this point in 2015 or 2016. Levels of methane also reached record highs in 2012 of 1,819 parts per billion. Concentrations have been increasing since 2007 after a period when they appeared to be levelling off. The WMO report says that it is not yet possible to attribute the methane increase to either human activities like cattle breeding and landfills or natural sources such as wetlands. They believe that the rising emissions come from the tropical and mid-latitude northern hemisphere and not from the Arctic, where methane from the melting of permafrost and hydrates has long been a concern. Emissions of nitrous oxide have also grown, with the atmospheric concentration in 2012 at 325.1 parts per billion, 120% above pre-industrial levels. Nitrous oxide gas, although its concentrations are tiny compared to CO2, is 298 times more warming and also plays a role in the destruction of the ozone layer. Recent research indicates that the rate of increase in emissions might be slowing down, but the gases can continue to concentrate in the atmosphere and exert a climate influence for hundreds if not thousands of years. Scientists believe that the new data indicates that global warming will be back with a vengeance, after a slowdown in the rate of temperature increases over the past 14 years. "The laws of physics and chemistry are not negotiable," said Michel Jarraud. "Greenhouse gases are what they are, the laws of physics show they can only contribute to warming the system, but parts of this heat may go in different places like the oceans for some periods of time," he said. This view was echoed by Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. "For the past decade or so the oceans have been sucking up this extra heat, meaning that surface temperatures have only increased slowly. "Don't expect this state of affairs to continue though, the extra heat will eventually come out and bite us, so expect strong warming over the coming decades." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Hinkley firm denies fuel claim</title>

      <body>The company building Britain's first nuclear power station in a generation has denied a suggestion that the new plant would use controversial MOX fuel. French state-owned utility EDF said the use of plutonium-based Mixed Oxide fuel was not under consideration for use at the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Under questioning by the Public Accounts Committee, Mark Higson from the Office for Nuclear Development, said MOX could be used. Mr Higson was speaking on 4 November. The OND chief executive told the committee that MOX fuel could be used "in power stations yet to be built. The EPR reactor at Hinkley, for example". MOX is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material. It often consists of plutonium along with uranium, from either natural, reprocessed or depleted sources. EDF, which wants to use French reactor technology backed by Chinese money at Hinkley, responded quickly to the statement, saying it was not correct and that using MOX was not even a consideration. In a statement, an EDF spokesman said: "We have not used MOX in any of our stations and have no plans to do so in the future in our existing stations or new nuclear stations." Mixed oxide fuel was contrived as a method of getting rid of Britain's stockpile of civil plutonium - the largest in the world - accumulated from years of reprocessing foreign and UK nuclear waste. But there is no active plan to dispose of the material, which is now seen as a terrorism target and a proliferation risk because it can be used to make nuclear bombs. Turning plutonium into MOX fuel was thought to be the answer. But the Sellafied MOX plant built to make it failed dramatically at a cost of £1.4bn and was closed in 2011. A planned new MOX facility has a price tag of between £5bn and £6bn to the taxpayer. But the business case is controversial. To the astonishment of MPs on the committee, Mr Higson explained: "The value of the fuel, we would expect to be less than the cost of operating and building the MOX plant." In other words, it would be done purely to dispose of the plutonium, with no certain market for the fuel. EDF says it won't use MOX and Horizon, the other major nuclear company hoping to build reactors in the UK, which is backed by the Japanese firm Hitachi, said it has no plans to use MOX either. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, commented: "MOX is a nuclear fuel invented by governments to address the embarrassing problem of what to do with separated plutonium. It is expensive, difficult to handle and increases maintenance and storage costs, so utilities will always be very reluctant to use MOX unless forced to do so." A spokesman for Decc said the government's preferred option for dealing with plutonium remained MOX, but it appeared to row back on the statement made to MPs. "Mr Higson's reference to Hinkley was merely by way of example. The EPR is capable of burning MOX fuel. Actual use of MOX in Hinkley or any other new build reactors would need to be subject to commercial negotiations with operators concerned. Such commercial negotiations are naturally some way off as the reactors have yet to be built." The spokesman added that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority was also looking at alternative options. Hinkley is already controversial. Peter Atherton of the city firm Liberum Capital called it "the most expensive power station in the world (excluding hydro schemes)". Criticism has focused on the government decision to allow EDF to charge £92.50 per Megawatt-hour (MWh), twice the current market rate for the electricity which, because it is index linked, would be nearer £121 per MWh by the time the plant opens. That could earn the French and Chinese state-owned firms up to £80bn over the life of the plant. A controversy over MOX fuel could be the last thing they need. </body>

      <title>Farming key to closing emissions gap</title>
      <description>A new study suggests that simple changes to agriculture could play a significant role in plans to cut global greenhouse emissions by 2020.</description>

      <body>Changing farming practices could play an important role in averting dangerous climate change says the UN. In their annual emissions report, they measure the difference between the pledges that countries have made to cut warming gases and the targets required to keep temperatures below 2C. On present trends there is likely to be an annual excess of 8 to 12 gigatonnes of these gases by 2020. Agriculture, they say, could make a significant difference to the gap. This is the fourth such report, compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) in conjunction with 44 scientific groups in 17 countries. It says the world needs to reduce total emissions to 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020 to keep the planet from going above the 2C target, agreed at a UN meeting in Cancun in 2010. But when all the pledges and plans made by countries are added together, they show an excess of between 8 and 12 gigatonnes per annum in seven years time, very similar to last year's report. To put it in context, 12 gigatonnes is about 80% of all the emissions coming from all the power plants in the world right now. The authors highlight a number of ways in which this gap can be closed, including tightening the rules for counting emissions and expanding the scope of pledges already made. They believe around half the gap could be closed in this way. But they say that simple changes in agriculture could cut emissions by four gigatonnes, about two thirds of the remaining difference. Emissions from farming, including nitrous oxide from applying fertiliser and CO2 from ploughing fields accounts for more than 10% of the global total right now. "The potential is enormous," said Dr Joseph Alcamo from the UN Environment Programme. "It's not with anything very exotic, it has to do with the way we apply fertilisers to our fields, it has to do with conservation tillage so you don't plough the fields very rigorously." Conservation tillage includes a number of methods including leaving the previous year's crop residues on the fields to help protect the soils. The UN cited the example of Argentina where 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided by a shift to conservation tillage that took place in the 1990s. They argue that not only would it curb global warming, it would help poor farmers as well. "You could take a big step down the pathway of sustainable agriculture," said Dr Alcamo, "You can unite ideas of sustainable agriculture for the whole world together with ideas of controlling emissions by 2020." The report highlighted a number of other measures that could bridge the looming gap including energy efficiency, greater emphasis on renewables and reform of fossil fuel subsidies. "A lot of these actions have been done not for climate mitigation but to further national and local interest," said Dr Alcamo. The study makes the point that if action on curbing greenhouse gases isn't taken in the short term, then the possibilities of getting emissions down in the future becomes much more difficult. "Remember 44 gigatonnes by 2020 just sets the stage for further cuts that will be needed," said Unep executive director Achim Steiner. "We need 40 gigatonnes by 2025, 35 gigatonnes by 2030 and 22 gigatonnes by 2050. "At the moment the trend is in the opposite direction, we are over 50 gigatonnes." Next week, delegates from all over the world will gather in Warsaw to continue negotiations on a new global climate agreement that is expected to be signed in 2015. According to Mr Steiner, the emissions gap report shows just how much needs to be done. "This report provides a very sobering perspective of where we are and still heading and quite how far- reaching the implications are of maintaining this trajectory." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>A scheme to combat flooding by surrendering land to the sea will be completed on Monday on the south coast. The £28m "managed realignment" at Medmerry in West Sussex has seen the building of 7km (four miles) of new sea walls up to 2km inland. By letting the waters in, the Environment Agency says the risk of flooding for hundreds of homes will be reduced. The surrendered land will become a wetland habitat for many species. The sea has long been a threatening presence on the flat land of the Manhood Peninsula that juts into the English channel on the coast between Portsmouth and Worthing. Caravan parks in Selsey and Bracklesham Bay have been flooded a number of times in recent years, as the shingle defences have yielded to the surging seas. Since 2011, the Environment Agency have been working on a plan that they believe curbs that threat. The project is billed as the country's largest ever coastal flood realignment scheme, but it has required the destruction of the existing sea wall at Medmerry and giving back to the sea some of the land nearest to the coast. "We have made a hole in the sea wall," the Environment Agency's flood and coastal risk manager, Andrew Gilham, told BBC News on a visit to the site. "But before doing that we've actually built 7km of new defences further inland from the coast. What we've been able to create here is an area that can absorb the energy of the waves and reduce the flood risk to people." Although the new walls are much closer to local communities, the Agency says homes are much better protected as a result, with the development able to withstand a once in a thousand year flood. The change is partly being forced on the Agency because of EU legislation that requires compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat through development. The Medmerry scheme makes up for the loss of similar conservation areas in and around the Solent. "It is not politically driven," said Mr Gilham. "But the benefit of creating the habitat here is not only to reduce flood risk in this area but also to reduce flood risk to communities in Portsmouth and Southampton. "If we weren't able create habitat here we wouldn't be be able to do those defences." The scale of the £28m development is enormous. Between the new earthen walls and the sea stand 183 hectares of land that the Agency says will rapidly become a saltwater marsh, with potentially huge benefits for wildlife in the area. It will be managed by the RSPB. "Even in construction, we're seeing lots of migratory birds using this area," said Andrew Gilham. "It is already starting to be used by the wildlife. It's a massive nature reserve and a massive opportunity on the south coast." Local people are hoping that letting the sea in will not only protect their homes but boost the local economy as well. Alan Chamberlain is the estate manager of the newly renamed Medmerry Park holiday village. His business, located next door to the new habitat, is actually below sea level. "In the past we have been very close to flooding, and now we've got a one-in-one-thousand-year protection, one of the best in the country actually," he told BBC News. "For us it's a win win, it will encourage visitors to the site, birdwatchers and those interested in nature." The new development is facing its first big test on the day it opens as it will see one of the highest tides of the year. But the Environment Agency are fully confident it will pass with flying colours. Medmerry is one of a number of managed realignment projects that the Environment Agency are involved in. Andrew Gilham says it's part of a new approach. "Rather than fighting it, we are working with nature," he explained. "It's an important change in approach, you can only keep building bigger and bigger defences for so long. We have to ask if we can make better use of public money. "Certainly the habitat we are creating here is important to the broader ecosystem and the broader economy of the country by encouraging people to visit remote areas." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>'Platypus-zilla' found in Australia</title>
      <description>Part of a giant platypus fossil, dubbed platypus-zilla, is unearthed in Australia, scientists report.</description>

      <body>Part of a giant platypus fossil has been unearthed in Queensland, Australia. Scientists have dubbed the beast "platypus-zilla" and believe it would have measured more than 1m long (3ft). Writing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the researchers say the creature lived between five and 15 million years ago. The discovery suggests the evolutionary back-story of today's platypus is more complicated than was thought. Prof Mike Archer, from the University of New South Wales, said: "Suddenly up pops 'playtpus-zilla' - this gigantic monstrosity that you would have been afraid to swim with. "It indicates there are branches in the platypus family tree that we hadn't suspected before." Today, all that survives of this platypus is a single fossilised tooth, which was unearthed in the Riversleigh fossil beds in northwest Queensland. Based on its size, the researchers have estimated that the new species (Obdurodon tharalkooschild) would have been at least twice as large as today's platypus. Bumps on its teeth and other fossil finds nearby suggest that the creature feasted on crustaceans, turtles, frogs and fish. Although the area where the molar was found is a desert, millions of years ago it would have been covered in forest. The researchers think the beast would have spent its time in and around freshwater ponds. Prof Archer said that with just one tooth, it was difficult to work out exactly what this species would have looked like. However other fossils suggest that it could have shared the same bizarre appearance as today's platypuses, with their duck-like bills, large webbed feet and poisonous spurs. But this would have been on a much larger scale. "I guess it probably would have looked like a platypus on steroids," said Prof Archer. Fossil platypus finds are in short supply, with just a few fragments found throughout the southern hemisphere. As a result, there are many gaps in our understanding of the creature's past. Prof Archer said: "We have been naively led to suspect that maybe it was just one lineage of strange animals bumbling its way through time and space at least for the last 60 million years. "The discovery of this new one was a bit of a shock to us. It was a wake-up call that the platypus's story, the more we know about it, is increasingly more complicated than we thought." The researchers are now hoping to find more platypus fossils in the same area to try to shed more light these enigmatic Australian animals. Follow Rebecca on Twitter </body>

      <title>Trees help at-risk species keep cool</title>
      <description>Dense tree canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study shows.</description>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70833000/jpg/_70833091_3935853244_026eb85aea_z.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Forests with dense canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study has shown. Researchers found plants that favoured cooler conditions fared better under dense canopies than in ones that were more open to the elements. They added that these conditions could be a "critical mechanism" in the conservation of forest plant diversity. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A team of international researchers, headed by scientists from Belgium, noted that previous studies had shown that "biological signals of recent global warming" had been increasing across an array of ecosystems. "Around the globe, climate warming is increasing the dominance of warm-adapted species - a process described as 'thermophilisation'," they observed. The team gathered data from vegetation survey from more than 1,400 plots in temperate forests across North America and Europe. In each plot, they compared the results from an original survey with a repeated survey that was, on average, carried out 34.5 years later. The results showed that there had been a sizeable turnover, with about one-third of the species present in the original survey being replaced by other plants. Shaded sanctuary However, they also found that the thermophilisation of vegetation was lowest in forests where canopies had become denser. "These results suggest that recent forest canopy closure in northern hemisphere temperate forests has buffered the impacts of macroclimate warming on ground-layer plant communities, thus slowing changes in community composition," they wrote. As well as lowering temperatures, the dense canopy cover also increased relative air humidity and shade within forests' understorey. The researchers explained that these conditions also offered protection to forest herbs and tree seedlings from summer drought, "decreasing mortality and thus buffering the impacts of large-scale climate change". They noted that in western Europe, a number of factors - such as changes to management regimes - had resulted in increased tree growth and forest densities. "Logging and natural losses of tree biomass have been consistently lower than annual growth increments, resulting in an almost doubling of standing stocks of trees per hectare between 1950 and 2000," they wrote. Temperate forests account for about 16% of the world's tree cover, while understorey plants account for 80% of the flora diversity found in these habitats. Co-author Keith Kirby, a woodland ecologist from the University of Oxford's Department of Plant Sciences, said the microclimate created by a dense forest canopy allowed some plants to remain within their comfort zone. However, he warned: "The other thing we must remember is that this moderating characteristic only works as long as you have got the canopy there. "At some stage, the trees themselves may die from disease, they may get felled or they themselves might succumb to the effects of climate change. "Once that happens, what we might then see is that the ground flora might start to shift quite rapidly, so we might have things keeping relatively stable for quite a while but then we pass a tipping point once the canopy opens up." After a prolonged post-war hiatus, traditional woodland management techniques - such as coppicing - are becoming popular once again. But Dr Kirby told BBC News that this study's findings suggested that a more considered approach might be needed. He observed: "This might be a case to say hold on a minute because if we start coppicing and opening up the canopies, we will also be exposing these plants to future climate change more. "Maybe in the future we should be reducing the extent that we break up canopies." But he added that perhaps "the gentle intervention" of management techniques was needed in order to strengthen woodlands' resilience to the threats posed by pests, pathogens and extreme weather events. </body>

      <body>Two orphaned otter cubs are being cared for by the Scottish SPCA after being found in distress at Thurso beach in Caithness. The 10-week-old males were spotted by a member of the public. They were scared off by two dogs and were eventually found hiding under a wheelie bin in a nearby garden. Scottish SPCA senior inspector Audrey Gunn managed to trap the pair. They are receiving care at the charity's rescue centre in Clackmannanshire. The cubs, found on 26 October, have been named Thurso and Surf. Ms Gunn said: "Thurso and Surf were timid but curious and I paid a visit to the local fish shop to make sure they were well fed. "They were lucky to be found as otters are dependant on their mothers until they're around a year old and they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own." National Wildlife Rescue Centre manager Colin Seddon added: "Both cubs are well, albeit very frightened. However, they are clearly very happy to be together and they follow each other everywhere." </body>

      <title>Badger cull fails to meet target</title>
      <description>Some 940 badgers were killed in total during a pilot cull, which was lower than the planned target, the government admits.</description>

      <body>One of the badger cull pilot schemes failed to meet its target - even after a three-week extension, the government has admitted. The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were "designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers". "I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November," said Mr Paterson. "During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. "This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. "While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane." Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a "complete failure" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' "The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards," said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. "Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. "The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping." Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because "the badgers have moved the goalposts". "By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations," she said. "David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed." </body>

      <body>A wild boar which has been on the loose in Alderney for more than a month is thought to have swum there from the nearby French coast. The boar found its way into a pig farm on Friday but, when approached, escaped by jumping over a 1m (3ft) stock fence. Farm owner Tess Woodnutt said she would not have believed the animal could jump so high from a standing start, if she had not seen it with her own eyes. Islanders have dubbed the boar "ghost pig", as it has only been seen at dusk. Mrs Woodnutt said she first became aware of the boar on 27 September, when she was on holiday and received a call from a fellow islander saying one of their 40 pigs had escaped. Her son Jake immediately went to the farm and soon established no pigs were missing. Steve Shaw, who was Alderney harbour master for 25 years, said he did not believe it would be possible for a wild boar to get to the island by boat without the crew noticing, and he had never heard of a wild boar being found on any vessel. Some islanders have speculated the animal could be an "iron age pig", which have been farmed on the island. However, Alan Woodnutt, Tess's husband, said he was certain it was not. "Iron age pigs are a cross between a wild boar and a Tamworth," he said. "They look a bit like a wild boar but this animal was not the progeny of an iron age pig." Mrs Woodnutt said the boar's arrival on the island was a mystery but she had had it confirmed to her by an expert in the UK that a wild boar could swim long distances in open water. Wild boar are commonly found in Normandy, the coast of which lies seven miles (11km) to the east of Alderney. Duty Insp Kieran McGrath from Guernsey Police said islanders should contact them if they spotted the animal and should not approach it themselves, as any wild boar could be dangerous when cornered. </body>

      <body>By BBC camerawoman Rachel Price I have been a camerawoman for 10 years, but the chance to film a rocket going into space was a once in a lifetime opportunity. After a 22-hour journey to Baikonur in Kazakhstan, we had a 4am start. We were escorted into the cosmodrome, a collection of scruffy, space buildings in the desert. Then the hangar door opened, revealing the huge, red booster rockets looming in dark. The sun started to rise, and it was like a curtain had lifted, showing the incredible vast landscape of the desert steppe with the Space rocket crawling through it. Launch Day: We filmed the astronauts as they emerged in their spacesuits in the dark, holding the Olympic torch. They climbed onto the same bus that Yuri Gagarin used on the day he became the first man to launch into space. One minute to go Correspondent Daniel Sandford stepped in front of the main camera and we had one last rehearsal. This "piece to camera" had to be a "one-take wonder" with perfect timing. Blast off. I saw a huge amount of smoke and flames, but there was no sound. We were 1 km away. The rocket started to move. Boom! The sound had finally reached us, and Daniel started talking. I zoomed out to bring him into the picture. The rocket was moving fast out of shot so I panned up off Daniel, chasing the flaming rocket up into the blue sky. A perfect take. That was what we came for. In less than a minute, the rocket was just a burning speck. The torch, strapped inside the capsule on top of the rocket was heading out of the atmosphere. </body>

      <body>The 100th anniversary of the death of Alfred Russel Wallace, the "forgotten hero" who co-discovered evolution, is being marked today in London. The first ever statue of the naturalist will be unveiled at the Natural History Museum by Sir David Attenborough. A new wasp genus - Wallaceaphytis - has been named in honour of the man who has been in Darwin's shadow ever since they co-published their theory in 1858. The wasp was discovered in Borneo, where Wallace carried out his research. "It seemed only fitting to name it in his honour, especially as it is the centenary of his death," said Dr Andrew Polaszek of the NHM, one of the expedition team who found the insect last year. They have published their discovery in the Journal of Natural History - the same annals in which Wallace published his famous paper on the origin of species - "the Sarawak Law". Just one millimetre long, the wasp belongs to a group known as parasitoids, which lay their eggs inside other insects or spiders. "Wallaceaphytis is so unusual that one of my volunteers called me over to the microscope saying 'this looks really strange'," Dr Polaszek told the BBC. "Not only is it a new species but also a completely new genus. And we found it in Wallace's old stomping ground." The incredible variety of insects Wallace discovered during his travels in the Malay Archipelago inspired his theory of evolution by natural selection. He described his ideas in an essay which he sent to Charles Darwin - who subsequently sought to co-publish his own independent version of the theory. But while there are many, many monuments to Darwin, there has never been a single one of Wallace - until today. A life-size bronze sculpture by Anthony Smith will be unveiled at the NHM by Sir David Attenborough. "For me, there is no more admirable character in the history of science," said Attenborough of Wallace, in a special BBC audio slideshow charting the explorer's life and legacy. The new statue is the result of a fundraising campaign by the Wallace Memorial Fund, which is holding a special day of talks, Consensus, in London on 16 November. It depicts the moment when Wallace first glimpsed the male of the golden birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera croesus), on Bacan Island, Indonesia, in 1859. "The beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable," wrote Wallace in his book The Malay Archipelago. "On taking it out of my net and opening the glorious wings, my heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of immediate death. "I had a headache the rest of the day, so great was the excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very inadequate cause." </body>

      <body>I have been a camerawoman for 10 years, but the chance to film a rocket going into space was a once in a lifetime opportunity. After a 22-hour journey to Baikonur in Kazakhstan, we had a 4am start. We were escorted into the cosmodrome, a collection of scruffy, space buildings in the desert. Then the hangar door opened, revealing the huge, red booster rockets looming in dark. The sun started to rise, and it was like a curtain had lifted, showing the incredible vast landscape of the desert steppe with the Space rocket crawling through it. We filmed the astronauts as they emerged in their spacesuits in the dark, holding the Olympic torch. They climbed onto the same bus that Yuri Gagarin used on the day he became the first man to launch into space. Then, with every cameraman looking for the perfect spot, there was a last dash to the platform overlooking the launch pad. The Soyuz rocket stood glistening in the sunrise. Fifteen minutes before launch, I had two cameras set up. One for the live position and my main camera for our correspondent. One minute to go Daniel Sandford stepped in front of the main camera and we had one last rehearsal. This "piece to camera" had to be a "one-take wonder" with perfect timing. Blast off. I saw a huge amount of smoke and flames, but there was no sound. We were 1 km away. The rocket started to move. Boom! The sound had finally reached us, and Daniel started talking. I zoomed out to bring him into the picture. The rocket was moving fast out of shot so I panned up off Daniel, chasing the flaming rocket up into the blue sky. A perfect take. That was what we came for. In less than a minute, the rocket was just a burning speck. The torch, strapped inside the capsule on top of the rocket was heading out of the atmosphere. </body>

      <title>Culling badgers? Call the 'paras'</title>
      <description>Can badger cull extensions do anything to help tackle TB?</description>

      <body>Fresh from leading his very own dessert campaign, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is now doing his bit for "iconic species". And no, I don't mean badgers. Mr Paterson is visiting Kenya this week where he will announce that British Army paratroopers will provide training for local wildlife rangers in their fight against poaching. "Illegal poaching is having a devastating effect on some of the world's most iconic species and we must work together to tackle it," Mr Paterson said ahead of his visit. But perhaps the training and guidance that the paratroopers will be providing, could also be put to good effect back home? As well as details of Mr Paterson's safari to save endangered species, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published his latest written ministerial statement on the badger cull taking place in Gloucestershire and West Somerset. You'll recall that in both pilot areas, the culling companies were forced to apply to Natural England for extra time to meet the 70% target stipulated in their licences. In West Somerset the natural born cullers were authorised to kill an extra 165 badgers in the three weeks of added time. They managed to shoot an extra 90. So instead of the 70% needed to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle, the men of the night managed to get to 65%. Perhaps with some of that paratrooper training, they would have hit the target? Or maybe those dastardly poachers could be persuaded to visit West Somerset and Gloucestershire? According to Mr Paterson, the failure to hit the magic number doesn't really matter. For this is but year one of a grand four-year plan. This is not to be confused with those old Soviet five-year plans where the harvests were always abundant, and the workers were always smiling. In his statement, Mr Paterson said the advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer "was that a further increase in the number of badgers culled after the initial six-week period would improve the disease control benefits achieved even further and enable them to accrue earlier. "With the further removal of badgers seen," Mr Paterson went on, "the extension has been successful in meeting this aim." So even if they had shot just one extra badger, would that also improve the disease control benefits? I'm getting a sense that goalposts might once again be in motion. Because just a year ago, when he was explaining to the House of Commons why the badger cull should be postponed, Mr Paterson was at pains to say that getting to this magic number was crucial to the success of the trial. "It would be wrong to go ahead if those on the ground cannot be confident of removing at least 70% of the populations," he said at the time. There's an old adage in boxing, that tactical plans go out the window when you get the first punch on the nose. It would appear that Mr Paterson's hooter has been shipping a few blows.

      <body>Colombia's Constitutional Court will decide on Thursday whether to reopen Bogota's famous bullfighting ring. In the lead up to the decision, the issue has been raging on social media. Colombians love social media. Anyone who's anyone in the world of politics, sport or celebrity in Colombia uses Twitter. And bullfighting is one of the hottest issues at the moment, says Camilo Andres Garcia, a journalist, high-profile Twitter user and social media commentator in Bogota, who is opposed to bullfighting. It's the blood when the bull dies that many Colombians find hard to deal with. There has been enough human blood shed during the country's decades-long conflict, he says. Bullfighting is associated with the elite in Colombia - and conjures up images of rich ranch owners and women in hats and fancy dresses. There are many high profile supporters of bullfighters - including a number of Colombian newspapers - but on social media, they appear to be losing the PR battle. There are two rival hashtags doing the rounds on Twitter in Colombia ahead of this court decision, #LasCorridasNOVuelvenABogota - bullfighting won't return to Bogota - and #VuelvenlosTorosaBogota - the bulls are coming back to Bogota. The anti-crowd's voice is far louder though (12,000 tweets on their hashtag, versus fewer than 200 on the pro-side at the time of writing). "It's a very important decision for our family," says Diana Carolina Baquero Hernandez, a journalist and bullfighting radio host. Her family's history is bound up with Bogota's bullfighting ring, Plaza la Santamaria. Her father's uncle was once the manager, and many of her relatives were born and grew up inside the stadium. "Bullfighting is our life, our passion, our tradition," she says. Baquero-Hernandez has set up a Facebook page in support of bullfighting, but it's small-scale, and she admits her side is being drowned out. She says many who criticise bullfighting are ill-informed. "I feel angry sometimes because I feel people don't understand the real meaning of bullfighting. Bullfighting is an art." Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <title>How the Mars mission helps India</title>
      <description>What a mission to Mars means for India</description>

      <body>India's launch of a small unmanned satellite to Mars is being described as a giant leap for its space programme. Science writer Pallava Bagla writes on what the mission means for India and the world. If all goes well and the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the United States, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. India's 1,350kg (2,976lb) robotic satellite which is undertaking the 10-month-long, over 200-million-kilometre journey to Mars is equipped with five instruments. They include a sensor to track methane or marsh gas - a possible sign of life - on Mars, a colour camera for taking pictures, and a thermal imaging spectrometer to map the surface and mineral wealth of the planet. The mission will also analyse the thin Martian atmosphere. After India's successful unmanned Chandrayaan mission to the Moon in 2008 that brought back the first clinching evidence of the presence of water there, the Mars mission, according to K Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), is a "natural progression". More than 500 scientists from the Bangalore-based Isro worked round the clock on this $73m (£45m) mission, which was announced by PM Manmohan Singh in August last year. Project chief Subbiah Arunan says he has not taken a vacation in the last 15 months, sleeping at Isro's satellite centre in Bangalore and going home for "about one or two hours every day". So does India's Mars mission mark the beginning of a new Asian space race? India sees the Mars mission as an opportunity to beat its regional rival China in reaching the planet, especially after a Russian mission carrying the first Chinese satellite to Mars failed in November 2011. Japan also failed in a similar effort in 1998. China has beaten India in space in almost every aspect so far: it has rockets that can lift four times more weight than India's, and in 2003, successfully launched its first human space flight which India has not yet embarked on. China launched its maiden mission to the Moon in 2007, ahead of India. So if India's mission succeeds, it will have something to feel proud about. "National pride is important. If the Mars mission succeeds, it will be a big morale booster for India. We are not in a space race," says SK Shivakumar, director of Isro's Bangalore-based satellite centre. The risks can be high in a space race. Since 1960 about 40 missions to Mars have been launched, more than half of which have failed. And no nation - apart from Mars Express, Europe's maiden venture to Mars representing 20 countries - has succeeded in its maiden venture. Though India says its Mars mission is the cheapest inter-planetary mission ever to have been undertaken in half a century of space exploration, some are questioning its scientific purpose. "This is a highly suboptimal mission with limited scientific objectives," says D Raghunandan of Delhi Science Forum, a think tank. Others like economist-activist Jean Dreze have said the mission "seems to be part of the Indian elite's delusional quest for superpower status". Rejecting such talk, a top government official says: "We have heard these arguments since the 1960s, about India being a poor country not needing or affording a space programme. "If we can't dare to dream big it would leave us as hewers of wood and drawers of water! India is today too big to be just living on the fringes of high technology."

He calls the principle Note by Note cuisine and says it is like a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing note by note. The result is food not as we know it, more like being given a chemistry set on your plate.

      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <body>India is preparing to send a robotic spacecraft into orbit around Mars - a first for the country. Yogita Limaye from the BBC's India Business Report spoke to K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) - the country's space agency - about his hopes for the mission. A: Essentially in this Mars mission, which we are planning, the prime objective is to demonstrate India's capability to capture the Martian orbit and then to conduct a few meaningful scientific experiments. A: See, essentially when we talk about Mars and exploration of Mars, you look at life as one of those goals. So (we look for) the presence of methane in the Martian environment and see whether this methane, if it is there, has a biological origin or a geological origin. We also would like to study the Martian atmosphere and the escape processes there. A: No, see Curiosity is measuring the presence of methane in a small area where it is there today. We are talking about the entire Martian environment. So Curiosity saying "no" is not a point to be worried about. A: Any mission to Mars has to be done in an opportune window and the imminent window is November 2013, that is we need to get out of this sphere of influence of earth by 30 November to ensure that we have the minimum distance between Earth and Mars. Now we are launching this Mars orbiter from Sriharikota in the east coast of India in the first week of November and then the PSLV-XL (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) is used for the launch which will put this orbiter into an elliptical orbit around the Earth... then around the last week of November, we have a crucial operation, it's called the "trans-Martian injection" where the spacecraft is directed towards Mars. Then it is a long voyage of 300 days where the orbiter spacecraft passes through the sphere of influence of the Earth... Then it goes through a long phase of heliocentric flight where the orbiter spacecraft will be influenced not only by the Sun but by the other planets too. Then as it approaches Mars... we have another major action: capturing the orbit of Mars, which is on 21st of September 2014. A: Soon after the orbiter is put into the orbit of Mars, we would start the experimentation and even before this orbiter reaches the Martian environment we would be calibrating these instruments as it travels from Earth to Mars. But the most important part of it is looking at the distances involved. It takes at least 20 minutes for any signal to come from the Mars orbiter to Earth in some phases. It could be anything between four to 20 minutes one-way. A: Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: "it is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society." And in this area, India has become a role model for the whole world. Let me talk in terms of numbers. We spend in India about a billion dollars for the space programme. If we look at the central government expenditure, we spend 0.34% of its budget for the space programme. This goes primarily for building satellites in communications and remote sensing and navigation for space applications. Nearly 35% of it goes on launch vehicle development and about 7-8% goes on the science and exploration programme. So the Mars mission we're talking about today is part of that 8% of the 0.34% of Indian central government expenditure. And if you look at the benefit that the country has accrued over the years, it has surpassed the money that has been spent in terms of tangible and intangible benefits. [This can be expressed in terms of] the advantage that the people have got, the fishermen have got, the farmers have got, the government bodies have got for informed decision-making, the support the country has got for disaster management and by providing a communication infrastructure for this country using the INSAT satellites. Today we have nearly 10 communication satellites and 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. This is a great revolution that has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme. A: See, Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter, but Chandrayaan-2 as you said looks at the surface of the Moon using a rover and a landing module there. In 2009-2010, we planned this as a joint mission where India was to provide the launch and the orbiter and Russia was to provide the lander and the rover. Over these years there has been a programmatic realignment on this and, as of now, the plan is that the rover will be made by India and the lander will also be developed by India, and we must have this lander developed by the year 2016. Now, we also require a reliable GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket) for launching Chandrayaan-2. In December 2013, we are going to launch the GSLV T5 rocket with our own cryogenic engine stage. If that is successful, and we are able to have one more successful flight of the GSLV, then we would be ready - from the launch angle - for Chandrayaan-2. So, this is the scenario emerging and there will be scientific experiments in the lander module and in the rover, and a few in the orbiter too. Yes, 2016 is the correct target and the limiting factor for that is the development of the lander module. A: See, as of now we have no declared programme on human space flight, but in the year 2006-07 we began a study... and as of now we have taken up the critical new technologies that India needs to master a human space flight. The core module development, environment control and life support systems, the crew escape system, these are all part of that and we are working on it at the moment. But we require a human-rated vehicle that is capable of taking the crew module into a lower orbit. So you need to have a reliable GSLV for a manned mission or a GSLV Mark 3 developed and then manned-rated. A: As of now, there is no timeline for a mission but we are working on the development of the critical technologies required for it. A: Let me first say each country has its own priorities and focus. Right from the beginning, right from the early sixties, India's focus has been on peaceful uses of outer space and space applications and there India is today a role model for the whole world. One can be proud of it. China has its own priorities and it is moving in that direction. So, we are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services. We need to do it more cost-effectively and deliver it to the target audience in the country, whether it is to the people or the government or other agencies in the country. So that has been the focus of the Indian space programme. This interview has been abridged for reasons of article length. </body>

      <description>BT Sport announces an exclusive three-year deal to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League football matches in the UK.</description>

      <body>BT Sport has announced an exclusive £897m three-year deal to broadcast live Champions League and Europa League football matches. The broadcaster has won the rights to show all 350 fixtures each season from 2015 after talks with European governing body Uefa. A BT spokesman said it had "shaken up the UK TV market" and would make some matches, including finals, free to air. The news is a major blow to Sky and ITV, which currently share the rights. While BT said it was the first time a single UK broadcaster had won the exclusive live rights to all matches from the two tournaments, Sky said the deal was "far in excess" of its own valuation. "I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Champions League and Europa League," said BT chief executive Gavin Patterson. ITV has been the free-to-air broadcaster of the Champions Leage since it launched in 1992. "We were not prepared to pay over the odds in the latest live rights round," read an ITV statement. "Viewers will be able to continue to watch both competitions free on ITV through to 2015 and we remain the home of live England football." The new contract, priced at £299m a season, is worth more than double the current arrangement, which could mean significantly more money for clubs in the two European competitions. Each of the 32 teams in the group phase of the Champions League currently receive a participation payment of around £7m and £396,000 for every match played in the group stages. The winners get more than £30m in total. As part of the deal, BT has said it will show at least one match involving each participating British team for free every season. "We are new to the market. The key for us is growing our broadband business. We are available on all platforms. If customers do not want to be BT broadband customers, they can pay for the service as well," Patterson told BBC News. John Petter, boss of the company's consumer division, added: "Today, to get the whole competition, you typically have to pay Sky £40 or so a month. The pricing is not being announced today, but I can say that this will be far more affordable than currently." However, Sky indicated its rival had paid much more than it was prepared to offer. "We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation," read a statement from Sky. "There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more. "Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering." BT launched its UK sports channels on 1 August 2013 in a challenge to the dominance of sports coverage on Sky. BT has already spent £738m over three years for the rights to show 38 live Premier League matches for the 2012-13 season, while Sky paid £2.3bn for 116 matches a season. Other events in the BT portfolio include the rights to Premiership Rugby and motorsports such as Moto GP and Nascar, as well as taking over ESPN's UK sports channels. Only last week, it said more than two million people had subscribed to its television sports channels since August and reported six month pre-tax profits of £948 million. For its part, Sky announced in October that record numbers had tuned into the start of the football season  - with an average audience of 1.55m compared with 1.29m last year. BBC News business correspondent Joe Lynam said: "Sky has achieved well over 10 million paying subscribers in the UK. The backbone of that success is well-presented live football coverage. "While Sky has seen off challenges from ITV Digital, ESPN and Setanta, BT is posing the most formidable challenge. "BT is already in almost every UK home with a telephone line and is also the largest broadband provider in the market. It isn't charging anything to show live Premier League football for existing broadband customers but will be charging for some Champion League games from 2015, although no pricing structure has been published. "Their aim of becoming the home of live football coverage in Britain takes a giant step forward with this announcement and might even have an impact on Sky shares when trading restarts on Monday." </body>

      <title>Star Wars auditions begin in Bristol</title>
      <description>Hundreds of people queue at a Bristol arts centre for the first in a series of open auditions for two lead roles in the next Star Wars film.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of people have been queuing at a Bristol arts centre since the early hours for open auditions for parts in the next Star Wars film. Producer Lucasfilm is seeking two actors for roles in the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII. The parts are for a "street smart" girl in her late teens and a "smart capable" man in his late teens or early 20s, according to the casting call. Further casting sessions will take place across the UK and Ireland. The auditions, taking place at Bristol's Arnolfini, saw many hopefuls queuing up in the rain from 04:30 GMT onwards. By 10:30 so many people had turned up organisers had to close the line. "This is something I grew up with and it's massive - it's a massive deal," said Ben Millier, from Frome in Somerset. "You can't not audition for this if you're in the age range, if you fit it, because it's just a big deal." Alex Rambo, a hopeful from Bristol, said if there was the "slightest chance - it's all worth it no matter how long you have to queue for". And Tom Millineux, who had also been queuing for several hours, said he "couldn't resist the temptation" despite his "absolute lack of acting experience". But there have been complaints the auditions have been a "complete shambles" with people being turned away after they were told casting had been closed for the day. "My son spent two hours travelling this morning, arrived at 10:30 - at 10:45 they shut the doors," Hayley Mogridge said. "He then waited in line a further two hours in the rain - he is now going to spend his student loan on a cheap hotel for the night to attempt round two." Anna Brown said: "Two young people I know set off to these auditions this morning but were turned away as there were too many people and the queue had been shut down. "Sorry but that is appalling. " Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios near London next spring, with the film due to be released in December 2015. The open auditions for a "major Hollywood movie" were first published on the Twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a "nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie". Lucasfilm has since confirmed the auditions are for the next Star Wars film. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the series, in October 2012 for £2.6bn ($4bn). Open auditions also begin this week in the US, according to an online notice. Casting directors will be visiting cities including Nashville and Chicago as well as accepting online applications. While it is unprecedented for lead parts in a franchise of this size to hold open auditions in this way, Star Wars has in the past given major roles to little-known actors through the traditional casting process. That dates back to the original trilogy, when the then unknown Mark Hamill won the role of Luke Skywalker. Other movies have successfully cast secondary actors and actresses through open auditions in the past, most notably some of the later Harry Potter films. Actress Dakota Blue Richards won the lead role of Lyra in The Golden Compass, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, through open casting. Director JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the new Star Wars movie, will not be attending the open auditions. Instead, those at the auditions, who must be over the age of 16 for the female role, and over 18 for the male role, will briefly meet members of the casting team of the film. Glasgow, Manchester, Dublin and London will host open auditions throughout November.

      <body>Glasgow is to host the 20th MTV Europe Music Awards (EMA) next year, it has been announced. The event will be held at the city's £125m Hydro Arena, which opened in October, and has a capacity of 13,000. Bruce Gillmer, from Viacom International Media Network (VIMN), confirmed the ceremony would be held in Glasgow for the first time. It follows discussions between MTV, Glasgow City Marketing Bureau and EventScotland. The MTV EMA was held in Edinburgh in 2003. This year's event is taking place in Amsterdam on Sunday, and will include performances by Miley Cyrus, Robin Thicke, Katy Perry, Snoop Dog and Kings of Leon. Mr Gillmer, executive vice president of talent, music programming and events for VIMN, said: "Each year, the MTV EMA is an amazing, multi-platform music experience for our audiences around the world, presented through a dynamic, talent-driven spectacle that only MTV can deliver. "As one of the world's great music cities, Glasgow is always a favourite with artists and the new SSE Hydro will provide the perfect backdrop for the MTV EMA in its 20th anniversary year. We're thrilled that the eyes of the music world will be on Glasgow next year." Councillor Gordon Matheson, leader of Glasgow City Council and chairman of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, said: "It has been our ambition as part of Glasgow's major events strategy to attract the MTV EMA for a number of years and I'm delighted that MTV has accepted the city's invitation. "Glasgow proved to be the ideal destination for MTV Crashes in 2010, when Diddy Dirty Money and a fantastic crowd showed MTV's global audience that Glasgow is a city that knows how to party. "Since then, we've been working to bring the world's greatest music event to Glasgow and I'm delighted we can today announce the next chapter in this exciting partnership. "Hosting an event of the magnitude and international reach of the MTV EMA reinforces Glasgow's enviable reputation as one of the world's leading music cities." Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop said: "2014 is going to be an incredible year for Scotland and it is fantastic news that the MTV EMA will be coming to Glasgow. "As a signature event on the Homecoming Scotland 2014 programme, we will welcome the world to the EMA and showcase Glasgow and Scotland to nearly 700 million households through MTV's global network of channels. "The awards are a highlight on the global music calendar and next year it is fitting that it should be held in Scotland, the perfect stage for events, in Glasgow's newest venue, the spectacular SSE Hydro." </body>

      <title>Barlow: X Factor losers 'do better'</title>
      <description>Gary Barlow says X Factor is "a game show" where many contestants would do better to come second or third.</description>

      <body>Gary Barlow says the X Factor is "a game show" where runners-up often "do better" than the winner. The Take That star was speaking after 16-year-old Tamera Foster, one of the favourites to win, found herself in the bottom two last week. Barlow told BBC Radio 4's Front Row: "I kind of hope she doesn't win. Because I think she'd be better as a second or third, moving forward into next year." The likes of One Direction and JLS have taken runner-up spots in prior series. Barlow said the second and third-placed contestants simply "don't have the pressure of being the winner". The singer is mentoring the "groups" category on the X Factor this year. Last Sunday, he voted to save his act Kingsland Road over Tamera after they ended up in the bottom two, but the other judges outnumbered him. Asked if he felt obliged to save his own acts, even if they were inferior, Barlow replied: "You've got to remember it's a game show". He continued: "You've got to stick with your category. You've spent a couple of months working alongside them. I didn't feel strongly enough that I would say, on this occasion. 'I'm going to vote for the other act.'" Barlow also said he was aware of the pressure the music industry put on X Factor winners to succeed - because, years before Take That's comeback, he was dropped suddenly by his record label after his second solo album flopped. "When you're hot in this industry, everybody wants to know you," said Barlow. "When you're not, it's like you've got leprosy. Nobody wants anything to do with you and it was a strange feeling, especially after seven or eight years of international success," he told presenter John Wilson. "What was most shocking for me, wasn't that it had happened, it was the speed in which it had happened. "One day you have a big record label, hundreds of people all fighting your corner. And literally with a phone call, that's gone. You've been dropped," he said. "It's a tricky phone call to take, that one," he added. The full interview will be broadcast on Front Row at 19:15 GMT on Friday, 8 November 2013. </body>

      <body>Listeners to BBC Radio 4 will have the chance to record the Shipping Forecast, or meet the presenters of the Today programme and Woman's Hour, as part of a Children in Need fund-raiser. An online auction, launched on Saturday Live on 9 November, will let audiences bid for more than 40 prizes. "We though we'd try something different this year at Radio 4," said the station's controller Gwyneth Williams. "Something for you, listeners, to find, join in, share or take away." Among the prizes will be the opportunity for listeners to attend a recording of The Archers; tickets to a UK test match, including tea with Jonathan 'Aggers' Agnew; and the chance to meet songwriter Rufus Wainwright as he records at the famous Maida Vale studios for a forthcoming edition of Mastertapes. Fans of the flagship current affairs show, Today, can win an early morning visit to join the production meeting, watch the show go out live and then have breakfast with its presenters. "This is a prize that involves getting up at 5am to join our team of journalists and presenters as we broadcast the day's news and current affairs to around seven million people, live on BBC Radio 4," said Jamie Angus, editor of Today. "You'll also have the pleasure of seeing some of the more disturbing early morning sights in Today's world including John Humphrys' cereal bowl. "Despite that, we anticipate a lot of interest and we look forward to welcoming the winner into the team for the day." Women's Hour and Just A Minute are among a host of popular shows, including long-running drama series The Archers, offering listeners the chance to sit in on a recording and meet the team.

"This is your Radio 4, open to you in all its richness in support of Children in Need," said Ms Williams. The auction will be accessible through the Radio 4 website and is run through eBay. It finishes at 2100 GMT on Sunday 17 November. </body>

      <title>Guardian to face MPs over NSA leaks</title>
      <description>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger is to be questioned by MPs over the newspaper's publication of leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden.</description>

      <body>Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger is to be questioned by MPs over the newspaper's publication of leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden. Mr Rusbridger will give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee next month, a Guardian spokesman confirmed. The Guardian has published information about how British and US spy agencies monitor communications. The decision to publish the leaks was criticised by the leaders of UK security services on Thursday. Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought asylum - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. MI6 chief Sir John Sawers warned the Intelligence and Security Committee earlier this week that "our adversaries were rubbing their hands with glee, al-Qaeda is lapping it up" in the wake of the Snowden revelations, adding: "The leaks from Snowden have been very damaging, they've put our operations at risk". The Guardian, though, has defended its decision to publish the information, saying that the paper's coverage of British and US surveillance had prompted "necessary debate". On Friday, a spokesman said: "Alan has been invited to give evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee and looks forward to appearing next month." Mr Sawers, along with the head of MI5 Andrew Parker and GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, were questioned by MPs in public after coming under pressure to be more open after the leaks by Mr Snowden revealed widespread spying by GCHQ and the US National Security Agency. Mr Parker argued that the security services defend, rather than undermine freedom, and pointed to 34 terror plots that had been disrupted by the security services since the terror attacks in London on 7 July 2005. News of Mr Rusbridger's appearance before the committee comes as Conservative MPs Julian Smith and Stephen Phillips called on him to clarify whether he had "acted on every security concern raised by government" over the news stories. They also asked him to confirm whether anyone at the Guardian had "directed, permitted, facilitated or acquiesced" in the transfer of the files obtained by Mr Snowden to anyone in the US or elsewhere. Mr Smith and Mr Phillips said Mr Rusbridger's response to a letter from 28 Tory MPs had failed to "acknowledge the devastating assessment of the damage done to the national security of the United Kingdom by the Guardian's reporting of the Snowden leaks", citing the evidence given by the security chiefs. They continued: "Secondly, it fails to address the question of whether you have acted on every security concern raised by government and whether the Government has felt that it had adequate time to respond to the matters which you have reported." </body>

      <title>Broadcaster John Cole dies aged 85</title>
      <description>Former BBC political editor John Cole has died aged 85, his family says</description>

      <body>Former BBC political editor John Cole has died aged 85. Cole was the BBC's chief reporter during the Thatcher era, and covered major stories including the miners' strike and the Brighton bombing. "While many people will remember John for his journalism and broadcasting, for us he was the most loving, funny and devoted husband, father and grandfather," his family said. Cole, who retired in 1992, died in his sleep at home in Surrey. He was surrounded by his family, who said: "We will miss him terribly." He is survived by his wife Madge, four sons - Donald, Patrick, David and Michael - and nine grandchildren, who acknowledged the "many memories of the tremendous happiness he has brought into our lives". Born in Belfast in 1927, he began his writing career at the local Belfast Telegraph at the age of just 17. He went on to work at both the Guardian and the Observer, before succeeding John Simpson to the role of political editor at the BBC in 1981. Current BBC political editor Nick Robinson tweeted: "Sad news. The man I learnt so much from, the BBC's former Political Editor John Cole, has died. He shaped the way all in my trade do our jobs." The BBC's Mark Simpson called him "a journalistic legend". With his incisive interview style and distinctive accent, Cole was immortalised by a Spitting Image puppet, cementing his status as a household name. He was presented with the Royal Television Society's Journalist of the Year award in 1991 and Bafta's Richard Dimbleby Award in 1993. Following mandatory retirement after the 1992 general election - having reached the age of 65 - he continued to work at the corporation on a freelance basis for many years. He also wrote a collection of political memoirs entitled As It Seemed To Me, and a novel, A Clouded Peace. BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said he had covered "an extraordinary era". "He was somebody who really brought it to life and who really knew what was going on behind the scenes," she told BBC News. "He was a hard-working journalist... always there at the right place and the right time." A spokesman for David Cameron said the prime minister was "deeply saddened by the news and sends his condolences to Mr Cole's family", adding that he had "contributed so much to British political life". Labour leader Ed Miliband tweeted that he "grew up watching John Cole". "He conveyed the drama and importance of politics," he added. "Many condolences to his family." The BBC's head of news, James Harding, said: "John was a loved and respected broadcaster, a journalist with his own unforgettable style and a commanding knowledge of his subject. "He embodied the qualities of a truly great journalist: integrity, curiosity and character. He will, I know, be sorely missed and fondly remembered across the BBC." He added: "Our thoughts are with his family". Fellow journalist David Aaronovitch tweeted: "Farewell John Cole. I worked with him for several years at the BBC and he was a lovely, wise (though engagingly irascible) man." The former Deputy Prime Minister Lord Heseltine said Cole's success involved a "great deal of charm". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's World at One, he said: "John became a national character. I think the accent was a great help, didn't do him any harm at all, everybody knew who he was. "I look back with great fondness to my relationship with him." </body>

      <title>M resurrected for Philomena appeal</title>
      <description>Film producer Harvey Weinstein has resurrected Judi Dench's M, as part of an appeal against a decision by US film censors to give Philomena an R rating.</description>

      <body>Dame Judi Dench has reprised her role as secret service boss M, as part of an appeal against US censors, who gave her new film a restrictive "R" rating. In a short video, the actress resurrects her Bond character and dispatches an agent to take on the Motion Picture Association of America. "Just when you thought I was dead," she says in the clip, broadcast on US TV. Philomena was rated R, meaning under-17s must be accompanied by an adult, for two instances of bad language. Its producer Harvey Weinstein, who has a history of battling MPAA decisions, explained his appeal against the rating in an interview on CBS This Morning. "Our research shows us that, especially down south and in the Midwest, the PG-13 rating is very important for adults," said Weinstein, responding to suggestions that Philomena is not a film targeted at children. "There's a certain group of people who do not want to go and see an R-rated movie. Usually they're church families, and I think this is a movie that church families would profit by seeing. I think they'll love the movie - it's very entertaining." The Stephen Frears drama, which stars Dame Judi and Steve Coogan, follows a true story about a Catholic woman's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption in Ireland decades earlier. 'Humour and joy' "There are two F-words in the movie - you're allowed one F," said Weinstein on CBS, explaining the MPAA's reason for the R-rating. "The movie is the gentlest, most wonderful true story, filled with humour and joy. They should just put PG-13 strong language [certificate] on this and make an exception." In the words of the MPAA: "A film's rating is not a judgement value, but rather an indication to parents that it contains elements strong enough to warrant careful consideration before allowing their children to view it. This instance is no different from any other film." Weinstein called the statement "absolutely wrong", and argued that the censors seemed to pick on his studio films "more than anybody else" - though some claim his protests are actually just a form of publicity. In 2012, the studio became embroiled in a row over bad language in the documentary Bully, while earlier this year the Weinstein Company was forced to add director Lee Daniels' name to new film The Butler, after the MPAA said there was already a 1916 short film of the same name. The Philomena appeal will take place next Wednesday, with a full version of the video - co-starring Coogan - set to premiere on comedy website Funny or Die. "With the blessing of Barbara Broccoli and the Bond team, M has returned from the dead to fight this battle," said Weinstein. The film is set to be released in New York and Los Angeles on 22 November before screening nationwide and is expected to be an awards contender. </body>

      <title>Sia gives Eminem money to LGBT cause</title>
      <description>Gay singer Sia donates proceeds from her Eminem collaboration Beautiful Pain to the Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center, after critics attacked his use of homophobic lyrics.</description>

      <body>Australian singer Sia will donate proceeds from her recent collaboration with Eminem, a track called Beautiful Pain, to the LA Gay and Lesbian Center. She recorded the duet for the rapper's new album, which features a series of homophobic slurs on the song Rap God. Sia, who identifies herself as "queer", said she was "anxious" after hearing the track. She eventually decided to give her fee to homeless LGBT youths after blogger Keo Nozari confronted her on Twitter. He criticised Eminem's "hate speech" as "wholly insensitive to human rights". Nozari, who later wrote about their Twitter discussion in a Huffington Post blog, cited Rap God's offensive lyrics - including the line "you fags think it's all a game" - and referenced recent incidents of bullying and suicide, before asking "How is this good for LGBT kids?" Sia, who had a UK number one last year as the vocalist on David Guetta's Titanium, initially defended Eminem. "I know personally that he is not homophobic, but a performance artist," she tweeted. "I would never work with someone I believed to be homophobic. I respect that he can be misinterpreted in the worst way by the ignorami, and that scares me, but I respect him as an artist and person." However, Nozari replied: "What happens behind the scenes is invisible to most. [There is an] argument to be made [that] what an artist expresses publicly in their work matters most." He continued: "Fortunately I'm a grown, confident man. But for vulnerable kids in our community these words affect them deeply." Sia's vocals and song-writing skills are currently in demand and she has recently penned tracks for Britney Spears, Rihanna and Katy Perry. Her track Elastic Heart, a collaboration with The Weeknd and Diplo, will also feature on the soundtrack to the forthcoming fantasy sequel The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. "I am queer, and love my queers, young and old," said Sia on Twitter. "I work with the Center and homeless LGBT kids, and when I heard Rap God I was very anxious." She attributed Eminem's homophobic lyrics to his character Slim Shady who "represents the worst and darkest bile of America", but she added she could "see how it can be unclear" for young people. Sia concluded that she would think about her discussion with Nozari. The Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center later confirmed on Twitter that the singer had decided to donate a portion of the proceeds from Beautiful Pain to it. Eminem was questioned about his use of homophobic phrases when interviewed by Rolling Stone this year, when he suggested he did not equate the words he used to homosexuality. Eminem said: "I think people know my personal stance on things and the personas that I create in my music." He continued: "And if someone doesn't understand that by now, I don't think there's anything I can do to change their mind about it." </body>

      <body>Helen Mirren and Billie Piper are going head to head for best actress at the London Evening Standard Theatre Awards. The pair were previously in competition at this year's Olivier Awards, where Dame Helen took the prize for her portrayal of the Queen in The Audience. Piper is nominated for her role in clinical drugs trial drama The Effect, which is also up for best play. Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rory Kinnear and Adrian Lester are in contention for best actor. Lester and Kinnear played Othello and Iago in the National Theatre production of Shakespeare's tragedy, while Ejiofor portrayed Congolese independence campaigner Patrice Lumumba in the Young Vic's A Season in the Congo. The best actress category also includes Kristin Scott Thomas for her part in a revival of Harold Pinter's Old Times; Linda Bassett, for her performance in Arnold Wesker's Roots; and Lesley Manville, for Ibsen's Ghosts. The winners will be announced at a ceremony, presented by Homeland star Damian Lewis, at the Savoy Hotel in London on 17 November. The past, present and future artistic directors of the National Theatre - Richard Eyre, Nicholas Hytner and Rufus Norris - compete against each other in the best director category. Current boss Sir Nicholas is up for Othello, the incoming Rufus Norris for his revival of James Baldwin's The Amen Corner, and Sir Richard (in charge from 1988 to 1997) for Ghosts at the Almeida. The fourth director on the shortlist is Lyndsey Turner, for Lucy Kirkwood's Chimerica. Chimerica, which earned a flood of five-star reviews when it opened at the Almeida and transferred to the Harold Pinter Theatre in the West End, is up for best play alongside Nick Dear's The Dark Earth and the Light Sky (also at the Almeida) and The Effect (National). Broadway hit The Book of Mormon, by South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, goes up against Tori Amos's The Light Princess and a revival of Stephen Sondheim's Merrily We Roll Along for best musical. This year's awards feature a new category for best musical performance, with Rosalie Craig (The Light Princess), Cynthia Erivo (The Color Purple) and Charlotte Wakefield (The Sound of Music) on the shortlist. As well as his best actor nomination, Kinnear is among the three contenders for most promising playwright for his debut drama, The Herd, at the Bush Theatre. He is up against Phoebe Waller-Bridge for her one-woman play, Fleabag, and Rachel De-lahay for Routes at the Royal Court. The outstanding newcomer category features Caoilfhionn Dunne (The Night Alive, Donmar Warehouse), Seth Numrich (Sweet Bird of Youth, Old Vic), Luke Thompson (A Midsummer Night's Dream, Shakespeare's Globe) and Olivia Vinall (Othello, National). The best design contenders are Bob Crowley (People, The Audience and Once), Es Devlin (Chimerica), and Tim Hatley and Peter Mumford (Ghosts). The award winners are decided by a panel of six theatre critics and the London Evening Standard's editor, Sarah Sands. "This shortlist is one of our strongest in years," Ms Sands said. "The West End is in rude health, established schemes such as NT Live have really come into their own, bringing theatre to a wider audience and inspiring others to come up with new ideas." </body>

      <title>Bookshops lash out at Amazon offer</title>
      <description>An initiative by Amazon to sell Kindle readers in independent bookshops is met with hostility among shop owners.</description>

      <body>Bookshop owners have hit back at an initiative by Amazon to sell its Kindle e-book reader in independent shops. The Amazon Source programme, launching first in the US, would let bookshops sell the devices and receive a small cut of e-book sales thereafter. But reaction has been hostile - one US bookseller described it as "inviting hungry foxes into the henhouse". Amazon said bookshops "should be striving to offer customers what they want". Announcing the initiative earlier this week the company said: "With Amazon Source, customers don't have to choose between e-books and their favourite neighbourhood bookstore - they can have both." However, it appeared bookshop owners were not convinced. New York-based publisher Melville House gathered opinions, and posted the frosty responses on its website. "Hmmm, let's see," wrote Carole Horne from Harvard Book Store in Massachusetts. "We sell Kindles for essentially no profit, the new Kindle customer is in our store where they can browse and discover books, the new Kindle customer can then check the price on Amazon and order the e-book. "We make a little on their e-book purchases, but then lose them as a customer completely after two years. Doesn't sound like such a great partnership to me." Staff at Skylight Books in California said it was "a Trojan Horse-style attempt to gain access to our customers". Amazon has not yet announced whether it has plans to extend the scheme to the UK. However, retailer Waterstones began selling the Kindle device in its stores earlier this year, despite managing director James Daunt previously describing Amazon as a "ruthless, money-making devil". Mr Daunt admitted that readers were migrating to digital platforms, but that it was beyond the company's capabilities to develop and manufacture its own device. But whether independent bookshops will welcome the same logic is as yet unclear. The resentment stateside was welcomed by Patrick Neale, president of the Booksellers Association and co-owner of Jaffe and Neale bookshop and cafe in Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire. "I was really pleased to see that American independent bookshops were saying no thanks," he told the BBC. "We've stopped and thought about it because we're business people. But you've got to draw a line in the sand somewhere - they are destroying the high street. "To do anything in collaboration would be wrong to our customers - it would be a very confusing message." He added that a more favourable e-book deal for bookshops would be directly with publishers, with various discussions of that nature currently taking place. Mr Neale's view was shared by Fran Crumpton, company manager at the Book Partnership, a group that helps independent bookshops set up online operations. She too believed most bookshops would be opposed to the deal. "Why should they be selling Amazon's products? That will then stop people using their bookshops - and we are losing so many. That's what many bookshops are thinking." Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>Disney fixes Star Wars release date</title>
      <description>The Walt Disney Company announces it will release the next Star Wars film on 18 December 2015 as it reports better-than-expected earnings.</description>

      <body>The Walt Disney Company has announced it will release the next Star Wars film on 18 December 2015. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, from creator George Lucas last year for $4bn (£2.6bn). It has committed to making at least three new films in the series, one of the most successful franchises ever. Disney announced the release date as it reported a better-than-expected 12% jump in net profit for the three months to 28 September. It made a net profit of $1.39bn during the quarter, up from $1.24bn during the same period last year. The company also reported that its net income for the financial year to 28 September jumped 8% from a year ago to $6.1bn. "We're extremely pleased with our results for Fiscal 2013, delivering record revenue, net income and earnings per share for the third year in a row," Robert Iger, chief executive of the firm, said in a statement. Disney's movie studio business saw a 7% jump in revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenues rose to $1.5bn during the period, helped mainly by the strong performance of Monsters University, which Disney said "partially offset" the weak showing of The Lone Ranger. However, operating income at Disney's cable network unit, which includes the ESPN sports channel, fell by 7% to $1.3bn in the last quarter, which the firm said was due to the timing of some ESPN affiliate fee revenues. </body>

      <body>Disco pioneer Giorgio Moroder says he was "moved" by his recent collaboration with Daft Punk. The French band invited Moroder, who created Donna Summer's Love To Love You Baby, to their studio and asked him to narrate the story of his life. His speech then became the basis of a song, Giorgio, on the band's number one album Random Access Memories. Talking to BBC 6 Music's Lauren Laverne, Moroder said he had no idea how they would use his vocal - and said he was "emotional" when he heard the finished track. He also revealed that he is in talks to make a TV show about his life with US cable network HBO. The whole interview can be downloaded from the BBC iPlayer . </body>

      <title>Johnny Depp cake in giant bake-off</title>
      <description>An amateur baker produces an "almost life-sized" Johnny Depp cake to star in an international competition.</description>

      <body>A woman has baked an "almost life-sized" Johnny Depp cake for a competition. Lara Clarke, an amateur baker from Brownhills, West Midlands, made the Pirates of the Caribbean-inspired creation for the Cake International competition in Birmingham. She said: "The judges are probably more used to seeing three-tier wedding cakes than giant Jack Sparrows." A competition spokesperson said entrants' creativity was "surprising". Ms Clarke, who is entering the 5ft 5in (1.65m) cake in the large decorative exhibit section of the competition, said she had only started baking two years ago. "All I'd really made before was some bog-standard banana cake in home economics," she said. "The first time I baked a decorated cake was for my mother-in-law's 25th wedding anniversary. I thought it was rubbish but everybody else seemed to like it." Since then, Ms Clarke has baked cakes for family and friends. Previous efforts have included a 4ft (1.2m) Grinch cake, a motorbike and a cake replica of her mother-in-law. Ms Clarke, who works for a bingo website, said she learned her skills from watching YouTube videos. The Johnny Depp cake is the first time she has attempted anything on such a large scale. "One of my friends was on the phone and said I should enter Cake International," she said. "At the time I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean. I was watching Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, and I thought he would make the perfect cake. "He wears all these different fabrics, so he has lots of different textures to him. "He's just shy of life-size because I was worried we wouldn't be able to get him out of the door. "It took me 90 hours to make. We live with my fiancé's parents and I think they will be pleased to get rid of it. "When my father-in-law first saw him, he leapt about 10ft in the air thinking we had burglars." Ms Clarke has hired a minibus to take Johnny to the competition. The results will be known on Sunday. She said: "The competition is like the Crufts of the baking world. People like Mary Berry will be there." A spokesperson for Cake International said: "There really is no limit to the talent and ingenuity of the competitors." </body>

      <title>US writer claims Dylan Thomas Prize</title>
      <description>American short story writer Claire Vaye Watkins is named as the winner of the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for new writers.</description>

      <body>American short story writer Claire Vaye Watkins has been named the 2013 winner of the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for new writers. Judges said she was an "exceptional" writer and described her collection Battleborn as "infectious". The California-born 29-year-old was one of seven writers aged under 30 shortlisted for the prize. The prize, based in Thomas's birthplace of Swansea, is one of the largest literary cash awards in the world. "It has been such an honour and a treat to be part of this," Ms Watkins said. "I'm grateful for every single reader I have. "It was not written for New York or London, it was written for people like you and Dylan, and anyone else that's been told their place doesn't matter." Ms Watkins was presented with her prize at a ceremony at the city's National Waterfront Museum. "Claire Vaye Watkins has some of Dylan Thomas's extraordinary skill in the short story form of giving you a perfect vision of a complete world and that's extraordinarily rare," said the chair of this year's judging panel, Hay Festival founder Peter Florence. Singer and broadcaster Cerys Matthews, also on the judging panel, added: "Battleborn just bubbles. She is such a natural writer. "The whole book is so infectious - it leaves you looking forward to what is coming next from this exceptional young author." The collection of short stories in Battleborn examines some of the myths of the American west, from how a man responds to finding a cache of letters and pills on the roadside, to sisters unable to comfort each other following their mother's suicide. "How exciting is it that in the year when Alice Munro is the greatest exponent of the modern short story by winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, that the Dylan Thomas Prize finds another truly remarkable short story writer in Claire Vaye Watkins?" said another judge, Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson. "At aged just 29 years old, she is truly gifted." Cultural historian Peter Stead, chair of the Dylan Thomas Prize, said this year's shortlist was the strongest it had ever had. "We admired all the books and in the adjudication we discussed them all at length. There were several books in contention but our choice of Battleborn was unanimous," he said. The judging panel considered three novels, two poetry collections, and two short story collections. Thursday's prizewinner announcement follows a week of events involving all seven shortlisted writers, known as the DylanED programme. It has seen them visit schools and universities across Wales to give readings and take part in creative writing workshops. Those taking part included the one Welsh writer on the shortlist, Jemma King. She was nominated for the prize for her collection of poems, The Shape of a Forest. </body>

      <body>The Goldfinch, the new novel from bestselling author Donna Tartt, has topped Amazon's list of the 100 best books of 2013. Editors at the online retailer said the story of a 14-year-old boy surviving in Manhattan after the death of his mother was "hands down" the team's top choice. "The Goldfinch is an emotionally trenchant masterpiece," said Sara Nelson, editorial director of books. Khaled Hosseini's And The Mountains Echoed was in second place. The saga, about a father in Kabul who gives his daughter to a wealthy man, follows the Afghan-American author's hit novels The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. "As a sweeping epic, family tale, it was best in show," said Nelson. The top choices on the list include fiction and non-fiction works, a collection of short stories, a young adult novel and an account of being held captive in Somalia. Tartt's number one novel is her first book since 2002's The Little Friend, which followed her much-loved 1992 debut, The Secret History. In third place on the list was Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist David Finkel's Thank You for Your Service, a non-fiction book about soldiers returning home from war. "Finkel gets inside the families of these guys that have come back after horrible, horrible experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan," said Nelson. Kate Atkinson's Life After Life and Tom Kizzia's Pilgrim's Wilderness: A True Story of Faith and Madness on the Alaska Frontier completed the top five. Amazon also voted on its favourite books by categories, with the full list available here. </body>

      <title>Theatre cuts 'equal to five jobs'</title>
      <description>Nottingham Playhouse bosses ask the county council to reconsider cuts that are "equivalent to five jobs".</description>

      <body>Nottingham Playhouse bosses have asked the county council to reconsider a proposed £94,000 reduction in funding. The theatre's chief executive Stephanie Sirr said the cuts are "the equivalent of around five jobs". The county council has proposed the deduction to help cope with its £154m budget deficit and government cuts over the next three years. The authority said it has tried to provide fairness but its priority is the vulnerable, young and the elderly. Ms Sirr said: "£94,000 pounds doesn't actually buy very many services, it doesn't make a huge difference to the county council but it makes a massive difference to Nottingham Playhouse. "It's the equivalent of around five jobs so we are asking them to reconsider and asking people to contact the county council." The Labour-led authority announced that 800 jobs could go and services would be cut over the next three years, due to the government's austerity programme. Councillor Joyce Bosnjak, deputy leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, said: "Inevitably, when deciding which services we can continue to deliver, this means we are faced with extremely stark choices. "We have to try to provide fairness in a difficult time and our priorities will be those in greatest need - the vulnerable young and older people. "We recognise that Nottingham Playhouse makes a valuable contribution to the area's economy and arts development. "However, it is located in the city of Nottingham, which is not under the jurisdiction of the county council. "None of the theatres which do fall into the county council's area receive any grant support from the council." Screenwriter William Ivory said he felt "ashamed" to come from Nottinghamshire, following the council's announcement. Mr Ivory, who has based much of his work in Nottinghamshire, including BBC One dramas Truckers and A Thing Called Love, tweeted: "For 20 years I've tried to show Notts off to the world: an artistic heartland to come film in. Maybe not. #costofeverythingvalueofnothing." </body>

      <title>Director Ramsay sued by producers</title>
      <description>The producers of a Western, starring Natalie Portman, take legal action against Scots director Lynne Ramsay, who quit the movie before filming began.</description>

      <body>The producers of Jane Got A Gun, a Western starring Natalie Portman, have taken legal action against Scots director Lynne Ramsay, who quit the movie a day before shooting. They said Ramsay was paid $750,000 (£466,000) to work on the screenplay and to direct but her last-minute departure delayed production. They also claimed she was drunk and abusive on set. Ramsay was followed off the troubled project by actor Michael Fassbender. Jude Law, who was brought in as a replacement, followed suit as did Bradley Cooper after him. Ewan McGregor was eventually brought in to star with Oscar-winner Portman, with Warrior filmmaker Gavin O'Connor signed on to direct. According to the film's synopsis, Portman plays the wife of an injured outlaw, who is forced to defend her farm from his former gang after they attempt to murder him. The court papers, acquired by the Hollywood Reporter and filed in a federal court in New Mexico - where the film was due to shoot, alleged Ramsay "was repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew and was generally disruptive". The legal action further alleged that Ramsey, who was Bafta-nominated for We Need To Talk About Kevin - starring Tilda Swinton, endangered crew members "when she pointed a prop gun directly at a camera and, in turn, at the camera crew before first taking proper precautions". Portman - who is also one of the film's producers - reportedly showed up for the first day of shooting in March unaware that Ramsay had quit the day before. According to a report in the Hollywood Reporter, the Scottish filmmaker had not been presented with an approved schedule, script or budget days before shooting was set to begin. Earlier this year, Ramsay served on the prize jury at the Cannes Film Festival alongside Stephen Spielberg and Nicole Kidman. </body>

      <body>Drinking glasses that were a gift from Hollywood legend Humphrey Bogart have sold for more than double their expected price. Bogart gave public relations man Bill Rowland Hill the six small and five large glasses for his help publicising the 1951 film The African Queen. They were sold for £8,000 to a private buyer from Europe at an art and antiques fair in London. It had been expected that they would sell for about £3,500. The glasses, which were engraved with the initials HB, were accompanied by a letter on 20th Century Fox-headed notepaper from Pinewood signed "Bogie". He thanks Mr Rowland Hill for his PR work and "all the other little things". The letter reads: "My Dear Bill. Before I leave for home I want to say, one big 'thank you' from the bottom of my heart for all you have done publicity wise both on the set, and in Africa. "I wanted to send you some Hootch but on second thoughts I want you to have something to put it in. "Will you call at that fancy store (Heal's) on Tottenham Court Street and see a guy called Gaylard. Choose yourself a dozen glasses from the suite I have had made. "Once again sport, thanks a million." Huston's World War 1 film, The African Queen, tells the story of American Rose Sayer - played by Katharine Hepburn - who escapes a village burned down in German East Africa on a boat owned by rough-and-ready Charlie Allnutt, played by Bogart. It won Bogart the best actor Oscar in 1952. The 11 glasses were being sold by antique glass dealers Mark J West, of Redhill, Surrey, at the 23rd Winter Fine Art and Antiques Fair at London Olympia. </body>

      <title>Star Wars movie to hold open casting</title>
      <description>Unprecedented open casting sessions are to be held for Star Wars: Episode VII around the UK and Ireland in November, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Open auditions are being planned for two lead roles in the next Star Wars film, the BBC has learned. The casting sessions for Star Wars: Episode VII will start later this week at locations around the UK and Ireland, including London, Dublin and Glasgow. According to a casting notice the film-makers are looking to fill two roles. They are a "street smart and strong" orphaned girl in her late teens and a "smart capable" man in his late teens or early 20s. The open auditions for a "major Hollywood Movie" were first published on the twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a "nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie". Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series, in October 2012. In the US open auditions also begin this week according to an online notice. Casting directors will be visiting cities including Nashville and Chicago as well as accepting online applications. Lucasfilm declined to comment to the BBC but it is likely the characters have been given non sci-fi names and descriptions in the announcement in an effort to disguise the auditions are for Star Wars: Episode VII. The broad nature of the characters is almost the same as in descriptions leaked online earlier in the year when the overall casting process began. While it is unprecedented for lead parts in a franchise of this size to hold open auditions in this way, Star Wars has in the past given major roles to little known actors and actresses through the traditional casting process, dating back to the original trilogy when the then unknown Mark Hamill won the role of Luke Skywalker. Other movies have successfully cast secondary actors and actresses through open auditions in the past most notably some of the later Harry Potter films. And actress Dakota Blue Richards won the lead role of Lyra in The Golden Compass, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, through open casting. Director JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the movie, will not be attending the open auditions which begin in Bristol on 9 November. Instead those at the auditions, who must be over the age of 16 for the female role, and over 18 for the male role, will briefly meet members of the casting team of the film. Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios in spring 2014, for an expected 2015 release. </body>

      <title>Taiwan singer's flag display sparks row</title>

      <body>Taiwanese singer Deserts Chang could never have imagined that her small concert in Manchester last week would trigger a massive row on Chinese social media over cross-strait relations. At the concert held on Saturday at the University of Manchester, attended mainly by students from Taiwan and mainland China, Chang took a Taiwanese flag from a group of fans in the front row and unfurled it on stage. "I see there are also people who bring a national flag to the concert," the 32-year-old singer-songwriter said, adding "I have not felt so patriotic for a while... and I am from Taiwan." Chang was soon interrupted by a female Chinese student, who shouted in English: "There are students from mainland here. No politics today!" To which Chang replied, "It's not politics, it is just a flag that represents where I am from." It was a minor argument involving two people, and other Chinese students at the concert did not get involved. But when the incident was disclosed on the internet, it attracted massive interest and on Tuesday became one of the top trending topics on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Many online commentators accused Chang of openly declaring Taiwan's independence and being arrogant towards Chinese students in the audience. Some even told the singer to stay away from mainland China and leave the entertainment industry. "Please never come to the mainland and never release albums here," wrote Weibo user "Shen Xiaotang". China and Taiwan split in 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party overthrew the Republic of China (ROC) and founded the People's Republic on the mainland, forcing the ROC government to retreat to Taiwan. Many mainland Chinese support Beijing's claim that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and therefore find Chang's display of the Taiwanese flag unacceptable. But not all Chinese netizens share this sentiment. In fact, many have come to Chang's defence and have criticised her critics for over-reacting. "Some people have over-reacted again. Their sensitive nerves can only expose their fragility and sense of inferiority," said "April Zi". To some netizens, it is absurd to accuse Chang of being a separatist due to this incident, because the flag she showed at the concert used to be the national flag of China before 1949 and is not a symbol of Taiwan's pro-independence forces. Weibo user "Old Q" said: "Those who accuse Chang of supporting Taiwan independence have been brainwashed. You can afford to be ignorant, but you cannot afford to lack such basic common sense." As the online debate raged on, rumours began to circulate that Chang's career in China was in danger. According to major Chinese and Hong Kong entertainment media outlets, which have given extensive coverage to the incident, Chang's 30 December Beijing concert could be cancelled by the Chinese authorities. The Taiwanese government weighed in on Wednesday to try to minimise the damage to cross-strait relations. Wang Yu-chi, the head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said Chang had not done anything wrong and that he would be "pained" if her Beijing concert is cancelled simply because of the flag row. When asked about her take on the incident, a Chinese spokeswoman on cross-strait relations avoided discussing the possible cancellation of the concert. Talking to Taiwanese media, Fan Liqing, spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, simply said that Beijing hopes people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait could "enhance mutual understanding" and "work together for a Chinese renaissance".

      <title>Marvel TV shows to debut on Netflix</title>
      <description>Netflix has announced it will buy four new live-action TV series from Disney's Marvel</description>

      <body>Netflix has announced it will buy four new live-action TV series from comic book firm Marvel, bringing some lesser-known superheroes to the small screen. The film and TV streaming service has committed to four 13-episode series, based around the characters Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Iron Fist and Luke Cage. It marks a major investment by Netflix into original programming, following success stories such as House of Cards. Marvel said fans would be able to enjoy shows "how and when they want". Alan Fine, Marvel Entertainment president, called the deal "unparalleled". "Netflix offers an incredible platform for the kind of rich storytelling that is Marvel's speciality," he said in a statement. He said the series would expand "the narrative possibilities of on-demand television". As a streaming service, Netflix allows viewers to abandon scheduled programming, often making the entire series available to watch in one sitting. Comic book trend The four series - made by Marvel and Disney-owned ABC studios - will be streamed from 2015 onwards, culminating in a fifth mini-series uniting all four characters, called The Defenders. Comic book adaptations are enjoying a renaissance on US TV networks. Joss Whedon's Avengers spin-off, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D, premiered on ABC in September, achieving the highest ratings for a US drama debut in nearly four years - although viewing figures have subsequently dipped. The Fox television network has ordered Gotham, a Batman spin-off series based around police commissioner James Gordon, alongside adaptations of Unthinkable and Alan Moore's League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. And a Wonder Woman revival is also being considered by the CW network. There are also rumours of another Marvel spin-off series, based on Hayley Atwell's character in Captain America. Netflix's Ted Sarandos said it was "thrilled" to be working with Marvel "to take our brand of television to new levels". The service has grown massively in popularity over the past three years, providing access to hits such as Breaking Bad. Original drama includes Orange Is The New Black and a new series of Arrested Development. </body>

      <title>Clegg takes aim at 'sneering' Paxman</title>
      <description>Deputy PM Nick Clegg criticises BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman for spending "all his time sneering at politics" when he "lives off politics".</description>

      <body>Nick Clegg has criticised Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman's "sneering" attitude towards politicians. The deputy PM said the presenter made a living off politics but treated all politicians as "rogues and charlatans". His comments follow Paxman's admission that he did not vote at a recent election because he had found the parties "unappetising". The presenter also called the Lib Dem tuition fees U-turn "the most blatant lie in recent political history". Mr Clegg conceded politics was imperfect but asserted that "of course you should vote". The Lib Dem leader, appearing on his regular LBC radio phone-in, said that not voting in elections was a total "abdication of responsibility". On Newsnight last month, presenter Jeremy Paxman berated comedian Russell Brand, who has urged revolution and non-participation in elections, for not bothering to vote. But Paxman later admitted he did not vote in a recent election "because I thought the choice so unappetising". Mr Clegg said: "Here is a guy who gets paid a million pounds, thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers. He lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics. "We know that politics is not perfect, but at the end of the day it is the way that we decide how you pay your taxes, how we support our hospitals, our schools, whether we are going to war or not, how we deal with climate change." He continued: "Of course it's sometimes unedifying but this idea that you can sneer at the whole thing, dismiss everybody as somehow being rogues and charlatans and say, 'Well, therefore I'm going to wash my hands of the whole thing,' I think is a total abdication of responsibility. "I just have this old-fashioned view, if you want to improve something get stuck in and get your hands dirty and change it. "Don't somehow pretend you can turn your back on it." In the Newsnight interview with Paxman, Brand argued he had never voted because of "absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". At the time, Paxman responded by asking: "If you can't be arsed to vote, why should we be arsed to listen to your political point of view?" But Paxman later told the Radio Times he had some sympathy with Brand's position. "I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo chamber. But it is all we have," he said. On his decision not to vote, he said: "By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote - cannot even be bothered to write 'none of the above' on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all." On BBC Radio 4's PM, comedian Ken Dodd was asked what he thought of Brand's stance, replying: "It's stupid. To be able to vote is a great privilege. "It's a privilege granted to every citizen, and we are citizens of the greatest country in the world and therefore we must preserve that." </body>

      <description>Crime author PD James' top 10 tips for writing a novel</description>

      <body>Although she didn't publish her first novel until she was 42, Phyllis Dorothy James had been writing since childhood. Now a celebrated crime writer, she has penned more than 20 books, including The Children Of Men, and the Adam Dalgliesh mystery series. At the age of 93, she says she wants to write just one more detective novel. Here are her top 10 tips for being an author. You can't teach someone to know how to use words effectively and beautifully. You can help people who can write to write more effectively and you can probably teach people a lot of little tips for writing a novel, but I don't think somebody who cannot write and does not care for words can ever be made into a writer. It just is not possible. Nobody could make me into a musician. Somebody might be able to teach me how to play the piano reasonably well after a lot of effort, but they can't make a musician out of me and you cannot make a writer, I do feel that very profoundly. You absolutely should write about what you know. There are all sorts of small things that you should store up and use, nothing is lost to a writer. You have to learn to stand outside of yourself. All experience, whether it is painful or whether it is happy is somehow stored up and sooner or later it's used. I love situations where people are thrown together in unwelcome proximity. where all kinds of reprehensible emotions can bubble up. I think you must write what you feel you want to write because then the book is genuine and that comes through. I believe that someone who can write, who has a feeling for words and knows how to use them will find a publisher. Because after all, publishers do still need to find new writers. We all get old and we die and that's that and there have to be successors. I think all we writers are different. It's interesting, isn't it, how different we are? Some people have to have the room, the pen and others do everything on a computer. I write by hand and I can write more or less anywhere as long as I've got a comfortable chair, a table, an unlimited amount of biros to write with and lined paper to write on. And then the next day when my PA comes, which she does at 10 o'clock, then I've got quite a lot to dictate to her and she puts it on to the computer, prints it out and I do the first revision. In a sense, therefore, I revise as I go. It's important to get up early - before London really wakes and the telephone calls begin and the emails pile up. This is the best time for me, the time of quiet in the morning, Goodness gracious, how the world of publishing has changed! It is much easier now to produce a manuscript with all the modern technology. It is probably a greater advantage now, more than ever before, to have an agent between you and the publisher. Everything has changed and it's really quite astonishing, because people can self-publish now. I would once have thought that that was rather a self-defeating way of doing it but actually publishers do look at what is self-published and there are examples of people picking up very lucrative deals. To write well, I advise people to read widely. See how people who are successful and good get their results, but don't copy them. And then you've got to write! We learn to write by writing, not by just facing an empty page and dreaming of the wonderful success we are going to have. I don't think it matters much what you use as practice, it might be a short story, it might be the beginning of a novel, or it might just be something for the local magazine, but you must write and try and improve your writing all the time. Don't think about it or talk about it, get the words down. It is undoubtedly a lonely career, but I suspect that people who find it terribly lonely are not writers. I think if you are a writer you realise how valuable the time is when you are absolutely alone with your characters in complete peace. I think it is a necessary loneliness for most writers - they wouldn't want to be always in the middle of everything having a wonderful life. I've never felt lonely as a writer, not really, but I know people do. Something always sparks off a novel, of course. With me, it's always the setting. I think I have a strong response to what I think of as the 'spirit of a place'. I remember I was looking for an idea in East Anglia and standing on a very lonely stretch of beach. I shut my eyes and listened to the sound of the waves breaking over the pebble shore. Then I opened them and turned from looking at the dangerous and cold North Sea to look up and there, overshadowing this lonely stretch of beach was the great, empty, huge white outline of Sizewell nuclear power station. In that moment I knew I had a novel. It was called Devices and Desires. Never go anywhere without a notebook because you can see a face that will be exactly the right face for one of your characters, you can see place and think of the perfect words to describe it. I do that when I'm writing, I think it's a sensible thing for writers to do. I've written little bits of my next novel, things that have occurred to me. I've got the setting already. I've got the title, I've got most of the plot and I shall start some serious writing of it next month, I think. I never talk about a book before it is finished and I never show it to anybody until it is finished and I don't show it to anybody even then, except for my publisher and my agent. Then there is this awful time until they phone. I'm usually pretty confident by the time I've sent it in but I have those moments when I think, 'well I sent it to them on Friday, by Saturday night they should be ringing up to say how wonderful it is!' I'm always aware that people might have preferences and think that one book is better than another. I am lucky to have written as many books as I have, really, and it has been a joy. With old age, it becomes very difficult. It takes longer for the inspiration to come, but the thing about being a writer is that you need to write. What I am working on now will be another detective story, it does seem important to write one more. I think it is very important to know when to stop. Some writers, particularly of detective fiction, have published books that they should not have published. I don't think my publisher would let me do that and I don't think my children would like me to. I hope I would know myself whether a book was worth publishing. I think while I am alive, I shall write. There will be a time to stop writing but that will probably be when I come to a stop, too. </body>

      <title>Ken Dodd: Don't call me eccentric</title>
      <description>Ken Dodd gets serious about life, love and laughter</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24853191</url>

      <body>Ken Dodd is the last star comedian from the variety era. Now 86, he is still drawing crowds for his five-hour stage shows. Opening an exhibition about his career, he gets serious about life and laughter - and why he does not like being called eccentric. He is the king of the diddymen, the squire of Knotty Ash, the clown with the tickling stick and the owner of the most famous front teeth in the land. If the number of catchphrases is a mark of a comedian's success, Ken Dodd has done well, with such trademark sayings as "how tickled I am" and "by jove missus" and nonsense concoctions like "tattyfilarious" and "discomknockerated". At the Museum of Liverpool to launch an exhibition of photographs taken during his career, he fluffs up his hair for the cameras and wields a discomknockeratingly large tickling stick. This is his 60th year as a professional comedian - so has the eccentric image helped his career? "I'm not eccentric," he protests. "Not in the least." The funny thing is, he does not appear to be joking. In fact, he seems to take offence at the suggestion. Until now, the interview has been conducted with Dodd, eyes half-closed, recalling early BBC broadcasts from clubs and music halls in the 1950s. But now he is upright, looking me square in the eye. "I'm better dressed than you. You're wearing denim trousers. You look like an out-of-work plumber. "I'm not eccentric. Why am I eccentric?" There is the hair, the outfits, the tickling sticks, I suggest. "The hair bit - when I was a little boy I always wanted curly hair," he replies. "And part of it is a slight - only a very slight - rebellion. "I think all comedians are rebellious in various degrees. But I don't think I'm eccentric, no. Not in the least. I think I'm a very, very staid person. Very, very conservative." Not eccentric? Pull the other one, Doddy. He has cultivated the persona of the daffy professor of comedy since making his professional stage debut in 1954, inspired by the entertainers he saw while growing up in Liverpool. When Dodd was just seven or eight, his parents would take him and his brother and sister on weekly trips to variety theatres in the city. "Slowly this curtain would go up and you'd be transported into a magical world," he recalls. "Everything was rosy glow. Everything looked wonderful, happy. "This man came on - he'd wear a check suit with a red face and he'd shout at the audience. He would say things and everybody would fall about laughing. I thought, that's a good job, that's what I want to be." Today, his live sets are stuffed with affably absurd rapid-fire gags ("On Friday, there was a tap on the front door. That plumber's got a funny sense of humour"), plus slow-building storytelling and sentimental songs, to which he adds humorous lyrics. At times, his humour is masterful and timeless. At others, it is musty and old-fashioned, often based on "oo-er-missus" innuendo or creaky stereotypes of her indoors versus a useless husband. His crowds, largely made up of fans of a certain vintage, do not seem to mind, and the performances on his seemingly never-ending tour still regularly last five hours and more. "Comedians are jesters and jesters have a fools' licence," he says. "Political correctness doesn't apply to us. We are encouraged to say things that everybody would love to say but are scared stiff of saying. A jester is part-entertainer, part Mr Happy, part-anarchist." The star often speaks of how there are two Ken Dodds - the comedian and the real man. Asked what the private Ken Dodd does on his days off, he paints a picture of someone who is more serious than his on-stage image might suggest. "I can sum it up in one word - thinking," he replies. "As you go through life, you're given this wonderful brain to think with. Everybody wants to know the meaning of life. Where we've come from, where we're going to, what we do while we're here. Yeah, there's a lot of philosopher in every person's private life." Dodd also spends a lot of time researching the history and workings of humour. He used to visit a library in every town in which he performed, scouring books about comedy and comedians. "There are about 22 different rules for creating gags, comedy, jokes," he explains. At one point, Dodd mentions in passing how "the audience are my family". This is a reference to the fact that has never had children. He has also never married, although he has a long-term fiancee, Anne Jones, a singer, pianist and flautist who is the support act on his tour. The star says he was always ambivalent about having a family of his own, but has recently been reflecting on the subject while thinking about his own parents, who he describes as "the best mum and dad in the world". "I was driving the car about a year ago and suddenly the thought swept over me - by what right did I have to demand that two people, my mother and father, should take care of me, look after me, feed me, clothe me, nurse me when I'm ill? "We don't have any right to this. The more I think about this, this one word keeps popping up, a word that's much abused and maligned, but the word has been there for centuries - love. "There are all different kinds of love. Parents must love their children. I don't know. I suppose I would." In other words, he would have loved his children. He takes a rare pause for thought. "I love my dog. I love him very, very much," he goes on. "And all the dogs I've ever had, I've always loved them. So I must have the capacity to do it." The interview time is up and the real Ken Dodd retreats again. Eccentric? Yes. But there is more to him than meets the eye. The exhibition, titled By Jove! It's Ken Dodd!, features photographs by Stephen Shakeshaft and runs at the Museum of Liverpool until 21 April. </body>

      <title>Bombay Bicycle Club unveil new album</title>
      <description>Bombay Bicycle Club want to get fans dancing</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24805462</url>
      <date>1383896751</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70905000/jpg/_70905419_bbc-final-9343.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>If the old saying 'tidy house, tidy mind' holds true, then the mini studio-cum-'man cave' currently occupied by Bombay Bicycle Club frontman Jack Steadman is a worrying visual depiction of a chaotic mind. Luckily, that is completely at odds with the friendly, softly spoken bookish 20-something currently nibbling on a handful of olives. A large print of Max Ernst's 1921 surrealist painting Celebes dominates a smallish room with high ceilings - piled high on temporary shelves are albums and a pile of pillows that suggest that many evenings have turned into all-night recording sessions. Several acoustic guitars lean against the walls in varying states of decrepitude and a small portrait of Snoopy looks on. A mixing desk sits in front of the Ernst print, with speakers boasting petite jam jars on top, a copy of a vintage book on fishing sits on the coffee table. This little room of wonders in a non-descript office building in west London is where Steadman has been listening to the final mixes of songs from the band's forthcoming as-yet-untitled fourth studio album. In fact, the final mix of the album's closing track, the somewhat fitting So Long, See You Tomorrow has been sent to Steadman within the hour and he is itching to listen to it, which effectively means that this will be the first public play of the new material. It's all very exciting and actually a bit of privilege to be witness to a very small piece of history being made. The track is gorgeous, a long intro of descending minor chords before Steadman's airy falsetto waltzes in and out of a gentle melody. A false ending gives way to a full on, euphoric smack round the face ending. Steadman admits: "We wanted something that was a little bit like the Chemical Brothers". Just a few tracks have so far been released to the music press and admittedly without having heard much of the new album, it would be inappropriate to suggest it is the perfect finale. However, on the strength of a first listen, it sounds like a fitting ending to any album, particularly one that will be nearly three years in the waiting by the time it is released in early 2014. "We take a lot of time thinking about the album as a piece of art and how it should flow rather than just be happy with 10 good songs and not really care what order they go in," admits Steadman. "Its kind of like an added bonus for people who listen to the whole album," agrees bass player Ed Nash. Formed as The Canals in Crouch End in London in 2005 when they were teenagers, they eventually settled on Bombay Bicycle Club after a chain of Indian restaurants. Their debut album, I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose, was released in 2009, charting at number 46. Flaws, released in 2010, hit the top 10 with the acclaimed A Different Kind of Fix just missing the top five in 2011. Carry Me is the first track from the new album to have had its first play on national radio, on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show. It kicks off with range of samples and synthesizers and, at first listen, the electronic sound seems to be a radical departure from the three albums which precede it. However subsequent buzz on social networking sites has been positive despite Steadman's worries about fans' reactions. "The reaction has been the best we've had so far to new music," says Nash. But, playing a stealthy get out of jail free card, Steadman adds: "The stage we are at now, is that the expectation is the unexpected. So when people hear our single and it sounds completely different, then that comforts them I think because that's what they want". Take that would-be haters. The song's video too, is a massive step forward and allows the viewers to animate the band and two dancers. They have used stop-motion animation before in the video for How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep from their last album. The new video is inspired by the work of Eadweard Muybridge, an English pioneer of in motion-picture projection, most famous for his horse in motion, produced in 1878. Feel, another of the albums tracks begins with a sample of Bollywood-style music, influenced by a month Steadman spent in Mumbai. "Even before I went, I was getting into old Hindi film soundtracks and collecting them and there isn't really another style of music which has the same number of really catchy hooks," he explains. Rather than following the rather cliched well-trodden path of travelling to India to find himself spiritually, the singer immersed himself in the fast-moving, cacophonous buzz of the city which is home to 20 million people. "It's probably the most high-paced and generally crazy city that I've ever been to which meant I couldn't really relax, I always wanted to jump up run around make music." Nash, however, admits he spent the same amount of time in the altogether more sedate setting of Goa, the beach resort on India's west coast, "Yeah, I took one for the team," he smiles. Another track, Luna, begins with an Indian Tabla drum before launching into a piece of '80s-inspired synth-pop. Recorded at The Kinks' Konk Studios in London, the album is the first that Steadman has entirely produced himself. "We did go through a couple of producers but when it didn't work, we said, 'We think we've been avoiding the subject but maybe should do it ourselves'. It was a difficult decision," he admits. "The label has been good with us, I think they trust us, we're not a self indulgent band and we have no qualms about turning a song into something that's quite poppy". And the Chemical Brothers reference suggests the band want fans at forthcoming live shows to pull on their dancing shoes. "Yeah because some of our gigs have turned into manly fights with people killing each other", says Steadman. "It's quite a sight to behold because sometimes we're playing a really soft song and this circle in the pit starts and people are throwing punches at each other. "Sometimes the music we play is very aggressive." There is talk of a UK tour sometime early in the spring but for the time being there is the small matter of a name for the album. "There's a few things in the pipeline," said Nash. "It needs to sum up Eadweard Muybridge and loops and themes of the album. It's quite difficult". Any suggestions? </body>

      <title>The Good King Joffrey</title>
      <description>Game of Thrones' Jack Gleeson makes charity visit to Haiti</description>

      <body>It's a testament to Jack Gleeson's acting ability that most Game of Thrones fans may have to look twice at this picture. The young Irish actor is usually seen playing the tyrannical King Joffrey Baratheon - a man so evil, his own mother isn't sure she loves him. The role has propelled Jack to international acclaim, but unlike his bullish on-screen counterpart he is using his good fortune to help others. Earlier this week he travelled to the Haitian capital of Port au Prince to see the humanitarian work being carried out there by the charity Goal. It's almost four years since a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the country, displacing around 1.5m people. Jack described his trip as a "tremendous honour" and insisted it wasn't about distancing himself from the barbarous monarch he portrays on our TV screens. He willingly admits that he does not care what people think. "That's nothing to do with it really," he told the BBC. "I usually like to keep a low profile but that's a personal thing. I think that increases the audience's reaction to the show. They see me purely as the character." The HBO series has become a cult hit since its premier in 2011. Based on the novel A Song of Ice and Fire, it interweaves the stories of several noble houses, who are engaged in a raging civil war. Although the show features plenty of egregious villains, viewers would unanimously agree King Joffrey is in a league of his own. "I do get a bit of a shock when I see some of the scripts," said Jack. "But most of the time I read a scene and I rub my hands with glee. I get to work outside the standard back and forth dialogue. It's a very theatrical role." Much of the show is filmed on location in Northern Ireland and at the Titanic Studios in Belfast. Jack describes the city as "a home away from home". "I think the rest of the cast really like it too. Some of them took an exception to the weather, but in terms of Belfast people and Northern Irish people they're so welcoming," he said. "You don't really get stopped or asked for a picture. Perhaps they're too modest. They kind of leave us to it." Filming for the fourth season of the series will come to an end in the coming weeks, with the first episode due to air in March 2014. There are no impending spoilers ahead. Jack refused to divulge what happens next. "I can't really say too much. But the characters are getting more and more desperate and more intense. There are also some new characters and some will be leaving. "I actually read the first book, along with the online summaries. So I know the fate of my character. "Some of the cast haven't read it, like Lena Headey. I know she really enjoys watching the show so every time she gets a script it's the unknown." Although his day job is a time-consuming one, Jack manages to pursue several other projects and is a full-time student at Trinity College in Dublin. His trip to Haiti presented the 21-year-old with an altogether different challenge and got him out of his "comfort zone". He visited several projects including schools and housing camps and spent time with people who lost loved ones and livelihoods in the disaster. It's a far cry from the glamour of the television set. "It was very surreal," said Jack, as he described the moment he landed in Port au Prince. "It's a profound juxtaposition to find yourself in. Not just from my fictional character, but from my real life in Dublin. "When it's presented in the media it's very easy to abstract yourself and fictionalise the event. "Haiti was a profoundly impoverished country even before the earthquake, so to see it get back on its feet is uplifting. "They're so self-motivated here." Despite landing a lead role in a hit TV series and embarking on charity missions across the world, Jack is unsure whether life in the spotlight is entirely right for him. He has spoken of his desire to step away from acting in favour of a career in academia something he feels "really guilty about". "Everyone dreams of working on a successful show and it is a great opportunity. "I haven't decided yet. Acting isn't my priority at the moment. I really like being a student. "But I'm reticent to speak in definites. I'm a young bright-eyed man, so I may change my mind." Game of Thrones fans will certainly hope so. </body>

      <title>Beatles in Belfast - 50 years ago</title>
      <description>The day the Beatles came to Belfast</description>

      <body>These were the scenes in Belfast city centre 50 years ago. Thousands of screaming fans gathered outside the Ritz Cinema in Fisherwick Place to catch a glimpse of the band that was making people scream, cry and faint during their 1963 autumn tour. Among the crowd was 13-year-old Margaret Flynn. She was not able to get a ticket - but nevertheless, she wanted to soak up the atmosphere. "My friends and I walked down the Grosvenor Road to the Ritz and were just met with a sea of people," she said. "Screaming girls and lots of boys too - but of course we weren't getting anywhere near it. The police had crowd control and barriers everywhere." One of the officers on duty that night was Evelyn - who remembers seeing girls crying on each others' shoulders and fainting. She said there was a big security operation in the city centre. It was a great night for her because she was also a Beatles fan and got to see the Fab Four as they walked into the cinema. She said one of them - she cannot remember who - even waved at her. "I think I floated back to the station that night." Others, like schoolboy Christopher Hill - now a professional photographer - queued up all night to get tickets a month before the band came to play. He got a seat on the second row in the middle and was able to capture some great photographs. He ended up selling around 800 of them to local students. "I had girls at the local schools who sold them for me without commission just for the glory of being able to sell these original Beatles photographs. People still bump into me and say, 'I remember the photographs I bought from you in 1963,' " he said. One of those who still treasures one of those photographs is his friend Chris Maccabe, who was with him that night. The day after the concert he got his hair styled exactly like the Beatles. He remembers it as being a time of change for Northern Ireland "As I recall there were some protests from politicians and church leaders who felt the Beatles were breaking a mould that wasn't acceptable... Belfast was a very strict place and the Beatles brought a degree of fun, and I suppose broke down some barriers because they were extremely innocent and their songs at that time were very innocent too," he said. For some, like Margaret, who didn't manage to see the Beatles this time, there would be success in the future. The Beatles returned to Belfast in 1964 to play the Ulster Hall and, that time, she did manage to get tickets. </body>
