      <body>At least 30 people have been killed by a suicide truck bombing on the edge of the central Syrian city of Hama. State news agency Sana said Syrian rebels had driven a truck laden with over a tonne of explosives into a government checkpoint on a busy road. The explosion appears to have set ablaze a nearby petrol tanker, increasing the damage and casualties. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front carried out the attack. "A man detonated a truck laden with explosives at a checkpoint near an agricultural vehicles company on the road linking Hama to Salamiya," the Observatory said. It said the attack had targeted government soldiers, but that most of the dead were civilians. Pictures on Syria TV showed firemen battling to contain fires as black smoke rose from charred trucks and cars. A man who received leg injuries in the blast told Syrian state TV: "I was heading to a school in Salamiya and the blast started. "These innocent people don't deserve this. The scene is inhumane. These terrorists shouldn't be in this country." Hama saw some of the largest demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad in the first months after the Syrian uprising began in March 2011. But in late summer 2011, security forces stormed the city and have maintained control ever since. Hama occupies a significant place in the history of modern Syria. In 1982, then-President Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar, sent in troops to quell an uprising by the Sunni opposition Muslim Brotherhood. Tens of thousands were killed and the town flattened. Meanwhile, the head of the Arab League has said that a long-awaited conference on Syria will begin on 23 November, although this falls short of a formal announcement. Nabil el-Arabi was speaking after meeting the international envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, who is on a tour of the Middle East to prepare for the conference. Mr Brahimi did not himself publicly set a date, saying he would do so after his tour. Mr el-Arabi conceded that there were still many obstacles ahead. Western and Arab government officials will meet Syrian opposition leaders on Tuesday to try to persuade them to attend. </body>

      <title>Ferdinand &amp; Hodgson join FA commission</title>
      <description>England boss Roy Hodgson and former captain Rio Ferdinand are appointed to the FA commission to improve the national team.</description>

      <body>Ex-England captain Rio Ferdinand and manager Roy Hodgson have been named on the Football Association's commission to improve the national team. The appointments come one day after Heather Rabbatts, the FA's only female board member, criticised the group's all-white, all-male make-up. Hodgson last week steered England to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil. Ferdinand, 34, quit international football in May after winning the last of his 81 caps in June 2011. The centre-back, who helped Manchester United win the Premier League title last season, is the first non-white member of the 10-person panel. On Saturday, Rabbatts accused the FA of letting down black and ethnic minority people with the make-up of the commission. FA chairman Greg Dyke said in a statement: "Rio's vast experience as a player developed through West Ham's successful youth system, winning Premier League and European titles with Manchester United and representing England at World Cups means he has a huge amount to offer to the debate. "We have been speaking to Rio and Manchester United for some time about him joining the group - before we named the other members of the Commission. "However, as he is a current Manchester United player we needed to be sure that Rio had the necessary time to fully participate on the Commission and not impact on his day job. It has been agreed he does. "As a current player with forthright views and opinions on the game, we can look forward to Rio providing significant insight and experience." Ferdinand and Hodgson join FA vice-chairman Roger Burden, former England manager Glenn Hoddle, ex-England defender Danny Mills, League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson, Professional Footballers' Association chairman Ritchie Humphreys, Football League chairman Greg Clarke and Crewe director of football Dario Gradi on the panel. Dyke said he delayed announcing Hodgson's appointment until England's World Cup qualifying campaign had been completed. "It is important Roy can offer his views as the current manager of the national team and share the knowledge he has gained when working for many years in a number of countries," he said. "It is important we do not lose sight of the Commission's main purpose. That is - finding a way of delivering long-term success for the England men's senior team, particularly by identifying ways to increase the number of players available to the national team playing regularly at the highest level of English football or abroad."

      <title>Australia declares fire emergency</title>
      <description>A state of emergency is declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that are expected to worsen in hot and windy weather.</description>

      <body>A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that have already destroyed more than 200 homes. The announcement comes as conditions look set to deteriorate with soaring temperatures and strong winds expected to fan the flames in the coming days. The Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, has been the worst-hit region with some fires still raging out of control. State officials say they are the most dangerous conditions in 40 years. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell said the declaration would give emergency services additional powers over the next 30 days. These could include cutting gas and power supplies if needed and ordering mandatory evacuations. "We're planning for the worst but hoping for the best," he said. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. One firefighter, 24-year-old Tim Boxwell, said he had lost his own home in Winmalee, on the eastern edge of the Blue Mountains, to the fire while he was on duty. "I'd been standing watching other people's houses burn and the emotion from that was bad enough. To be hit with your own house being lost was a shock as well," he told BBC's Newshour. Officials have warned that the three main bushfires - two in the Blue Mountains and one near the town of Lithgow - could become one huge fire in the coming days, possibly threatening Sydney. A fire service spokesman said: "We can understand the magnitude of that as it would then creep into the bottom end of Sydney. It's certainly something that we're very concerned about." The foot of the Blue Mountains lies just across the Nepean River from the suburbs of Sydney. Some embers jumped its banks last Thursday, starting a fire at Castlereagh near Penrith. After several cooler days, forecasters are predicting the return of unseasonably hot weather - with temperatures reaching 30C (86F) and higher. The heat wave would probably peak on Wednesday, warned Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, but there would be little relief in the intervening period. "We've got what would be unparalleled in terms of risk and exposure to the Blue Mountains throughout this week. If you are to draw a parallel, and it's always dangerous to draw a parallel, at best you'd be going back to time periods in the late 60s. "The reality is, however, these conditions that we're looking at are a whole new ball game and in a league of their own," the commissioner said. Mr O'Farrell said crews had carried out controlled burn operations overnight to strengthen buffer zones around the major fires. An emergency warning was issued for the Blue Mountains village of Bell on Sunday morning. Residents were urged to evacuate or to take shelter "in a solid structure when the fire front arrives". Villagers in Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine, meanwhile, were ordered to stay in their homes after fire cut off access roads. Residents of nearby Bilpin were warned that if they did not evacuate, they could be isolated without power for several days. Assistant police commissioner Alan Clarke said mandatory evacuation orders would be enforced in some areas, describing the risk as "far more extreme" than in past fires. "At the end of the day we hope we have buildings standing, but if we don't have buildings standing we don't want bodies in them," he said. More than 37,000 hectares (91,400 acres) have already been ravaged by fire in the state in the past several days. Officials say that 15 blazes remain out of control. Smoke and ash from the bushfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Australia's military is currently investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the fires. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. In the past, many such fires have turned out to have been started deliberately, and police say they are monitoring dozens of "firebugs" - people with a history of committing arson, the BBC's Jon Donnison reports from Sydney. Our correspondent says the blazes have come unusually early in the season and follow Australia's hottest year on record.

      <title>Hayling Island 'hit by tornado'</title>
      <description>About 100 homes are damaged when a "tornado" hits Hayling Island in Hampshire.</description>

      <body>About 100 homes have been damaged by a "tornado" on Hayling Island in Hampshire, police have said. Havant Council said properties in Blackthorn Road and Ilex Walk were damaged by high winds at about 08:00 BST. The council said there were no reported injuries and its officers were assessing the damage to properties. Kayla Killshaw-Laing, who was staying on the island overnight, described the experience as "horrendous". Hampshire Constabulary has received calls regarding damaged vehicles, power lines, and beach huts. Highway teams are currently clearing up debris around the area. Eyewitness Marcus Hunt said: "My wife and I watched a swirl of sea water and rain come across the sea and hit land in front of our house on Hayling seafront. "The sky was extremely black and there were lots of squalls and then the tornado whipped up. It must have been 30ft to 40ft across. We saw it pick lots of spray and shingle off the beach." Tony Hunt, from Guildford, Surrey, said he discovered his beach hut on the island had been shunted 2m [6ft 6in] across the beach. The roof was ripped off and parts of it were found 400m (1,300ft) away on the other side of the road. He said: "We drove down to survey the damage and were quite shocked by what we saw... the neighbouring hut was lifted too." Ms Killshaw-Laing said: "There was this horrendous crashing sound… the dogs were barking so I went to the window and looked out and this huge tree just landed on top of my parents' car. "I was in a panic… I'm just staying here for the night, I was here to tidy their front garden, how ironic. "We've had to have chainsaws to saw the whole thing up and remove it, but the caravan flipped over next door." High winds also damaged properties several miles away in Gosport. Gaynor Wood, who lives there, said: "The wind sucked the loft hatch cover into the roof space, slammed the bedroom doors and shut the window. "It was over very quickly and seems to have been extremely isolated - our house is semi-detached and yet the neighbours don't seem to have been hit. "The tiles bounced off the roof, scraped the front of the house and damaged two cars in the drive. "My husband's brand new car has had its roof pierced by roof tiles." Ian Hoult, head of emergency planning at Hampshire County Council, said a number of roofs had been damaged and trees uprooted. He said: "Fortunately we don't know of anyone being hurt, but it's an interesting situation for a Sunday morning." BBC Weather's Emma Boorman said heavy and thundery showers had moved across the area and gusts of between 45 mph and 50 mph were reported. She added: "The damage reported in Hayling Island is consistent with what you might expect from a small tornado, which is feasible in this weather situation." One or two tornados are typically reported along England's south coast each year, BBC Weather said.

      <title>Alps murders police 'covering up'</title>
      <description>The brother of a Briton among four people killed in the Alps denies arranging the murders, and says French police do not want to find a French culprit.</description>

      <body>The brother of a British man killed with his wife and mother-in-law while on holiday in the Alps has denied arranging their murder. Zaid al-Hilli, from Surrey, has accused French police of "covering up" the real target of the killings in 2012 and also offered to take a lie-detector test. He remains on bail after being arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder. The French prosecutor said he was convinced there was a very serious feud between the brothers. Saad al-Hilli and his wife Iqbal, from Claygate, her mother Suhaila al-Allaf and French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, were shot on 5 September 2012. The bodies of the four victims were found on a remote forest road in Chevaline near Lake Annecy. The two young daughters survived the attack, one by hiding under her dead mother's skirt. Saad's brother Zaid, who is from Chessington, was arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to murder amid claims he doctored documents to ensure he inherited the family estate following the death of their father. Zaid denied arranging the killings and said the accusations were "ridiculous." He rejected claims of a feud between the brothers over the inheritance. He said they got on well despite only communicating through their lawyers in the eleven months before the attack. "Our relationship was very brotherly and very close, and we looked after each other," he said. He declined to answer questions about his father's will because British police are investigating him for possible fraud. He said French police shut down their investigation into the murder of the cyclist, Sylvain Mollier, too soon. "They are covering up for someone in France in that region and they know it. "Sylvain Mollier was involved in family disputes and was an outsider to [his] rich family. There is something more to it locally... most crime has local roots." The French prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, has said he is sure the cyclist was there by accident and is convinced there was a feud between the brothers. "The police have investigated Sylvain Mollier's family as far as they could. There is nothing to link Mollier to this murder," he said. "The investigators have become convinced that Zaid tried to steal from his father, one way or another, and that there was a very serious feud between the two brothers. "Saad al-Hilli was afraid of his brother and had changed the locks at the house and fitted a new alarm." Mr Maillaud said French investigators will solve the mystery of the Annecy murders however long it takes.

      <title>Minister: Police culture will change</title>
      <description>Policing will become more open, with independent overseers given more powers to stamp out wrongdoing, a Home Office minister says.</description>

      <body>The "culture" of policing will improve, with independent overseers given "more powers" to investigate wrongdoing, a Home Office minister has pledged. Damian Green said the "Plebgate" investigation was "one incident among many", citing the Hillsborough cover-up and the death of Ian Tomlinson. But only a small minority of officers had acted inappropriately, he added. The Independent Police Complaints Commission was working to ensure greater "openness", Mr Green said. A Sunday Times poll by YouGov suggests 66% of the public trust the police, down from 71% in August. The figures come after several controversies involving police over the last few years. In August the Metropolitan Police apologised to the family of Ian Tomlinson over his death at the G20 protests in London in 2009, with one officer using "excessive" force. Last year David Cameron apologised for a police cover-up over the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans died in 1989. And, on Wednesday, the chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain the handling of a meeting between officers and former government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The MP resigned after he was accused of calling Downing Street police "plebs" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held during the weeks following the claims. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did. Mr Green said the officers' comments had been "palpably untrue", adding: "He deserves an apology." Mr Green added: "Andrew Mitchell clearly can command the resources that other people might not be able to prove that what individual police officers said about him wasn't true. So that's the key underlying issue." Mr Green said: "If police officers behave badly then it's really serious for the police. But it's a very small minority who behave badly. By and large the police do their job well." Citing the Sunday Times poll, he added: "Two-thirds of people still have confidence in the police, which is quite surprising given the spate of stories." However, the government was increasing resources for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and was changing police recruitment to ensure people with a background from outside the service could enter at a senior level. Mr Green said: "The fact that people will bring a new attitude and background will help the police service. It will open it up." He added: "The IPCC needs more powers and resources, We are giving it both. It's not just a question of following rules. It's a question of having a culture of openness and transparency." Former Metropolitan Police detective Peter Kirkham told the BBC's Sunday Politics there was not a "culture of deceit" among officers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC One's Sunday Politics he had "always believed" Mr Mitchell's account of Plebgate. "I'd be honoured to sit with Andrew Mitchell in the cabinet," he said. </body>

      <description>The Combined Maritime Force, under British command, catches pirates believed to have been responsible for two attacks off the Somali coast.</description>

      <body>A counter-piracy task force commanded by a Royal Navy officer has caught a group of Somalis believed responsible for two attacks in the Indian Ocean. Pirates had exchanged gunfire with a super tanker on Friday 11 October before attacking a Spanish fishing vessel three days later. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) traced the pirates' skiffs from Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria. Nine men were caught and forces later destroyed two boats and equipment. Commodore Jeremy Blunden, Royal Navy, Commander of CTF-151, said: "This is an excellent result. "My multinational counter piracy forces swiftly located and dealt with this Somali pirate group, sending a clear message that piracy no longer pays." Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, as the group is known, embarked on board RFA Fort Victoria with support from Australian guided-missile frigate HMAS Melbourne and South Korean destroyer ROKS Wang Geon. The European Union flagship Dutch HNLMS Johan de Witt - flagship of the EU naval force in the area - and maritime patrol aircraft from Luxembourg were also part of the mission. After tracing the pirates an HMAS Melbourne Seahawk guided the warship to their precise location, 500 nautical miles off the Somali coast, before a boarding team made the final approach to search the skiffs. Commander Brian Schlegel, Royal Australian Navy, commanded HMAS Melbourne during the operation. He said: "It is clear that there are still pirates out there determined to generate income from taking merchant ships hostage. "Mariners have been served a timely reminder of the perils of transiting the Somali coastline." CMF is a multinational naval partnership with 29 nation members. Its aim is to promotes security, stability and prosperity across 2.5 million square miles of international waters. </body>

      <body>The brother-in-law of a Sheffield man who drowned in the sea off Cyprus while saving a man in difficulty has spoken of the family's loss. Keith West, 50, had been holidaying on the island with his fiancee Julie Davies while the couple planned their wedding there next year. Mr West was caught in an undercurrent on 14 October after rescuing a man. His brother-in-law, Steve Robjohns, said Mr West "would not have hesitated" to help someone in danger. "Keith was an old fashioned Yorkshireman. He was brilliant, he was true, and there wasn't a bad bone in his body. "It doesn't come as a surprise to me that he's done what he's done," said Mr Robjohns. It is believed Mr West was walking along the beach with his fiancee when he saw a man in trouble in the water and tried to help, said Mr Robjohns. He managed to save the man but was then caught by a wave and pulled under the water. Mr West had been submerged for about 10 minutes before a lifeguard found him and he could not be resuscitated. Ms Davies was "badly cut up" about her partner's death, said Mr Robjohns. "She has just had him pulled away from her and she can't get to grips with the fact she's never going to see him again," he said. "It's truly awful and all our hearts and minds go out to Julie who absolutely loved him to bits. It's truly heart-rending stuff." The Foreign Office said it was aware of the death of a British national on Cyprus and was providing consular assistance to the family. </body>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said he understood people who found the latest price hikes "inexplicable". The former oil executive said companies had to "justify fully" their actions. Last week, British Gas followed SSE's rises with a 9.2% increase in its dual-fuel bill price. The archbishop told the Mail on Sunday: "The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this. "I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high." Amid predictions that the four other major energy suppliers - EDF, E.On, npower, Scottish Power - will now also raise their prices, Archbishop Welby urged firms to be "conscious of their social obligations". He added they had to to "behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity". "They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it," he said. "With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. "It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. "The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed." The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, previously suggested the City of London has been affected by a "culture of entitlement" at variance with what others think reasonable and hit out at payday lenders charging high interest rates. He said he was concerned that fuel poverty was "a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up". "It ties in with the food banks and the debt," he said. "They are all part of the reality of life for many people today." The rise in energy costs has sparked a huge political debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband pledging a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he was "disappointed" by the rises but described Mr Miliband's plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. He has said consumers should look to switch suppliers to keep bills down. </body>

      <body>The widow of the Communist leader of what was once Yugoslavia has died in Belgrade of a heart attack, aged 88. Jovanka Broz joined the partisans led by Josip Broz Tito who fought the Nazi occupation in World War Two. She became first Tito's personal secretary, then his third wife in 1952. After Tito died in 1980, she lived her last three decades in isolation, under house arrest for a time. She was left stateless by the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. "With Broz's death, we are left without one of the last most reliable witnesses of our former country's history,'' Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said in a message of condolence. Jovanka Budisavljevic, an ethnic Serb, was born into a farming family in what is now Croatia on 7 December 1924. She joined the partisans when she was just 17, remaining with them until the end of the war in 1945. After her marriage to Yugoslavia's authoritarian president Josip Broz - known as Tito - she spent nearly three decades as first lady. But after he died, she was placed under house arrest, accused of plotting a coup. She lived in seclusion in the Belgrade suburb of Dedinje and rarely gave interviews. Speaking to the Politika daily in 2009, she said of the period after her husband's death: "They chased me out ... in my nightgown, without anything, not allowing me even to take a photo of the two of us, or a letter, a book." Since then, "I was in isolation and treated like a criminal... I could not leave the house without armed guards," she said. Mrs Broz had been admitted to hospital in August in a serious condition, suffering from heart problems. Her last wish was to be buried in the House of Flowers, in Belgrade, next to Tito. </body>

      <body>Stars including Simon Pegg and Matt Lucas have expressed their sorrow at the death of comic and actor Felix Dexter, who died on Friday of cancer. The St Kitts-born Londoner, 52, had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Star Trek and Shaun of the Dead star Pegg tweeted: "Very sad to hear news of his passing. Very funny man." Little Britain's Lucas added that the Real McCoy star was: "A brilliant performer and ...a very nice man." Comedian and QI panellist Alan Davis added his voice to the tributes, saying that his memories of Dexter went back a long way. He tweeted: "Sad and shocked to hear about Felix Dexter passing away. So many gigs with him back in the olden days. Always a pleasure. RIP Felix." Fellow comic and presenter Dara O Briain linked on Twitter to a clip of Dexter performing as "the accountant" in 90s flagship black comedy The Real McCoy, adding he was "so sad" to hear the news. Comedian and star of The Infidel Omid Djalili described Dexter as "one of the very few who made me howl", while actor David Schneider tweeted: "Lovely, lovely guy. And I think nothing on TV has ever made me laugh more than his Real McCoy Nigerian character", referencing the Real McCoy clip linked to by O Briain. Actor David Morrissey, who has starred in TV series The Walking Dead and State of Play, said he worked with Dexter a while ago, describing him as a "funny, talented and generous man". Comedian Jenny Eclair added: "Terribly sad news about a very nice man who did a lot of fabulous work." Former Brookside star Louis Emerick said Dexter was a "very funny, talented man, gentleman!" tweeting: "Gone too soon." Dexter moved to the UK when he was aged seven and came to prominence in The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." </body>

      <title>Stag mating call mimic contest held</title>
      <description>A "bolving" competition to find out who can best mimic the mating call of a stag takes place on Exmoor.</description>

      <body>A competition to find out who can best mimic the mating call of a stag has taken place on Exmoor. The event for the sport known as bolving started 10 years ago and organisers said competitors took it "very seriously". The challenge for the participants imitating the low bellowing sound of the red deer is for a real stag to answer their call. This year 45 people took part in the event held near Dulverton, Somerset. Exmoor National Park ranger and former competition winner Richard Eales organised the 10th annual championship. He said bolving referred to the noise made by red deer during the rutting season, which normally starts from early to mid-October. He said: "The red deer make a roar - a challenge - and you can mimic it and get the red stag to answer you, "It's a deep sort of roar from the belly, it's got to come from the belly. "You open your throat, put your hands up and it's got to be a blood curdling roar from inside." He said the bigger stags rounded up the females known as hinds. "One stag will keep his harem of hinds together, but this is his challenge - this roar. The basic line is 'come and have a go if you think you're hard enough'. "You'll get two big stags and they'll be bolving, running around sizing each other up, then they'll have a bit of a tussle and the weaker stag normally gets pushed off. "Or if they're evenly matched then that's when you get the classic rutting scene of the red deer stags going down and locking antlers and having a bit of a battle." The competition was won by Rob Follett, 35, from Withycombe, Devon, who was among the competitors who got a response call from a stag. He said it was the first time he had plucked up the courage to enter the contest. He said: "I can't believe I have won. I love watching the deer and have listened to the stags call and roar over the years." All money raised will be given to the Devon Air Ambulance Trust. </body>

      <title>Depp gives award to Christopher Lee</title>
      <description>Actor Sir Christopher Lee says receiving his British Institute Fellowship from Johnny Depp was a "very emotional moment", as Ida, a depiction of the Holocaust, wins the best film prize at London Film Festival.</description>

      <body>Hammer horror star Sir Christopher Lee said it was a "very emotional moment" when he received his British Institute Fellowship from his friend Johnny Depp. He tearfully accepted the award at the London Film Festival, saying: "I didn't know you were going to be here. I must try and pull myself together." The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. Screenwriter Jonathan Asser won best British newcomer. He took the accolade for his debut feature Starred Up, about the practice of placing violent young offenders prematurely in adult prison. BFI fellow and film critic Philip French said of Ida that the jury was "deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation". Sir Christopher, 91, who described receiving his award as "a great joy", is famed for his villainous portrayals of Bond bad guy Scaramanga and evil wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings. He has amassed more than 250 screen credits, including The Wicker Man, The Man with the Golden Gun and more recently, several Tim Burton films including Sleepy Hollow, which starred Depp. He also played Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Depp, who sneaked into the awards ceremony to surprise his friend, said it was his "great honour" to present the award to "a very great man", saying he had been "fascinated and inspired" by him. "He's been a wonderful individual and over the years I've had the pleasure of working with him and it has been a childhood dream come true," he said. "But as great as it is to work with him, that pleasure doesn't compare with getting to know him and being able to count him as a true friend. "A national treasure and a genuine artist. I love ya!" Sir Christopher responded by saying: "I can't thank you enough," in reference to Depp, who he had been told could not make the occasion as he was elsewhere. He went on : "When I take a look back, and it's a long one, 67 years, at the characters I've played I get a truly strange feeling they were all played by somebody else, and not by me. "And there are a few occasions when it has been the case I wish it had!" He said of Depp: "He means an enormous amount to me. He is one of very few young actors on screen today who's truly a star. "Everything he does has a meaning. He's a joy to work with, an actor's dream and certainly a director's dream. I could go on a long time but I'd probably embarrass him." The festival presented the Sutherland Award, for the most original and imaginative film debut, to Anthony Chen, who directed Ilo Ilo, which explores the life and vulnerabilities of a modern affluent family in Singapore. The Grierson award for the best documentary went to Paul-Julien Robert's My Fathers, My Mother and Me, a portrayal of life in Friedrichshof, the largest commune in Europe, which was founded in the 70s. The film reveals the devastating emotional effects of life there on its residents, and jury president Kate Ogborn said the "disturbing film" raised "larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse". The film festival closes later with the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a dramatisation of the making of 1964 movie Mary Poppins starring Emma Thompson as author PL Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Hanks appeared at Bafta's London headquarters on Saturday to give a Life in Pictures talk, during which he revealed some of the difficulties he faced playing "Uncle Walt" on screen. "Walt Disney died of lung cancer; he smoked three packs a day," the two-time Oscar winner told host Francine Stock. "But can we show him smoking in a major motion picture these days? No way in hell. "It's this thing that has happened in movies - real people can't smoke. We literally had a negotiation over whether I could hold a lit cigarette in a scene." In a wide-ranging discussion covering his 30-year film career, Hanks said his success was partly down to his not having "a bigger-than-life persona". "I'm charming as hell, but I don't strike fear and I don't have a huge amount of mystery," he explained. "You're not worried about me killing you, or stealing your daughter, or being some sort of criminal mastermind. "I view myself as a guy that if I had been a good student, I could be a historian," he continued. "And if I had been good at science, I could be a doctor. "I'm not good at any of those things so I'm an actor. These movies, these roles, they're always something that - if I was a little more accomplished - I could be that guy." Hanks can currently be seen in cinemas in Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival on 9 October. Saving Mr Banks is out in the UK on 29 November. </body>

      <description>England second row Courtney Lawes stars as Northampton beat Ospreys to go second in Pool One of the Heineken Cup.</description>

      <body>England lock Courtney Lawes impressed as Northampton beat Ospreys to go second in Pool One of the Heineken Cup. A Samu Manoa try and Stephen Myler conversion and penalty gave Northampton the lead before Dan Biggar landed two penalties for the visitors. Christian Day's converted try made it 17-6 at the break, only for Ospreys to hit back through a try, conversion and penalty from Biggar. But Ben Foden added a third Northampton try and Myler's boot saw Saints home. The hosts will be frustrated not to have secured a bonus point for scoring four tries, with George Pisi held a couple of feet short from a last-gasp Northampton attack, but in the end they were convincing winners. Lawes, along with fellow England forwards Dylan Hartley and Tom Wood, was outstanding in all facets of the game, although the lock's work at the line-out and in the tackle - he made 20 - was particularly noteworthy. And the 6ft 7in second row set the tone from the first whistle as he drilled Tom Habberfield backwards when the Ospreys scrum-half caught the kick-off. George North then hammered into midfield and an Ospreys offside gave Myler the chance to kick the hosts into the lead. When Manoa picked up from the base of a five-metre scrum and went over untouched, with Myler converting, with less than 15 minutes played it seemed as though Northampton were set for an easy win. But Ospreys, who went into the game on the back of a disappointing home defeat by Leinster, were determined to put up a fight and two Biggar penalties cut the gap to four points. However, Northampton were looking by far the more threatening side and they added to their lead almost immediately. Luther Burrell made a couple of big carries into midfield before the hosts went wide and Lawes - who had started things with a soaring line-out take - sent second row partner Day over in the corner for a converted score. It was turning into a spectacular game, with Northampton fizzing the ball about at pace but unable to finish things off, and the visitors prepared to counter-attack whenever they were presented with the opportunity. They turned round 17-6 down, needing to score next if the match was not to run away from them, and they duly lifted their game after the restart. Captain Alun Wyn Jones was at the heart of their charge and after he was held inches short, Biggar wriggled his way over by the posts before adding the conversion. Suddenly there were only four points in it and Northampton's cause was not helped as Myler missed a simple penalty, but approaching the hour mark they stretched clear again. The Saints pack bullied their way to within inches of the line from a line-out drive before Lee Dickson sent full-back Foden over unopposed. Myler converted from out wide and an exchange of penalties by the two fly-halves concluded the scoring, with a potentially important fourth try for Saints proving elusive. Northampton: Foden; Elliott, G Pisi, Burrell, North; Myler, L Dickson; A Waller, Hartley, Ma'afu, Lawes, Day, Dowson, Wood, Manoa. Replacements: K Pisi for Elliott (75), Fotuali'i for L.

      <title>Guide to Rugby League World Cup 2013</title>
      <description>A quirky format, a stolen trophy and analysis of key teams - everything you need to know about the Rugby League World Cup</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/rugby-league/23988010</url>

      <body>The 14th Rugby League World Cup begins on 26 October with England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland aiming to end 38 years of southern hemisphere dominance. The 14-team tournament sees 28 matches taking place across England, Wales, Ireland and France. England, where the bulk of the games are being played, begin proceedings when they host Australia in the double-headed opener at Cardiff on Saturday. Steve McNamara's men are only third favourites - behind overwhelming front-runners Australia and holders New Zealand - to be crowned world champions at Manchester's Old Trafford stadium on 30 November. Scotland, Wales and Ireland are considered rank outsiders to become the first northern hemisphere winners since a unified Great Britain team triumphed in the 1972 edition. The World Cup is viewed as the latest event in the UK's 'golden decade of sport', which centred around London 2012 and also includes the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games and the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup. Domestic governing body the Rugby Football League  hopes the tournament can capitalise on the success of last year's Olympic and Paralympic Games and boost the profile of the sport, helping it to expand beyond its traditional Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cumbrian heartlands. "The World Cup is a wonderful opportunity to reach out to new audiences who want to be involved in the next major international sporting event after London 2012," said Rugby League World Cup tournament director Nigel Wood. "Ticket sales have been very encouraging, with strong buying patterns from people who have never previously bought tickets for rugby league events." Here, BBC Sport tells you everything you need to know about the competition's teams, format, venues and history. With an ever-changing format, long gaps between tournaments and on-field mismatches, the Rugby League World Cup has not been easy for supporters, new and old, to follow. But the last edition, hosted by Australia in 2008, proved to be a resounding success, drawing large crowds and an impressive worldwide television audience. It prompted the Rugby League International Federation  to approve a proposal to expand from 10 to 14 teams for this year's tournament. Pool A and Pool B are each comprised of four teams, including Australia and England in the former and New Zealand in the latter, and the top three sides from those groups will progress to the quarter-finals. There are only three teams in each of Pool C and Pool D, which means the sides play each other and then one nation from the opposite group. Only the group winners earn a place in the last eight. "The idea is that we don't have any of the blow-outs that you see in other World Cups," said communications manager Martin Johnson. "So every team will go into the group stages thinking they have a chance of winning their group, although that will be a bit harder in the elite groups. "But every team in groups C and D has a chance of winning a game and no team should go home without scoring a few tries - and that's better for the supporters and better for the development of the game." Former England skipper Jamie Peacock, who is part of BBC Sport's commentary team for the World Cup and will have a weekly column on the website, played almost 50 times for England and Great Britain before retiring from international duty in June 2012. The Leeds Rhinos prop, 35, analyses the chances of each of the home nations, Australia and New Zealand. Coach: Tim Sheens Captain: Cameron Smith Star man: Johnathan Thurston (half-back) Appearances: 13 Best: Champions (1957, 1968, 1970, 1975, 1977, 1988, 1992, 1995, 2000) Jamie Peacock's view: "Australia are the overwhelming favourites - but they are beatable. New Zealand have proved that in big games, including the 2008 World Cup final. "The Aussies are very effective at international level and it is a big help that their four key players - Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk, Cameron Smith and Billy Slater - play together for Queensland in the State of Origin. That's another high-pressure situation. "Australia have the biggest pool of players to pick from so it is no surprise that they are the favourites." Australia's World Cup squad Coach: Steve McNamara Captain: Kevin Sinfield Star man: Sam Burgess (prop forward) Appearances: Four (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: Runner-up (1975, 1995) * Great Britain were three-time champions (1954, 1960, 1972) Jamie Peacock's view: "They have a great chance of winning the tournament, especially with home advantage. That's a big bonus. Look at the Olympics, some of the performances from the British athletes rose to levels that they didn't know they could reach. "All the main players are fully fit and Steve McNamara has managed to break down the barriers of the club rivalries which exist between the players on a weekly basis in the Super League. This is something that others haven't been able to do in the past. "And they have got Sam Burgess, who is the best forward in the world. That's because he can play prop, second row or loose forward as well as anyone else in the world." England's World Cup squad Coach: Stephen Kearney Captain: Simon Mannering Star man: Sonny Bill Williams (second row) Appearances: 13 Best: Champions (2008) Jamie Peacock's view: "Defending champions New Zealand have got every chance of upsetting the odds again and repeating their 2008 success. "They have a lot of players who not only start regularly in the NRL, but are key players for their sides. "The Kiwis have lost their last five Tests against the Aussies but have managed to beat them in the big games like the 2008 World Cup and Four Nations. "Sonny Bill Williams being available is huge for New Zealand and the tournament. He's just helped Sydney Roosters win the NRL and he lit up the competition. "Everyone wants to see the star players at the World Cup and Sonny Bill is a name that transcends sports because of his spells in rugby union and boxing." New Zealand's World Cup squad Coach: Steve McCormack Captain: Danny Brough Star man: Danny Brough (half-back) Appearances: Two (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: One win (2008) Jamie Peacock's view: "Undoubtedly, the Super League's 2013 Man of Steel Danny Brough is going to the main man for Scotland. He will dictate everything they do - it will all run through him. "The other players will look up to Brough. He is the Huddersfield captain and showed his leadership skills as they won the Super League Leaders' Shield. He will have to do that - and more - for Scotland." Scotland's World Cup squad Coach: Iestyn Harris Captain: Craig Kopczak Star men: Ben Flower (Prop) and Craig Kopczak (Prop) Appearances: Three (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: Semi-finalists (1995, 2000) Jamie Peacock's view: "Wales are growing as a force every year under Iestyn Harris. He has got a good squad together, with plenty of young players. "For them, this World Cup is all about gaining experience as a team. They are not going to win it but they can have a great time and possibly cause an upset. "They have got two very good props in Ben Flowers and Craig Kopczak, who both would be picked in a combined Great Britain squad if there was one." Wales' World Cup squad Coach: Mark Aston Captain: Liam Finn Star man: Pat Richards (Wing) Appearances: Two (plus nine as Great Britain) Best: Quarter-finalists (2000, 2008) Jamie Peacock's view: "Ireland are in the same group as England and Australia and I doubt they are capable of upsetting those two. But they will be hoping to give them a close game. "It is clear that the other teams in the group, including Fiji, are much stronger, but Ireland will look at this World Cup as an opportunity to give rugby league a huge lift in their country. "Pat Richards is a massive player for them. He has been one of the top three overseas players the Super League has ever had. He's a magnificent player, a great goalkicker and also a wonderful leader." Ireland's World Cup squad Although the tournament is split across four nations, England is the primary host with 20 of the 28 matches taking place across the country. Games are being played in 20 host towns and cities and include London, Cardiff, Limerick and Avignon alongside several venues in the traditional Yorkshire and Lancashire heartlands of the sport. Wembley Stadium hosts both semi-finals in a special double-header, while the final will be staged at Old Trafford in Manchester. Hull is the only place to hold matches at two different venues - the KC Stadium and Craven Park. But the tournament begins in Wales, where England meet Australia at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium on 26 October. As well as the opening fixture, Wales also stages matches at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham and Neath's The Gnoll. France play two of their group matches on home soil in Avignon and Perpignan, while Ireland play Australia in Limerick. "If you look at the 2000 World Cup [which was staged across the UK, Ireland and France] it was a struggle. We went to a lot of football grounds and that wasn't very successful," added Johnson. "So we've looked at it very closely this time and we think we've got the blend just right. The big games are in big places: the Millennium Stadium, Wembley, Old Trafford. Old Trafford does a great job for us with the Super League Grand Final being held there every year so that was a no-brainer. "A double-header at Wembley will be fantastic, and we had to have a marquee venue for the opener and you can't do better than Cardiff. After that we go to the heartlands, areas where we know our fans will come out. "But we're also going to areas where the game is developing, places like Bristol, Limerick and the two games in France. So it's a really good spread for everybody." Australia have dominated the competition since its inception in 1954, winning nine of the 13 tournaments, and begin as overwhelming favourites to regain the title this year. France were the driving force behind the World Cup's creation and hosted the inaugural four-team event, which also included Australia, New Zealand and Great Britain. But they were defeated in the final by Great Britain in front of an expectant Parisian crowd. The next five World Cups, which took place in 1957, 1960, 1968, 1970 and 1972, featured the same four nations. Australia and Great Britain dominated - winning three times and twice respectively - within varied formats. The original trophy - which will be the one presented to the tournament winners - was stolen during the 1970 competition while on public display at Bradford's Midland Hotel and was not found again until 1990. The competition was revamped in 1975, becoming a five-team tournament with Great Britain splitting into England and Wales and the action being played over eight months as part of a "World Series". It returned to the previous format in 1977 as Australia defended their crown, before another overhaul - including the addition of Papua New Guinea - saw matches stretched over three years between 1985-1988 and 1989-1992. The unstoppable Kangaroos won both, including a 10-6 victory over Great Britain in front of a World Cup record crowd of 73,361 at Wembley in 1992. In 1995, to mark the centenary of rugby league's birth, an innovative new structure was adopted. The number of teams doubled to 10, with Fiji, Tonga, Samoa and South Africa participating for the first time. Australia's continued their dominance and also added the 16-nation version in 2000, when Lebanon, Russia, Ireland, Scotland and the Cook Islands made their bows. But the Kangaroos were denied a seventh straight title when Antipodean rivals New Zealand upset the odds in 2008. The All Blacks lifted the trophy for the first time after an epic final against Australia in Brisbane. </body>

      <title>Ferguson exit not to blame - Moyes</title>

      <body>Manchester United boss David Moyes has rejected claims that the Premier League champions have lost their fear factor since he succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson. United are eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal after being held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton at Old Trafford on Saturday. "Sir Alex Ferguson has a great history and his experience will always work in charge of any team," said Moyes. "But the fear comes from the team on the pitch." United have only one victory from four league games at Old Trafford since Ferguson's retirement, but Moyes insisted: "The players have always been the people that have to turn out and do it." Ferguson, who won 38 trophies during 26 years in charge, watched from the stands in his new role as a club director, but United could not build on their win at Sunderland last time out. Moyes had looked on course to record back-to-back league victories for the first time as United boss, only for Adam Lallana's late goal to cancel out Robin van Persie's first-half strike. "I am disappointed because we wanted to get a bit of momentum going and we weren't able to do that," said Moyes. "We had the opportunities to get the game finished off. I am disappointed to lose a goal so late on. "While it was 1-0, there was always the chance that Southampton might get something. I thought we had just about seen it out, then they got the corner late on. "We didn't do well enough [from the corner]. We will work on it and make sure we do it. We have got to do better in the final bit as well, the set piece, defend it and be harder to score against than we were." United are eighth with 11 points from eight games - the same tally as newly-promoted Hull. It is United's worst start to a league campaign for 24 years. Midfielder Michael Carrick said: "It is not easy reading now. Looking at the table as it is now is not something we are used to. "It is frustrating because things are not going the way we want. But as players we have to stand up, take responsibility and get better. "We are still confident. Everything is in place but for some reason, at the moment, we are not quite clicking and not quite firing." </body>

      <body>Assistant referee David Bryan was hit by a flare thrown from the crowd during Aston Villa's game with Tottenham Hotspur at Villa Park on Sunday. Bryan was struck on the back of the neck moments after Andros Townsend gave Spurs the lead in the first half. He was able to continue without treatment, though smoke from the flare delayed the restart of the game. In May, a 15-year-old boy suffered lung damage from a smoke bomb thrown during Villa's game at Wigan. The boy needed hospital treatment, while two women, aged 22 and 24, also required attention for the affects of the device lit during the 2-2 draw. In August, Policing Minister Damian Green warned that fans  who smuggled flares and smoke bombs into games were putting the lives of other supporters at risk. The Government's warning over the devices said they could burn as hot as 1,600 degrees Celsius for as long as an hour. In February, a 14-year-old boy was killed by a flare thrown by supporters during a South American Libertadores Cup match in Oruro, Bolivia. </body>

      <title>JP Morgan 'faces record $13bn fine'</title>
      <description>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports say.</description>

      <body>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports have said. A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials. The fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007. If confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company. Last month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the "London Whale" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil. The tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision. The New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment. But the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims. The $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners. In the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks. These special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports. When the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments. What JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value. JP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said. The bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors. JP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately. Once the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn. The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs. </body>

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>
      <description>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners on the Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <title>Call for whistle-blowing inquiry</title>
      <description>The government should launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, Tory MP and health select committee member Charlotte Leslie says.</description>

      <body>Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, MP Charlotte Leslie has said. The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 2011. That was "an indictment of our system", Ms Leslie told BBC Radio 5 live. The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistle-blowers later this year. On Friday, at an inquest into 19 deaths at Orchid View, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with "institutionalised abuse". She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Martin, who first told police about problems at the home, told 5 live on Saturday: "I do want to work back in care but I can't get a job in the care industry again. "Where I live is a very small village, next to Copthorne - everyone knows what went on. "It's just been an absolute nightmare for me. "Obviously I know, morally, that I did the right things. "Whether I would ever do that again - I probably wouldn't because it's had a huge impact on my life." Conservative MP Ms Leslie, who is also a member of the health select committee, told 5 live's Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martin's experience was "absolutely appalling but sadly it's becoming a recurring theme". "Whistle-blowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing, stand up and save lives, in many cases. "And then other future employers look at them and, instead of saying, 'thank goodness - here's someone who can prevent bad things happening', they look at them and say 'here's a troublemaker'. "People who are saving lives are losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods and everything." She added: "That's why I think a whistle-blowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistle-blowing isn't needed - because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistle-blowing - and how you can protect whistle-blowers." A spokesperson for the Department of Health (DoH) said staff in the health and social care sectors "should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable". "Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to," they added. The department said that, later this year, it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients. Its response to the inquiry would "lay out how we plan on making sure whistle-blowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management". That would form "a key part of the effort to build the safe, effective and compassionate culture that patients, the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect", the spokesperson added. </body>

      <title>National teacher strike may go ahead</title>
      <description>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with plans for a one-day national strike before Christmas if the dispute is not resolved.</description>

      <body>Teaching unions say they will press ahead with a one-day national strike before Christmas if a dispute over pay, pensions and jobs is not resolved. Nearly 3,500 schools were closed or partially closed on Thursday in London, Cumbria, and the South East, North East and South West of England. This was the third in a rolling campaign of regional walk-outs. A national strike would include Wales, as teachers' pay and conditions are determined by Westminster. Teachers are angry about the introduction of performance related pay and changes which mean they will have to work until they are at least 65 to be eligible for a full pension, rising to 68 for those born after 1978, say the unions. They also complain of excessive workloads, changes to their working conditions and job cuts. Teachers in the Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber region walked out on 1 October. This followed a strike across the North West on 27 June. So far Wales has not been affected by the strikes. Teachers in Northern Ireland and Scotland deal with their devolved governments on pay and conditions and so will remain unaffected by this dispute. The NASUWT says it is considering its next steps but it is likely that the planned one-day national strike will go ahead if the government does not address its concerns. The union's general secretary Chris Keates said: "The rolling programme of strike action has commanded support from the overwhelming majority of teachers. "The Secretary of State can no longer claim that the majority of teachers support his reforms. Teachers' anger and frustration is much in evidence and he now needs to begin to seriously address their concerns. "The NASUWT National Action Committee is keeping matters under review." The government restated its disappointment that the unions were striking over measures to allow head teachers to pay good teachers more. A spokeswoman for the Department for Education said only around a quarter of schools in the targeted regions were closed on Thursday, compared with 60% who walked out in the national strikes of November 2011. The government says that it has met the unions frequently to discuss their concerns and will continue to do so. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>'Electronic blood' computer tested</title>
      <description>A new brain-inspired computing device powered via a liquid instead of through wires has been demonstrated at IBM's Zurich laboratory.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24571219</url>
      <date>1382115902</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70552000/jpg/_70552415_8549310302_50612fbc36_c.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>IBM has unveiled a prototype of a new brain-inspired computer powered by what it calls "electronic blood". The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>Scientists are asking people to report sightings of Spanish slugs, to see how much of a threat they are to Britain. The Spanish slug is much larger, and more resistant to slug pellets than species native to the UK. Tristan Maclean, a scientist from the John Innes Centre in Norwich, explains how they differ from ordinary slugs. </body>

      <body>A new stage musical by the writer of Calendar Girls has won two prizes at the UK Theatre Awards, which reward the best of British regional theatre. This Is My Family by Tim Firth, which opened at the Sheffield Crucible in June, was named best musical. The cast included Sian Phillips, who won best supporting performance. Other winners included actress Cush Jumbo, who won best performance in a play for her role as Nora in A Doll's House at Manchester's Royal Exchange. Janie Dee, who starred in Hello, Dolly! at the Leicester Curve, picked up the award for best performance in a musical. Sheffield Theatres, which runs the city's Crucible and Lyceum venues, scooped a total of four awards, including the two for This Is My Family. The musical tells the story of two teenage children, a stressed mum and dad, a bawdy aunt and a forgetful grandmother, played by Phillips, who end up on a disastrous camping holiday. The songs and script were written by Firth, whose past credits include the Madness musical Our House and the Kinky Boots film script as well as the Calendar Girls movie. The other winning Sheffield productions were a stage version of the hit film The Full Monty, which won best touring production, and Mike Bartlett's drama Bull, which was named best new play. In other categories, the award for best children's show was shared between The Borrowers at Northern Stage in Newcastle and Mister Holgado by Unicorn Theatre in London. Blanche McIntyre was named best director for her take on Chekhov's The Seagull, while the prize for best design went to Jonathan Fensom and Charles Balfour for World War I story The Accrington Pals at the Royal Exchange. Wendy Houstoun was awarded the prize for achievement in dance for her "insightful, funny" solo show 50 Acts, while the achievement in opera award went to Welsh National Opera Lulu and Lohengrin. Actor Simon Callow received The Stage award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at the ceremony at the London Guildhall. Professional productions across the UK were eligible, with the exception of West End shows and National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company productions in London. The accolade for most welcoming theatre, which was decided by a public vote, went to Exeter's 60-seat Bike Shed Theatre. The winner was chosen by dividing the number of votes for each theatre by its capacity. </body>

      <title>Where the penalty for miscarriage is jail</title>

      <body>El Salvador has one of the toughest anti-abortion laws in the world. A side-effect is that women who suffer miscarriages are sometimes suspected of inducing an abortion - and can even be jailed for murder. Glenda Xiomara Cruz was crippled by abdominal pain and heavy bleeding in the early hours of 30 October 2012. The 19-year-old from Puerto El Triunfo, eastern El Salvador, went to the nearest public hospital where doctors said she had lost her baby. It was the first she knew about the pregnancy as her menstrual cycle was unbroken, her weight practically unchanged, and a pregnancy test in May 2012 had been negative. Four days later she was charged with aggravated murder - intentionally murdering the 38-to-42 week foetus - at a court hearing she was too sick to attend. The hospital had reported her to the police for a suspected abortion. After two emergency operations and three weeks in hospital she was moved to Ilopango women's prison on the outskirts of the capital San Salvador. Then last month she was sentenced to 10 years in jail, the judge ruling that she should have saved the baby's life. Her lawyer, Dennis Munoz Estanley, says the legal system has an inbuilt "presumption of guilt" making it hard for women to prove their innocence. "She is yet another innocent victim of our unjust and discriminatory legal system which jails poor, young women who suffer obstetric complications for murder on the most flimsy evidence," he says. Xiomara's father describes the conviction as a "terrible injustice". He testified in court that his daughter had endured years of domestic violence at the hands of her partner. And yet the prosecution - which sought a 50-year jail term - relied heavily on this man's allegation that she had intentionally killed the foetus. Xiomara has not seen her four-year-old daughter since the miscarriage. El Salvador is one of five countries with a total ban on abortion, along with Nicaragua, Chile, Honduras and Dominican Republic. Since 1998, the law has allowed no exceptions - even if a woman is raped, her life is at risk or the foetus is severely deformed. More than 200 women were reported to the police between 2000 and 2011, of whom 129 were prosecuted and 49 convicted - 26 for murder (with sentences of 12 to 35 years) and 23 for abortion, according to research by Citizens' Group for the Decriminalization of Abortion. Seven more have been convicted since 2012. The study underlines that these women are overwhelmingly poor, unmarried and poorly educated - and they are usually denounced by public hospital staff. Not a single criminal case originated from the private health sector where thousands of abortions are believed to take place annually. Munoz has worked with 29 of the incarcerated women, helping secure the early release of eight. "Only one intentionally induced an abortion, the other 28 suffered natural obstetric complications but were jailed for murder without any direct evidence," he says. Last year when Maria Teresa Rivera suffered a miscarriage, she was sentenced to 40 years in jail for aggravated murder. Like Xiomara, Teresa, 28, had no pregnancy symptoms before sudden severe pain and bleeding, and was reported to police by the public hospital where she had sought emergency help. The scientific evidence was flimsy, according to Munoz who will soon lodge an appeal, and the prosecution relied heavily on a colleague of hers, who testified that Rivera had said she "might be" pregnant a full 11 months before the miscarriage. A textile factory worker, she was the family's only breadwinner and her eight-year-old son is now living in dire poverty with his grandmother. Cristina Quintanilla's story is different. On 24 October 2004, the 18-year-old from rural San Miguel was seven months pregnant with her second child, living with her mother in the capital to be near a hospital for the birth. Her boyfriend was working in the US, but the couple were excited buying baby clothes and saving food tokens. "Around midnight I felt an immense pain, I thought I was dying," Quintanilla says. "I was banging on the bathroom door to get my mum's attention when I felt the baby drop out. The next thing I remember is waking up in hospital." Her mother called the police - a typical step for Salvadorans in an emergency, who took them to hospital. Quintanilla was given an anaesthetic, and interrogated when she came round. Then she was handcuffed to the hospital bed, charged with manslaughter and transferred to a police cell. The first judge dismissed the case, but the prosecution appealed, upgrading the charge to aggravated murder. Quintanilla was found guilty and sentenced to 30 years in jail, where she was vilified as a child killer. Her son Daniel, then only four, spent four years living with his great-grandmother until Munoz succeeded in having the sentence reduced to three years. "The medical reports couldn't explain why the baby died, but the prosecutor made me out to be a criminal who could have saved my baby even though I had passed out in pain," she says. "I will never understand why they did this to me, I lost four years of my life and still don't know why I lost my baby." Morena Herrera from Citizens' Association for the Decriminalization of Abortion says these cases have had a chilling effect, with many pregnant poor women who suffer miscarriages or complications during pregnancy "too afraid to seek medical help". "I would be terrified to go a public hospital as there is no benefit of doubt given to young women, we are presumed guilty and jailed," says Bessy Ramirez, 27, from San Salvador. "We cannot even rely on health staff to put their prejudices aside and treat us confidentially." The strict abortion law has other serious human rights implications. Suicide was the most common cause of death in 2011 among 10-to-19-year-old girls, half of whom were pregnant, according to Health Ministry figures. It was also the third most common cause of maternal mortality. Earlier this year, the plight of lupus sufferer Beatriz, 22, attracted international condemnation after the Supreme Court refused to authorise an abortion, even though her life was at risk and the foetus too deformed to be viable. Beatriz's health deteriorated while the court deliberated for several months. She gave birth at 27 weeks. The baby died within hours. Individual members of the current FMLN government, particularly Health Minister Maria Isabel Rodriguez, criticised the abortion law during the controversy over Beatriz's case. But the government has made no attempt to repeal or relax the law since coming to power in 2009, as it remains popular with large parts of the conservative population, who revere the Church and pro-life religious groups such as Si a la Vida (Yes to Life). The Arena Party, which is strongly allied with the Church, is favourite to win next year's General Election. But Esther Major, Amnesty International's El Salvador expert, describes the country's abortion law as "cruel and discriminatory". "Women and girls end up in prison for being unwilling, or simply tragically unable, to carry the pregnancy to term," she says. "It makes seeking hospital treatment for complications during pregnancy, including a miscarriage, a dangerous lottery. "It cannot be in the interests of society to criminalise women and girls in this way." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</title>
      <description>The deadliest poisons are often central to the most important medicines, as Michael Mosley explains.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24551945</url>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <body>A boy of 14 and an 18-year-old man arrested in connection with three sexual assaults near the University of Manchester have been released. They must return to a police station later for further questioning, Greater Manchester Police said. Officers had earlier released an e-fit of a boy, who they said could have been as young as 12, who they believed may have carried out the attacks. The police said they would continue to investigate the "appalling incidents". In the first incident, a 27-year-old was approached from behind and grabbed in Lloyd Street North at 18:15 BST. The woman screamed and the offender, who was described as being in his mid-teens and mixed race, threatened her. He grabbed her again before running away. The next incident followed minutes later when a 21-year-old woman was approached by a boy who made lewd comments as she left John Rylands University Library and walked along Oxford Road. She carried on walking on to Moss Lane East and was sexually assaulted by her assailant. The third attack took place at the Manchester Science Park in Lloyd Street North at about 14:15 BST on 5 October. A 32-year-old woman was using her mobile phone when she was approached by two young boys. She was sexually assaulted by one of the boys, who was described as being slim, Asian, wearing baggy trousers and carrying a rucksack, and aged about 12 or 13 years old. She pushed him away but he sexually assaulted her again before running off towards Pencroft Way with the second young boy, who was also described as being Asian. Det Ch Insp Colin Larkin thanked members of the public and the media "for their support and the information they have provided". He said he wanted to reassure the community that officers would "continue to investigate these appalling incidents so we so can establish all the facts and who is responsible". He added that he would like anyone who had any more information about the three attacks or any other incidents to come forward. </body>

      <body>Hundreds of workers at the Grangemouth refinery have held a rally outside the plant amid the continuing dispute which has seen the plant go into shutdown. It comes as First Minister Alex Salmond urged operators Ineos to "fire up the plant and do it now". Ineos has asked the Unite union to make a commitment to call no further industrial action this year. Unite said it would agree, but on the condition that Ineos would not impose cuts planned for the same period. Management and unions failed to reach a deal on Friday which could see operations restart. The plant was shut down last week as a result of the dispute, which came close to industrial action by the union. Speaking on the BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland programme, Mr Salmond said: "I think Unite should give a no strike - without strings - guarantee. "Once that is done Ineos should fire up the plant and then the various discussions, negotiations, consultations on terms and conditions, should take place against the background of a working plant, not a plant that is lying cold." He added: "Let's get the plant up and running so that everybody has a vested interest in coming to terms in a plant that is working, as opposed to this current situation, which is wholly dangerous for the workforce and the Scottish economy, of a plant that is lying cold." Pat Rafferty, Unite's Scottish secretary, said: "Rather than demonstrating, workers want to be working to make sure that Grangemouth has a successful future. Instead their livelihoods are being thrown into turmoil because of Ineos' irresponsibility which risks the future of the site. "Anger is growing among workers and the company now risks destroying good Scottish jobs and a powerhouse of the Scottish economy." He added: "Once again I call on Ineos to drop the cynical blackmail, start the plant up and talk seriously about securing a future for Grangemouth." Unite has published a strongly-worded advert in a number of Scottish Sunday newspapers titled: "A message to the people of Scotland". It described Grangemouth as the "powerhouse" of Scotland's economy and urged management to open the plant. The advert said: "This climate of fear has been created to try to force working men and women into signing away their rights and the pensions which they have saved all their working lives. "This is a company out of control. This is holding Scotland to ransom." The advert asked people to support the workforce and contact MPs and MSPs. Ineos said the dispute had cost it £20m on top of monthly losses of £10m. The company has warned that the plant would close in 2017 without fresh investment and changes to workers' terms and conditions. It has put forward a survival plan for the site and asked workers to back changes to their contracts and conditions as part of the proposals by 18:00 on Monday ahead of a shareholders meeting on Tuesday. In an interview with the Sunday Times, Ineos chairman Jim Ratcliffe said the fate of the Grangemouth site rested with the workforce. He said: "This is not a bluff. The clock is ticking, Grangemouth could have a future but that is absolutely in the hands of the workers." Gordon Grant, Ineos site manager at Grangemouth, said: "We have to address the facts and the facts are that we need the survival plan to have a long-term future, a very, very good long-term future for Grangemouth, and for Scotland. "That's what we are putting forward and that's what we are asking our employees to support." The dispute that led to a vote for strike action had centred on the company's treatment of union official Stephen Deans. </body>

      <body>A memorial ceremony for an IRA man who died while planting a bomb, killing himself and nine other people 20 years ago, has taken place in Belfast. Thomas Begley was responsible for the Shankill Road bombing in October 1993. He was carrying the device into a shop when it exploded prematurely. The bomber's father unveiled a plaque during the commemoration ceremony which was organised by Begley's friends. A loyalist protest against the event is taking place on Belfast's Crumlin Road. Some of Begley's victims have criticised the commemoration, saying it has added to their grief. The nine other people killed in the IRA attack were all Protestant civilians, including two children age seven and 13. Begley's father mentioned the pain of the people of the Shankill Road as he unveiled the plaque at the commemoration in north Belfast on Sunday afternoon. The plaque states that the bomber "died on active service" and is "always remembered by his many comrades and friends". It also includes a quote from the former IRA leader, Seamus Twomey. The crowd was also addressed by Sean Kelly, the IRA man who was with Begley on the day and survived the bomb. The attack took place on a busy Saturday afternoon in the heart of one of Belfast's best known loyalist areas. Begley and his IRA accomplice, Kelly, posed as fishmongers and carried the bomb into Frizzell's fish shop where shoppers were queuing for food. In addition to the 10 deaths, a further 57 people were injured by the bomb. They included Kelly, who was pulled from the rubble of the collapsed building. Kelly received a total of nine life sentences for his role in the attack but was released early in July 2000, under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. Families of some of the Shankill bomb victims condemned the commemoration when the plans emerged earlier this month. A flyer advertising the memorial, which stated also that Begley had "died on active service" caused controversy when it was circulated on social media. The Begley family, from Ardoyne in north Belfast, have previously publically stated their opposition to the Shankill Road bombing and their son's role in the IRA attack. Last week, the bomber's brother, Sean Begley, told the Belfast Newsletter that his family had not been involved in producing the flyer or the plaque tribute, but would be attending the memorial service to mark the 20th anniversary of his death. Michelle Williamson, who lost both her parents in the explosion, wrote a personal letter to Begley's parents, asking them to call off the ceremony. She told them she had "no problem in acknowledging your loss" but said the unveiling of the plaque to a bomber was "a sick and cruel insult to the memory of our loved ones". Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams, who caused outrage among victims when he carried Begley's coffin in 1993, was asked about the commemoration as he attended a peace conference in London on Saturday. Mr Adams told the BBC: "I think we have to be very sensitive about all of this. Thomas Begley has a family, those families arguably are victims. "One could argue that Thomas Begley is not a victim because he was engaged in an IRA operation at the time," the Sinn Féin leader said. "My understanding of this is that, it is a group of friends and family members who simply want, in a very dignified and respectful way - not in any way celebration or triumphalism or any of the rest of it. "The Shankill Road bombing, we all know inflicted awful hurt upon the people who were killed and those people who were injured. "So I'm very mindful, as we seek to build the future, that we have to deal the the past, and part of the problem for victims is that the past is the present. "It's not going away, so we need to be ultra, ultra careful and sensitive to everybody's feelings in this situation," Mr Adams added. </body>

      <title>Rail disruption during major events</title>
      <description>The first minister criticises the timing of engineering work on the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff.</description>

      <body>The first minister has criticised Network Rail over the closure of the Severn Tunnel during two major events in Cardiff. The tunnel will close for maintenance work on the same weekend as the opening ceremony for the Rugby League World Cup, and the Womex music festival. Speaking to BBC's Sunday Politics Wales programme, Carwyn Jones said Network Rail had not consulted the Welsh government over the closure. Network Rail said it was vital work. But Mr Jones said: "They've got form on this. It's an important point here - when we've got events in Cardiff, why do maintenance work on the Severn Tunnel when those events are taking place? "If there were events taking place every single week in the Millennium Centre, the Millennium Stadium or the [Cardiff] City Stadium, you might say 'okay, there are some weekends when that's inevitable' but for some reason they choose weekends when there are big events taking place in Cardiff." The Severn Tunnel - which runs under the River Severn on the south Wales-London mainline - will be closed for maintenance on the weekend of 26-27 October - the same weekend as the Rugby League World Cup opening ceremony at the Millennium Stadium and Womex world music festival at the Millennium Centre. Mr Jones believes the closures will cause travel problems, having a negative impact on the world-wide image of Wales. He said a similar closure in 1999 caused problems for fans travelling to and from the Wales v England rugby international at Wembley Stadium in London. Mr Jones added that he recognised the need for maintenance and regretted that an alternative rail route was not considered when the second Severn bridge was built. "The big problem is of course that a rail deck wasn't put on the Severn Bridge in 1993 - other countries would have done that - and we wouldn't have these problems with the Severn Tunnel," said the first minister. "Yes it needs maintenance. It's a very wet tunnel [I know] having been through there in a cab of a 125 [train], but let's do it when there's not a big game on in Cardiff." In a statement Network Rail told Sunday Politics Wales: "There is never a good time to do work on the Severn Tunnel and we thoroughly investigated the Welsh government's request. "In this instance, this six-week works package was planned two years in advance and had already been put back a week to accommodate the one-day cricket match between England and Australia in September. "This vital project cannot be put back any further and to cancel it would have a negative impact on services from south Wales to London." Network Rail added it had assured the organisers of the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup that it would not schedule any disruptive work during the period the tournament was on at the Millennium Stadium. Sunday Politics Wales is on BBC One Wales at 11:00 BST on Sunday, 20 October. </body>

      <body>Bristol's British and Irish Cup game at Aberavon was abandoned after 69 minutes after a deep hole appeared on the Talbot Athletic pitch. The visitors were leading 24-20 when the referee halted the game. The ground staff spent 10 minutes trying to fill the hole, which Bristol described as six-feet deep,  but it was deemed unsafe to continue play. The organising committee will decide whether Bristol's bonus-point victory will stand or be replayed. The decision is likely to be announced later this week. Bristol team manager John Harrison told BBC Radio Bristol: "The referee had his attention drawn to what he thought was a divot, which transpired to be a hole which we think was going to some sort of drainage channel. "The fire brigade provided turf and soil to fill it in but we were concerned for the safety of the players. "The referee's decision in this competition is final and he decided to abandon the game. As far as the result is concerned, that has to go to the organising committee." Bristol beat Leeds 21-17 in their opening pool match last weekend, while Aberavon secured a 31-17 victory over Gala. </body>

      <body>Tunisian security forces have killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who are blamed for a deadly attack on a police patrol, officials say. They say at least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of the capital, Tunis. Two policemen died when they were attacked in the area on Thursday. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said the militants belonged to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government and the interior ministry spokesman told reporters on Saturday that the three-day operation "has been a success". About two tonnes of materials used to make explosives were also seized. The killing of the two police officers led to an angry response from security forces when Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh and other senior officials attended a memorial service for the men on Friday. The leaders were forced to leave the ceremony because of the hostility. Ansar al-Sharia has been blamed for the murders of two secular opposition politicians earlier this year. Their deaths also triggered mass protests against Tunisia's Islamist-led government. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. But the latest clashes were significantly closer to the capital than previous fighting with suspected Islamists. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <title>Welby makes detour to Kenya</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury is meeting fellow archbishops from the conservative Gafcon movement in Kenya after making a detour on his way from London to Iceland.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has made a detour of more than 8,000 miles to visit Kenya - on his way to Iceland. Archbishop Justin Welby, who arrived on Saturday night, gave sermons at All Saints Cathedral on Sunday morning. He made the "last-minute" 24-hour trip to offer condolences after the Westgate centre attack, Lambeth Palace said. He is also meeting conservative Church leaders who are in Nairobi for this week's conference of the breakaway world Anglican group, Gafcon. Archbishop Welby was due to fly to Iceland - via London's Heathrow Airport - on Sunday night. In Iceland, he will attend a primates' meeting of the Porvoo Communion, formed of churches mainly in northern Europe. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Westgate shopping centre, in Nairobi, on 21 September. The attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. "The aim of the visit is to offer condolences and encouragement to the people of Kenya and those affected by the Westgate attack and to offer support to bishops in Kenya", a spokeswoman for Lambeth Palace said. The Archbishop of Canterbury stayed overnight at the home of the Archbishop of Kenya Eliud Wabukala - who is also the current chairman of Gafcon - the Global Anglican Future Conference. Archbishop Welby delivered sermons at 09:30 and 11:00 before having lunch with the Archbishop of Kenya and five Kenyan bishops. Gafcon 2013 - the second such conference - will run from Monday to Saturday. The original conference - held in Jerusalem in June 2008 - was organised in response to the appointment of actively gay men and women as bishops, especially in the US. Through the Gafcon movement, conservative Anglican provinces - mostly in parts of Africa but some in South and North America, Asia and the Middle East- have begun to function independently of the official Anglican Communion. Gafcon has condemned those who preach a "false gospel" which "claims God's blessing for same-sex unions over against the biblical teaching on holy matrimony". Lambeth Palace said the Archbishop of Canterbury was unable to accept an invitation to attend Gafcon 2013 because of his longstanding trip to Iceland and because he would be baptising Prince George at St James's Palace on Wednesday. Gafcon leaders have said the archbishop's predecessor, Dr Rowan Williams, was not forthright enough in condemning the appointment of gay bishops. The Archbishop of Kenya told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that Archbishop Welby was "new to us and to the communion". "I think he is interested in connecting with the activities of the communion and the Gafcon movement is part of those very significant activities that he will not miss," he added. "I think it's significant that he has recognised that fact," he added. "We hope things may not work the way they worked last time. "He has been to various parts in in Africa. He has been to Kenya before. "I think he has the experience to learn and also to be able to connect." In March, Archbishop Welby acknowledged that some gay couples have loving, stable and monogamous relationships of "stunning" quality. He told BBC News he had "particular friends where I recognise that and am deeply challenged by it". But he said he still supported the Church of England's formal opposition to active homosexuality. </body>

      <body>Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against what they see as a lack of government transparency and accountability. Police put the turnout at 20,000, while organisers said 120,000 were there. The controversy was sparked last week when the government declined to grant a free-to-air licence to Hong Kong Television Network. Critics of the government have urged officials to give a clear account of why the licence was refused. Organiser Kristine Chan, from Hong Kong Free TV Action, told the Associated Press: "People are feeling very angry about this event, that the government is not really giving us many choices of free TV and trying to monopolise the industry by limiting the licences." Lawrence Lau, a Hong Kong citizen taking part in the protest, said: "They don't have the resolve to make a fair decision. They always suppress Hong Kong people and try to favour the government in Beijing." A spokesman for the city's Commerce Bureau has said the content of discussions made during meetings of the Executive Council were, as a rule, not made public. </body>

      <body>Opposition supporters in the Maldives have staged protests after police intervened to stop the presidential election from taking place. Police prevented ballot papers from being sent out on Saturday, saying two of the three candidates had failed to approve the registry of voters. The elections commission has accused the police of exceeding their mandate The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The first round of the election, held earlier this month, was won by Mr Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president. But that result was annulled and the second round of voting postponed amid allegations of electoral fraud, although international monitors said the process had been free and fair. Mr Nasheed has been leading the peaceful protests in the capital, Male. His supporters blocked a main road, drinking tea and eating snacks in a display of civil disobedience. Protesters spread out banners calling for the election to take place immediately and asking, "where is my vote". The current president, Mohamed Waheed Hassan - who had already pulled out of the leadership race after performing badly in the annulled first round - has proposed that the re-run be held on 26 October. "I hope that over that week, any outstanding problems will be ironed out," he told the Associated Press, saying he wanted to ensure a new president was installed before the end of his term on 11 November. The two remaining presidential candidates - Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen - have been fighting for the re-run not to take place. Late on Friday, they sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they had not had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court did not issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. On Saturday, electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. The cancellation caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process", while a US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the delay "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. </body>

      <title>Germany's SPD backs coalition talks</title>
      <description>Senior members of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) agree a series of economic demands ahead of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel.</description>

      <body>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has agreed a series of economic demands ahead of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel next week. SDP leaders promised the 200 members meeting on Sunday that they would win concessions from Mrs Merkel's centre-right bloc including a minimum wage. Mrs Merkel's alliance won recent elections but fell short of a majority. In 2005-2009 the SPD formed a "grand" coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and its allies the CSU. But correspondents say the experience has made them wary about working with the CDU/CSU again. A majority of the 200 members meeting on Sunday backed a statement agreeing to the start of formal talks. An internal SPD document seen by Reuters before the meeting said the party would insist that 10 demands were non-negotiable. They include a minimum wage of 8.50 euros (£7) per hour, equal pay for men and women, greater investment in infrastructure and education, and a common strategy to boost eurozone growth and employment. The party would also demand equal pensions for the elderly in the former West and East Germany and measures to make it easier to combine work with family life, Reuters reported. No mention was made of tax increases for the wealthiest, which the SPD had campaigned on during September's election. Allies of Chancellor Merkel have said they could live with a minimum wage but not with the higher taxes. The SDP also wants to move away from tough austerity measures and focus more on growth and job creation. It is understood that talks on coalition policies and cabinet posts could begin as early as next Wednesday and could last more than a month. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says it will be interesting to see if the SPD pushes for the post of finance minister in any new government, as the post is currently filled by the CDU's Wolfgang Schaeuble, seen as the driver of Germany's tough economic policy. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats in September leaving Mrs Merkel seeking a new partner. Her options narrowed last week when the Greens announced that talks with the CDU/CSU had failed. At the polls on 22 September, the CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. </body>

      <body>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died under house arrest in Rome last week, is to be buried in a secret location, his lawyer has said. On Wednesday, his coffin was seized by the Italian authorities and taken to a military base near Rome after a funeral was halted amid angry protests. Rome city authorities had banned any burial in the city. Priebke was extradited from Argentina and jailed for life in Italy over the 1944 killing of 335 civilians. "The agreement satisfies the family and ethical and spiritual requirements," said his lawyer, Paolo Giachini, adding that there would be "a small ceremony for relatives" following the funeral. The whereabouts of the burial are unknown but Mr Giachini is reported as saying that "we had contacts to bury the coffin of Priebke both in Italy and in Germany". A cardiologist has offered to have the remains interred in his family's grave near Verona, but the local mayor is said to be against the proposal. The German embassy in Rome has said it had not been contacted by Priebke's lawyer and had no request for a burial, the Italian news agency Ansa quoted embassy sources as saying. Argentina - where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy - refused to fulfil his wish to have his body repatriated for burial beside his wife. Priebke's hometown in Germany also refused to take the body, over fears that any place of burial could become a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis. He was one of the SS officers overseeing the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in March 1944, one of the worst massacres in Italy during World War II. In a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters, 335 Italian civilians were shot dead. Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders. In a video message recorded before he died - and released posthumously by his lawyer - the former SS officer repeated the defence he had given at his war crimes trial. He said he had received direct orders from Adolf Hitler to carry out the massacre. Priebke was extradited in 1994 after investigative journalists from US television network ABC News tracked him down in Argentina. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison. However, he pleaded that he was too old and sick for jail, and was soon allowed to switch to a regime of house arrest. The Vatican issued an unprecedented ban on holding Priebke's funeral in any Catholic church in Rome, but a Catholic splinter group, the Society of St Pius X, tried to hold a ceremony on Tuesday outside the city, in Albano Laziale. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 80 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>The authorities in Mexico have said gunmen dressed as clowns have shot dead a former leading member of a once-powerful and violent drug cartel. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. He and his brothers controlled the drug trade on Mexico's border with the United States in the 1990s. But their Tijuana cartel was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of other leading members. "He was hit by two bullets, one in the chest and one in the head," said Isai Arias, a Baja California state government official. The motive for the attack and the gunmen's disguise were being investigated, he added. The attack took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. The former cartel leader was arrested in 1993 but released nearly 15 years later after spending time in prison in Mexico and the United States. His brother Eduardo was jailed in August in the US for 15 years after pleading guilty to money laundering. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

No group has said it carried out the attack but police told the BBC they suspect Sunni Muslim insurgents. Iraq has experienced a surge in violence in recent months. In another incident, police said a suicide bomber killed six people in the city of Samarra, north of Baghdad. The bomber targeted the house of a senior policeman but he is believed to have survived the attack. Those killed are said to be members of his family. In Anbar province, police said two bombers on foot and another driving a vehicle rigged with explosives attacked the police headquarters in the town of Rawa. The other suicide bombers struck an army checkpoint at the town's entrance and the local administrative headquarters where officials were meeting. It was the second attack in less than a month to hit Rawa, about 75km (45 miles) from the Syrian border. Analysts say more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in Iraq this year. Correspondents say the failure of Iraq's Shia-led government to address the grievances of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority has driven the surge in unrest. Many Sunnis complain of being excluded from government jobs and senior posts and of abuses by security forces. </body>

      <body>Egyptian police have fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of students staging an anti-military protest at Cairo's al-Azhar University, reports say. Students had blocked the main road leading to the campus and threw rocks as security forces drew near. Clashes at the country's top Islamic institution erupted when students tried to take their protest off the campus. Supporters of former President Mohammed Morsi have staged regular anti-army protests since he was ousted on 3 July. There were no immediate reports of casualties at the al-Azhar protest. The campus is close to Rabaa Square where Islamists set up a huge protest camp that security forces raided in August, leaving hundreds dead and sparking days of unrest. A Reuters witness said some of the students were trying to reach the square, when they were cut off by the security forces. There were also reports of scuffles at a demonstration at Cairo University between supporters and opponents of Mr Morsi. Hundreds of people demanding his reinstatement - mostly Muslim Brotherhood supporters - have been killed in clashes with security forces since his ousting. Mr Morsi and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial next month. </body>

      <body>Two convicted murderers who used forged documents to trick their way out of prison in Florida have been recaptured, US officials say. Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, were seized without incident at a motel in Panama City, Florida. The men, who were serving life sentences, had been freed from separate jails after officials were fooled by fake papers reducing their terms. The prison authorities have pledged to tighten up their early-release policy. The two convicts were arrested at the Coconut Grove Motor Inn on Saturday evening, the authorities said. They were detained hours after relatives held a news conference urging them to turn themselves in. Jenkins had walked out on 27 September and registered as felon three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker had been set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after the first convict's release. It is not clear who provided the bogus release documents. The two prisoners had apparently signed on to maintain the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. Officials also verify that felons do not have any outstanding warrants. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge had been processed through standard channels this autumn, officials said. Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department: notably, how rare it was for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons would now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates have been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 fatal shooting of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <description>The fantastical farmers' sheds in demand as holiday homes</description>

      <body>The latest property of choice for holiday home buyers in Southern Italy is not a rustic villa or a rambling farmhouse - it is a former farmer's shed, which would not look out of place on the set of Lord of the Rings. Trulli are the trademark of Puglia - existing nowhere but the Valley of Itria. Round limestone buildings with conical roofs, they are as magical as they are historical. Dotted across the landscape, alone or in clusters, with one cone or even a dozen, they look like miniature rustic fairytale castles - Asterix meets Disney. Originally nothing more than farmers' sheds used to store equipment or animals, the structure is made with the same drystone technique as the low walls that demarcate the olive groves. No cement, just local limestone cut into large, heavy slabs called chiancarelle - carefully positioned to make the perfect water-tight structure. It is said that back in the 1600s, when there was a tax on new buildings, the locals built trulli so they could be dismantled when the inspectors came and rebuilt after they had gone. In between viewings estate agent, Alessandro Melpignano tells us enthusiastically about the trullo revival. They became trendy holiday homes when the Trulli of Alberobello became a Unesco world heritage site in 1996. "That is when the market really exploded", he explains. The first to buy were the Germans, who soon got fed up with break-ins. The British were hot on their heels. "But they have stayed," says Melpignano. "And they are still buying. Low-cost flights to Bari and Brindisi have helped keep them coming." Trulli need renovating every 100 to 150 years. It takes around a month to rebuild a cone and costs about 15,000 euros (£12,700). Do they have experts who renovate and rebuild trulli? "Oh yes," he grins. "They are called trullari. And I know a master trullaro." The next morning I go in search of Giovanni d'Errico and find him, unsurprisingly, building a trullo. If anybody ever looked the part, it is d'Errico, who bears an uncanny resemblance to a Hobbit. He tells me he has always been passionate about trulli, but when he was young, nobody cared about them. "They were mostly abandoned ruins. People saw them as hovels for the poor." "I became a trullaro about 20 years ago. Before that I was a tiler. When I began, there was just one trullaro left in this area. It was a dying trade. Now there are loads of us." I wonder if d'Errico thinks tourists are mad for falling in love with old farmers' sheds? On the contrary, he says he is supremely grateful. "They gave us work and a bit of well-being - they brought our abandoned land back to life. "Even if it has slowed down with the recession and heavy taxes on homeowners, our profession's still growing. I do not make a fortune but I do love my job. It is a beautiful thing that everyone wants a trullo." According to Giuseppe Miccolis, another master trullaro specialising in historic trulli, "the problem is that anyone can set himself up as a trullaro without any formal training or qualification". Miccolis, who comes from a long line of trullari, was born into the profession. "At the age of three, I used to play with the stones. At 14 I started working." He considers his trade an art and a passion. But it is tinged with disappointment and frustration. "It is not just the unskilled self-styled trullari, it is the people who build illegally without respecting our landscape." Nevertheless, Giuseppe is determined to preserve his beloved traditional craft. He has begun taking school children on walks, visiting historic trulli and explaining and demonstrating how they are built. "I am hoping to inspire local kids to develop the passion my family passed on to me. I am going to organise walks for tourists too," he says. "Why don't you come back for one?" My eyes light up.

      <title>The Mary Poppins sequel that never was</title>
      <description>The Mary Poppins sequel that almost got made</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24581937</url>

      <body>Brian Sibley is one of writing's multi-hyphenates. He is a prolific and award-winning writer of radio drama, such as Radio 4's acclaimed Lord of the Rings adaptations. He has written plays of his own and many books focusing on film. The subjects of his biographies range from CS Lewis to Mickey Mouse. In fact, a love of Disney has been central since childhood. At home his walls are plastered with Disney artwork. "In the 1980s, it was exciting to be flown over to LA to sit in script conferences at Disney, working on what looked like a marvellous project - the studio's second Poppins movie." Though the screenplay he wrote with PL Travers was never made, he looks back on the experience fondly. And he's in a unique position to explain what she really thought about the 1964 film. "I first corresponded with Pamela Travers in the 1970s, when I was writing a book about Walt Disney. I didn't get to meet her for a decade but when finally we met it quickly became a friendship. "Since she died, Pamela's been painted as an old dragon but it's not true: I'd go round for tea on a Sunday and she was great company. Writing with her turned out to be an eccentric experience but that was because she remained proprietorial about Mary Poppins. "But why shouldn't she be? - it was her creation. Though Pamela, who was very spiritual, would probably have said that the character had been given to her." The first Poppins film had been a massive hit. "But in some ways it's quite a loose adaptation, " Brian Sibley says. "Her books were really collections of free-standing short stories. The first film used elements both of the original Mary Poppins book (published 1934) and the second one, Mary Poppins Comes Back. "The Disney studio had been very keen to make a sequel but Pamela always said no. One Sunday we were having tea when she mentioned they'd been in contact. She described the latest idea to me and said she was about to reject it." "I said it was a pity there couldn't be a new film - so many people had loved the Mary Poppins character. Pamela said 'Oh I could only agree if I could do it on my own terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust.' And she paused. 'If it were you dear that would be different." "So I wrote a letter to Roy Disney (Walt's nephew, by now in charge) who I had met a few times. This was the 1980s and people still wrote letters. I told him there might be a chance of making the film. After a couple of days I got news Roy was sending someone to London to talk to me. Within a fortnight we were working on an outline." The project was Mary Poppins Comes Back, based on those parts of Travers' second book unused in 1964. Disney contracted Sibley and Travers to supply a treatment which they then set to work to expand. "For months I would sit and talk with Pamela at her home in Chelsea about the ideas I had. Then she would give me notes on what Mary Poppins would or would not do and think. She was very particular, even down to how a line should be said. I recorded her on tape and went away. Of course I then wrote what I needed to write - but I always bore her comments in mind. I would give her my script pages and she would write notes all over it. Some parts came back with 'no No NO!' scrawled all over the page. But she also said when she liked what I'd written." Sibley thinks they managed to find a balance between what Travers had written in her books and what the Poppins character then became in the film. But he also sensed a cloud looming over the movie's chances of getting made - the thorny issue of casting. "It was more than twenty years since the original so who could play Mary? Julie Andrews was no longer in her twenties and she had moved a long way from the My Fair Lady - Sound of Music stage of her career. Disney made an approach but it came to nothing. And who could ever have played Mary Poppins half as well?" Casting the world's most famous nanny was not the only quandary. "In our screenplay there was no longer a Bert (as played by Dick van Dyke). Instead there was Bert's brother, who had a similar function of being Mary's friend and possible admirer. Finding a Bert replacement was almost as tricky as re-casting the lead role. "I remember sitting in a restaurant on Rodeo Drive listening to an executive explain they thought Michael Jackson might be right for the part. Bear in mind this was an ice-cream seller in a park in Edwardian London. Or maybe it would have worked - who knows?" And contrary to popular belief, Sibley insists it's untrue that PL Travers hated the original film. "She may have mellowed in her views by the time I knew her but she knew there were good things in it. When we got down to work I thought it would be a good idea if we watched the original film first so I arranged a private screening. "I asked Pamela how long it was since she'd seen Poppins - this was the mid-1980s. She said 'Well not since the premiere, obviously'. I was astonished she hadn't seen this hugely famous film for more than twenty years. But Pamela didn't have a video or even a TV set. "Throughout the film she gave me notes. There were one or two moments where she said 'Oh that's terrible'. But there were more where she got excited at what was up there on screen. She patted my hand and said 'Oh we must remember that, that's excellent, I like that bit very much...' And that's how we began to build our screenplay." Eventually the sequel fell victim to a combination of inherent casting problems and the fact that new executives were running Disney. "But I treasured my time working with PL Travers," Sibley says. "And we stayed in touch almost until she died. She was demanding as a friend. But she had great wisdom and great knowledge of so many things: literature, life, love, faith. She was prickly and difficult at times. But she was also someone of a towering intellect whose friendship I really valued." </body>

      <body>Balkh province in northern Afghanistan is home to some of the most significant historical sites in the world - its ancient city was even known as the mother of all cities. More than a decade after her first visit, Lynne O'Donnell returns with a group of archaeologists, trying to uncover more of its treasures. Across the far northern Afghan plain, a hot wind blows the dun-coloured dust into blinding clouds, and the women's burkas into blue billows. It is 40C in the shade, and even the small black goats being herded through the sand dunes look sapped by the heat. These are the lowlands of Balkh, where ancient trade routes attracted nomads, warriors, settlers, adventurers and evangelists, who left behind secrets that archaeologists are just beginning to unlock. This area places Afghanistan at the heart of political, economic, social and religious power across Asia, as far back as 4,000 years ago. The last time I drove across the Bactrian plain was in 2001. I had sailed down the Amu Darya river on a barge from Uzbekistan as British and American forces were pounding the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks in the US. I have returned 12 years later with Afghan and French archaeologists to tour some of the oldest, most magnificent and historically significant sites in the world - sites that are shedding light not only on Afghanistan's past, but on the development of human civilisation, from India to China and beyond. The Bactrian plain is the treasure house of Afghanistan's secret history. Across this desert, Alexander the Great marched his army, killed the king of Balkh and married his beautiful daughter, Roxanne. Some 1,500 years later, Genghis Khan swept through and destroyed teeming cities that were melting pots of diversity. The philosopher Zoroaster, founder of the first monotheistic religion 3,500 years ago, lived and possibly died here. Rumi, the 13th Century poet who wrote in Persian, was born in Balkh - and is also, some Afghans like to think, buried here. Camel trains, loaded with freshly harvested cotton, lope across the parched landscape, against a backdrop of mud walls built to stop the encroachment of the desert on the fertile Balkh oasis. The French archaeologists are here to take a sample of the walls which surrounded a huge hexagonal fort, its shape only visible on satellite photos, strategically placed for both defence and water. They dig deep in to the foundations to fill a metal pipe with dirt, so scientists in Paris can gauge the last time the quartz in the clay saw light. For now, they are guessing around 2,500 years. Nearby in Dawlatabad is the tiny hospitable village of Zadian. We can only go with an armed police escort as the Taleban are active. Little girls in colourful scarves run squealing from the communal water pump as I raise my camera. Men in baggy trousers and turbans emerge to greet us from a shady walled garden. I look up, and my jaw drops. Against the flawless blue sky, a sun-baked clay minaret towers over us. It was built in the 12th Century, still nameless, missed by Ghengis Khan and his marauding Mongols - and by most visitors to this corner of the world ever since. In the oasis of Cheshma-e-Shifa, a huge white rock shaped like an anvil is the sole evidence of a city where Zoroastrian priests performed rituals for the thousands of people who lived here, 600 years before Christ. On the altar's flattened top is a well for oil which burned a perpetual flame that would have been visible across the valley. The French like to wonder if it was here that Alexander married Roxanne. French archaeologists have worked in Balkh for almost 100 years, interrupted by wars and invasions and, in the late 1990s, by the Taliban, who believed history only began with Islam in the 7th Century. In fact, in Afghanistan, Islam displaced Buddhism. The Taliban showed their contempt for history when they destroyed the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in 2001. Today, archaeologists are confirming Afghanistan's role in spreading prosperity and philosophy across a quarter of the world for thousands of years. For them, the greatness of the past is an example for the future, and in Balkh they see not the violence of the present, but the romance of antiquity. The original Balkh is one of the oldest cities in history. All that remains is a dusty field surrounded by monumental walls that are slowly being revealed by painstaking excavations. In seven years, about 20 metres of the foundations have been unearthed. Visible from the top of the walls are the courtyards of the modern village. Here washing hangs, children chase dogs, donkeys pull carts, and the hot wind blows up endless clouds of dust. In Balkh, whatever comes next when the war ends and foreign troops leave the country next year, will soon be absorbed into Afghanistan's long history.

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Will machines ever be able to think?</title>
      <description>Will computers ever be able to think?</description>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>David Moyes always knew that following in the footsteps of greatness was never going to be easy. On the approaches to Old Trafford on Saturday, there was no escaping the shadow, the memory. You can now walk along Sir Alex Ferguson Way, past the vast Sir Alex Ferguson Stand and into the bastion of invincibility that Sir Alex Ferguson built over the course of 26 years. Just to add to it all, Ferguson's highly-anticipated book hits the shelves this week, followed by the tour to promote it, of course. Sales for his night at the Lowry Theatre,  less than a mile from Old Trafford, sold out in four minutes. It all comes as Moyes is attempting to impose his own identity on Manchester United and put his predecessor in the past. It is proving, as we always knew it would, easier said than done. When Ferguson retired, United did not just lose a manager, they lost an aura, an air of invincibility. Ferguson was at Old Trafford on Saturday to watch Southampton score the kind of late equaliser for which his sides were famed. Two minutes before the goal came, Moyes had replaced Wayne Rooney with Chris Smalling. At the final whistle, some questioned whether Ferguson would have done the same, would have been as cautious. Others asked why Moyes was failing to extract the extra 10% which his predecessor's force of personality somehow brought out in lesser players and papered over a number of shortcomings in his squad. United delivered in bursts on Saturday. There were moments when Rooney, Robin van Persie and Adnan Januzaj linked up delightfully but they were too far and few between. It was strange to see Southampton dictate for so long - they had 54% of possession, made significantly more passes both around the field and in the final third and had 18 shots to United's 12. For long periods United were insipid, not inventive. The familiar fluency, that cavalier attacking flair that became a hallmark under Ferguson has been replaced by a caution, an instinct to not lose where once United would do everything to win. 'Throw the kitchen sink in the last 15 minutes', was how Ferguson put it. The only side doing that in the final minutes were wearing black and being driven on by Pochettino. Southampton never looked overawed, they played without fear or fragility. After the game, their manager Mauricio Pochettino was asked if the fear factor around United and Old Trafford had gone. "I have never started a game in a fearful way," he said. "But it was strange for me to come to Old Trafford and not see Sir Alex Ferguson sitting in the opposite dugout. "Last year when I came here I had the chance to meet him, it was great. I am sure it is not easy for David Moyes to be under the shadow of Sir Alex. But I think David is a great manager, a great person." United under Moyes have yet to win back-to-back Premier League matches this season and the champions have failed to win five of their first eight matches, losing at Liverpool, Manchester City and home to West Brom. The Red Devils are not used to being eight points behind the leaders after eight games. It should, of course, be remembered that they have endured a run of games that no manager would have fancied. United have a habit of coming good as the season drags on. At this stage last year, they had lost to Everton and Tottenham. Two years ago, they had been thrashed 6-1 by City. Moyes rejected suggestions that Ferguson's force of personality had been a factor in what has been a difficult start to the new season. "The players are the thing because of the quality," he said. "Obviously Sir Alex Ferguson has a great history and his experience will always work in charge of any team. But the players have always been the people that have to do it on the field." There is not a manager in the world that would have found it easy to slip into Ferguson's shoes. That would have found it easy to continue to drive his players to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat and mount scarcely believable comeback after scarcely believable comeback. There was a sense that teams that snatched the lead knew they had angered United, and were always bracing themselves for the onslaught. Without Ferguson on the touchline, there is a sense that fear has dissipated. And yet, Moyes must take great credit for the good things he has done. The courageous decision to throw Januzaj his first Premier League start at Sunderland two weeks ago paid off handsomely. The 18-year-old made his first Premier League start at Old Trafford against Southampton here, and once again showed flashes of brilliance, creating United's goal and almost scoring a second. Moyes should take credit. Another huge plus for United is the form of Rooney and the way in which Moyes is nursing him gradually back to life. Against Southampton he has bristled with vim and vigour and thumped a thundering shot against the crossbar. Even if the result was disappointing, there were signs that Moyes is gradually turning United around after their worst Premier League start. It will take time and he will be given that but the former Everton manager is taking his first steps down a road of which Ferguson came to know every step, for good and bad. On Saturday, there was no Nemanja Vidic, no Rio Ferdinand. It was a sign of things to come, a sign of the task beyond replacing the irreplaceable, a reminder that this is a squad that - although it won the league at a canter - is also in need of regeneration. That process will not happen overnight. But in the meantime, teams such as Southampton will, rightly or wrongly, come to Old Trafford sensing a weakness. How long that lasts will be down to Moyes. </body>

      <title>Making the case for 'Yes'</title>
      <description>Alex Salmond's speech was droll and pragmatic, says Brian Taylor</description>

      <body>Alex Salmond may have lost a few pounds (he is apparently on the same diet as Beyonce.) However, our newly svelte FM has plainly lost none of his comic timing. The gags themselves were modestly droll but the delivery was impeccable. Admittedly, it was scarcely a tough house. No sense here of the Glasgow Empire on a wet Thursday. They were ready to laugh, they were ready to applaud, they were more than ready to cheer. And they duly did all three. There was, of course, substance too: not least the date on which the White Paper will emerge. This document will form the prospectus upon which people in Scotland will be voting (although, as the UK government points out, independence would require negotiation beyond a Yes vote, plus a Bill through Westminster.) Along with the publication date, we learned a little more about that White Paper. It will have two sections.... Mr Salmond said the aim would be to create both a prosperous country and a just society. And certainly he stressed the importance of enterprise, the need to compete globally. But the substance of his address was weighted towards egalitarianism. For example, the major announcement was about potentially enhancing the minimum wage. In part, this matches the Scottish mood which is traditionally more communitarian. But there is a pragmatic purpose too. For Alex Salmond to secure a Yes vote in the referendum, he needs to recruit votes from the dispossessed and struggling, from Labour voters and those disenchanted with politics entirely. Hence this pitch. On which, one might note the debate earlier today in which delegates agreed to examine the economic proposals contained in the Common Weal paper published by the Jimmy Reid Foundation. The resolution as amended noted that an independent Scotland "may wish to adopt" these proposals. As with other resolutions, this was carried by acclaim. I gather that there had been an expectation that someone would challenge this, suggesting at the very least that the resolution might be remitted. The advice, apparently, was that this would simply provoke division - and draw more attention to the issue than was thought to be warranted. To be clear - and this was stressed by speakers in the debate - the Common Weal prospectus is not SNP policy. However, examination of its content with a view to possible adoption is now a declared party objective. Those who are interested can read the full detail on the Foundation's own website. But, in essence, it argues for a Nordic approach to the economy and social policy: including an emphasis upon equality, the prospect of public ownership where justified and a higher percentage of GDP taken in tax (although it is noted further that wages overall might be higher, resulting in a net gain in living standards.) When I interviewed Angus Robertson for our conference webcast, he was keen to talk about Nordic egalitarianism but preferred to emphasise economic growth rather than higher taxation. Memories perhaps of a "Penny for Scotland", the previous SNP proposal to use Holyrood's Tartan Tax power which failed to enthuse the electorate. More of which later as the White Paper emerges. Back to Alex Salmond's speech. This was a potent performance by an experienced politician on form. It was well timed. Well structured. It featured the now familiar syllogism: Holyrood has produced devolved policies in tune with Scotland; by contrast, Westminster generates policies out of synch with Scottish thinking; turn to full independence. Mr Salmond's opponents, of course, say that is logically fallacious. That there is no automatic read-through from devolution to independence, that the Union remains valid and valuable. On to the White Paper. On to the referendum. </body>

      <title>'A significant blow to Dyke's reputation'</title>
      <description>David Bond on how the FA's latest row is a blow to Greg Dyke</description>

      <body>By breaking ranks Heather Rabbatts has delivered the most damaging blow yet to Football Association chairman Greg Dyke's commission on the state of the England team. In a damning letter to fellow board members, Rabbatts complains that she and other directors were not consulted before the first appointments to the commission were announced. But perhaps more significantly she says the make up of the commission does not reflect black and ethnic minorities and says in its present form it is "unsustainable". Ever since he announced the first names on the commission 10 days ago, Dyke has been facing criticism. The first setback was the Premier League's decision not to be represented on the panel. Dyke invited the league's new chairman Anthony Fry - someone he has known for many years - to be on the commission over a coffee in the summer. But Fry, under pressure from chief executive Richard Scudamore, eventually declined. Scudamore told Fry the commission would only duplicate work done in the aftermath of England's World Cup failure in South Africa in 2010. He argued that the Elite Player Performance Plan had only just been launched and that it was too soon to start another inquiry into why the England national team seems unable to match the Premier League's success. The league says it is not snubbing the commission and that it will provide the FA with evidence and support to help it complete its work. But its failure to provide a heavyweight representative has clearly undermined Dyke's marquee project from the very beginning. The second problem - which Rabbatts has made clear in her letter - was the way the commission seemed to be rushed through without proper consultation. The first the FA board knew of the first eight names to be on the commission was just as reporters were being told at the Leaders in Football Conference at Stamford Bridge. Separately, I have been told the names were announced before the commission's remit and terms of reference had been properly considered. Since the Leaders in Football Conference there has been some progress. I now gather that there is a clearer understanding within the FA of what the commission will examine. It will essentially look at the way young English players are developed, breaking it down into three phases. 1. The pathway from schools into academies 2. The progress of those young English players in club academies (ages nine to 16) 3. The development of those young academy players into first team Premier League players The commission will look at where there are blockages and then try and work out solutions. To do this the commission will call on a vast range of data and evidence from clubs, which will be put together by a consultant called Peter Beverley, a former executive with American global management consulting firm McKinsey. The plan is for the FA to compile this data and then present it to the commissioners. It will then be their job to assess the evidence and make recommendations to the board. It was proposed at Wednesday's heated FA board meeting that the commission will produce an interim report before Christmas before publishing final conclusions in March next year. It is an ambitious timetable for such a wide-ranging and deep issue and it risks being derailed completely by Rabbatts's intervention. While there has been some criticism of the names announced so far - Danny Mills in particular - and the lack of a current or recent Premier League manager on the commission, the FA says the make up of the panel is not yet complete. More names could be announced next week. They add that the point of the commissioners is to use their in-depth knowledge and experience of the game to assess the evidence and make recommendations to the FA board. The third and final problem is not including a black or ethnic minority representative on the commission. This is why Rabbatts, whose mother is Jamaican, is so angry. She says it is impossible for the all-white, all-male commission to consider matters of nationality without including someone from the black or ethnic minority community. Kick it Out, the anti-racism campaign group, have written to the FA expressing their concerns, while the former England and Arsenal player Sol Campbell has also been critical. While the purpose of the inquiry is not specifically about race and diversity, Rabbatts and others have a point when they say that any inquest into the way England players are scouted and developed cannot ignore the fact that England is now a diverse, multi-cultural society. One only has to look at the make up the current England team to see that any commission without a current or former black player is a big mistake. Dyke will no doubt try to find someone suitable to join the commission and silence the critics but Rabbatts and others may now accuse him and the FA of tokenism. No-one in football would seriously disagree with Dyke that there is a need to have a proper study into why a country with the world's most widely watched and wealthy football league cannot produce a successful national team. But however one looks at it, the setting up of the commission has been mishandled - and Rabbatts's letter is a significant blow to Dyke's reputation and flagship mission just a few months into his tenure as FA chairman. </body>

      <title>Deadly truck bomb rocks Syrian city</title>
      <description>At least 30 people are killed by a suicide truck bombing targeting government troops on the edge of the central Syrian city of Hama.</description>

      <body>At least 30 people have been killed by a suicide truck bombing on the edge of the central Syrian city of Hama. State news agency Sana said Syrian rebels had driven a truck laden with over a tonne of explosives into a government checkpoint on a busy road. The explosion appears to have set ablaze a nearby petrol tanker, increasing the damage and casualties. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front carried out the attack. "A man detonated a truck laden with explosives at a checkpoint near an agricultural vehicles company on the road linking Hama to Salamiya," the Observatory said. It said the attack had targeted government soldiers, but that most of the dead were civilians. Pictures on Syria TV showed firemen battling to contain fires as black smoke rose from charred trucks and cars. A man who received leg injuries in the blast told Syrian state TV: "I was heading to a school in Salamiya and the blast started. "These innocent people don't deserve this. The scene is inhumane. These terrorists shouldn't be in this country." Hama saw some of the largest demonstrations against the rule of President Bashar al-Assad in the first months after the Syrian uprising began in March 2011. But in late summer 2011, security forces stormed the city and have maintained control ever since. Hama occupies a significant place in the history of modern Syria. In 1982, then-President Hafez al-Assad, father of Bashar, sent in troops to quell an uprising by the Sunni opposition Muslim Brotherhood. Tens of thousands were killed and the town flattened. Meanwhile, the head of the Arab League has said that a long-awaited conference on Syria will begin on 23 November, although this falls short of a formal announcement. Nabil el-Arabi was speaking after meeting the international envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, who is on a tour of the Middle East to prepare for the conference. Mr Brahimi did not himself publicly set a date, saying he would do so after his tour. Mr el-Arabi conceded that there were still many obstacles ahead. Western and Arab government officials will meet Syrian opposition leaders on Tuesday to try to persuade them to attend. </body>

      <title>Australia declares fire emergency</title>
      <description>A state of emergency is declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that are expected to worsen in hot and windy weather.</description>

      <body>A state of emergency has been declared in New South Wales as Australian firefighters battle bushfires that have already destroyed more than 200 homes. The announcement comes as conditions look set to deteriorate with soaring temperatures and strong winds expected to fan the flames in the coming days. The Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, has been the worst-hit region with some fires still raging out of control. State officials say they are the most dangerous conditions in 40 years. New South Wales Premier Barry O'Farrell said the declaration would give emergency services additional powers over the next 30 days. These could include cutting gas and power supplies if needed and ordering mandatory evacuations. "We're planning for the worst but hoping for the best," he said. One man has died - possibly of a heart attack - while trying to protect his home. Hundreds of people have been left homeless by the bushfires. One firefighter, 24-year-old Tim Boxwell, said he had lost his own home in Winmalee, on the eastern edge of the Blue Mountains, to the fire while he was on duty. "I'd been standing watching other people's houses burn and the emotion from that was bad enough. To be hit with your own house being lost was a shock as well," he told BBC's Newshour. Officials have warned that the three main bushfires - two in the Blue Mountains and one near the town of Lithgow - could become one huge fire in the coming days, possibly threatening Sydney. A fire service spokesman said: "We can understand the magnitude of that as it would then creep into the bottom end of Sydney. It's certainly something that we're very concerned about." The foot of the Blue Mountains lies just across the Nepean River from the suburbs of Sydney. Some embers jumped its banks last Thursday, starting a fire at Castlereagh near Penrith. After several cooler days, forecasters are predicting the return of unseasonably hot weather - with temperatures reaching 30C (86F) and higher. The heat wave would probably peak on Wednesday, warned Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons, but there would be little relief in the intervening period. "We've got what would be unparalleled in terms of risk and exposure to the Blue Mountains throughout this week. If you are to draw a parallel, and it's always dangerous to draw a parallel, at best you'd be going back to time periods in the late 60s. "The reality is, however, these conditions that we're looking at are a whole new ball game and in a league of their own," the commissioner said. Mr O'Farrell said crews had carried out controlled burn operations overnight to strengthen buffer zones around the major fires. An emergency warning was issued for the Blue Mountains village of Bell on Sunday morning. Residents were urged to evacuate or to take shelter "in a solid structure when the fire front arrives". Villagers in Mount Wilson and Mount Irvine, meanwhile, were ordered to stay in their homes after fire cut off access roads. Residents of nearby Bilpin were warned that if they did not evacuate, they could be isolated without power for several days. Assistant police commissioner Alan Clarke said mandatory evacuation orders would be enforced in some areas, describing the risk as "far more extreme" than in past fires. "At the end of the day we hope we have buildings standing, but if we don't have buildings standing we don't want bodies in them," he said. More than 37,000 hectares (91,400 acres) have already been ravaged by fire in the state in the past several days. Officials say that 15 blazes remain out of control. Smoke and ash from the bushfires have blanketed the Sydney skyline. Australia's military is currently investigating whether a training exercise using explosives may have started one of the fires. The exercise took place at a base near the town of Lithgow in the Blue Mountains region on Wednesday. In the past, many such fires have turned out to have been started deliberately, and police say they are monitoring dozens of "firebugs" - people with a history of committing arson, the BBC's Jon Donnison reports from Sydney. Our correspondent says the blazes have come unusually early in the season and follow Australia's hottest year on record.

      <title>Tito's widow Jovanka Broz dies at 88</title>
      <description>Jovanka Broz, the widow of Yugoslavia's late leader Marshal Tito, has died in Belgrade of a heart attack, aged 88.</description>

      <body>The widow of the Communist leader of what was once Yugoslavia has died in Belgrade of a heart attack, aged 88. Jovanka Broz joined the partisans led by Josip Broz Tito who fought the Nazi occupation in World War Two. She became first Tito's personal secretary, then his third wife in 1952. After Tito died in 1980, she lived her last three decades in isolation, under house arrest for a time. She was left stateless by the collapse of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. "With Broz's death, we are left without one of the last most reliable witnesses of our former country's history,'' Serbian Prime Minister Ivica Dacic said in a message of condolence. Jovanka Budisavljevic, an ethnic Serb, was born into a farming family in what is now Croatia on 7 December 1924. She joined the partisans when she was just 17, remaining with them until the end of the war in 1945. After her marriage to Yugoslavia's authoritarian president Josip Broz - known as Tito - she spent nearly three decades as first lady. But after he died, she was placed under house arrest, accused of plotting a coup. She lived in seclusion in the Belgrade suburb of Dedinje and rarely gave interviews. Speaking to the Politika daily in 2009, she said of the period after her husband's death: "They chased me out ... in my nightgown, without anything, not allowing me even to take a photo of the two of us, or a letter, a book." Since then, "I was in isolation and treated like a criminal... I could not leave the house without armed guards," she said. Mrs Broz had been admitted to hospital in August in a serious condition, suffering from heart problems. Her last wish was to be buried in the House of Flowers, in Belgrade, next to Tito. </body>

      <title>JP Morgan 'faces record $13bn fine'</title>
      <description>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports say.</description>

      <body>US banking giant JP Morgan is set for a record $13bn (£8bn) fine to settle investigations into its mortgage-backed securities, US media reports have said. A tentative deal is believed to have been reached in talks with senior US Justice Department officials. The fine relates to the sale of securities based on home loans, which led to the near-collapse of the banking system in 2007. If confirmed, it would be the biggest settlement ever paid by an US company. Last month, JP Morgan was fined almost $1bn in the "London Whale" scandal, which arose from huge disastrous bets on the financial markets placed by former bank employee Bruno Iksil. The tentative deal to pay the $13bn fine to the Justice Department was reached during the talks on Friday, between JP Morgan lawyers with US Attorney General Eric Holder and his deputy Tony West, the Wall Street Journal said, citing officials familiar with the decision. The New York Times also reported that the investment bank was nearing the agreement. Neither the Justice Department nor the bank was available for comment. But the reports said that while the fine would settle all civil claims, the US bank would still face possible federal criminal charges being pursued in California or individual criminal claims. The $13bn sum is said to include $9bn in fines and a further $4bn in relief for struggling homeowners. In the run-up to the financial crisis, sophisticated financial products known as mortgage-backed securities were created by many investment banks. These special bonds contained a mix of investments but at their heart were supposed to be risk-free home loans, the BBC's business correspondent Joe Lynam reports. When the housing bubble burst, the value of these assets fell sharply and the credit markets seized up. The balance sheets of many US and European banks, including those in the UK, became toxic and they had to be bailed out by their governments. What JP Morgan is alleged to have done was sell the mortgage-backed assets knowing full well that many of the home loans were in fact very risky. Some of the problems relate to mortgage bank Washington Mutual and investment bank Bear Stearns, two failing firms that JPMorgan took over in 2008. The mortgage-backed assets played a central role in the near collapse of the banking system when banks realised in 2007 that many of their assets were worth a fraction of their official book value. JP Morgan had initially aimed to persuade Justice Department officials to drop the criminal investigation but the attorney general ruled that out, reports said. The bank is not alone in facing inquiries into past practice. In August, US government officials filed two lawsuits against Bank of America relating to mortgage-backed securities. Bank of America denied civil fraud in failing to disclose risks and misleading investors. JP Morgan has found itself overwhelmed by mounting legal troubles lately. Once the darling of Washington and Wall Street, it reported a rare quarterly earnings loss last week, mostly due to legal costs totalling $9.2bn. The bank lost $380m during the quarter, compared with a profit of $5.7bn in the same period last year. JP Morgan says it has set aside a fund of $23bn to deal with mounting legal costs. </body>

      <body>Thousands of people have taken to the streets of Hong Kong to protest against what they see as a lack of government transparency and accountability. Police put the turnout at 20,000, while organisers said 120,000 were there. The controversy was sparked last week when the government declined to grant a free-to-air licence to Hong Kong Television Network. Critics of the government have urged officials to give a clear account of why the licence was refused. Organiser Kristine Chan, from Hong Kong Free TV Action, told the Associated Press: "People are feeling very angry about this event, that the government is not really giving us many choices of free TV and trying to monopolise the industry by limiting the licences." Lawrence Lau, a Hong Kong citizen taking part in the protest, said: "They don't have the resolve to make a fair decision. They always suppress Hong Kong people and try to favour the government in Beijing." A spokesman for the city's Commerce Bureau has said the content of discussions made during meetings of the Executive Council were, as a rule, not made public. </body>

      <body>Five suicide bombers have attacked government buildings in Iraq's western Anbar province killing two policemen and three officials, police say. At least 20 people were injured. No group has said it carried out the attack but police told the BBC they suspect Sunni Muslim insurgents. Iraq has experienced a surge in violence in recent months. In another incident, police said a suicide bomber killed six people in the city of Samarra, north of Baghdad. The bomber targeted the house of a senior policeman but he is believed to have survived the attack. Those killed are said to be members of his family. In Anbar province, police said two bombers on foot and another driving a vehicle rigged with explosives attacked the police headquarters in the town of Rawa. The other suicide bombers struck an army checkpoint at the town's entrance and the local administrative headquarters where officials were meeting. It was the second attack in less than a month to hit Rawa, about 75km (45 miles) from the Syrian border. Analysts say more than 6,000 people have been killed in acts of violence in Iraq this year. Correspondents say the failure of Iraq's Shia-led government to address the grievances of Iraq's Sunni Arab minority has driven the surge in unrest. Many Sunnis complain of being excluded from government jobs and senior posts and of abuses by security forces. </body>

      <body>Egyptian police have fired tear gas to disperse hundreds of students staging an anti-military protest at Cairo's al-Azhar University, reports say. Students had blocked the main road leading to the campus and threw rocks as security forces drew near. Clashes at the country's top Islamic institution erupted when students tried to take their protest off the campus. Supporters of former President Mohammed Morsi have staged regular anti-army protests since he was ousted on 3 July. There were no immediate reports of casualties at the al-Azhar protest. The campus is close to Rabaa Square where Islamists set up a huge protest camp that security forces raided in August, leaving hundreds dead and sparking days of unrest. A Reuters witness said some of the students were trying to reach the square, when they were cut off by the security forces. There were also reports of scuffles at a demonstration at Cairo University between supporters and opponents of Mr Morsi. Hundreds of people demanding his reinstatement - mostly Muslim Brotherhood supporters - have been killed in clashes with security forces since his ousting. Mr Morsi and other senior Brotherhood figures have been imprisoned and face trial next month. </body>

      <description>The Combined Maritime Force, under British command, catches pirates believed to have been responsible for two attacks off the Somali coast.</description>

      <body>A counter-piracy task force commanded by a Royal Navy officer has caught a group of Somalis believed responsible for two attacks in the Indian Ocean. Pirates had exchanged gunfire with a super tanker on Friday 11 October before attacking a Spanish fishing vessel three days later. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) traced the pirates' skiffs from Britain's Royal Fleet Auxiliary Fort Victoria. Nine men were caught and forces later destroyed two boats and equipment. Commodore Jeremy Blunden, Royal Navy, Commander of CTF-151, said: "This is an excellent result. "My multinational counter piracy forces swiftly located and dealt with this Somali pirate group, sending a clear message that piracy no longer pays." Combined Task Force (CTF) 151, as the group is known, embarked on board RFA Fort Victoria with support from Australian guided-missile frigate HMAS Melbourne and South Korean destroyer ROKS Wang Geon. The European Union flagship Dutch HNLMS Johan de Witt - flagship of the EU naval force in the area - and maritime patrol aircraft from Luxembourg were also part of the mission. After tracing the pirates an HMAS Melbourne Seahawk guided the warship to their precise location, 500 nautical miles off the Somali coast, before a boarding team made the final approach to search the skiffs. Commander Brian Schlegel, Royal Australian Navy, commanded HMAS Melbourne during the operation. He said: "It is clear that there are still pirates out there determined to generate income from taking merchant ships hostage. "Mariners have been served a timely reminder of the perils of transiting the Somali coastline." CMF is a multinational naval partnership with 29 nation members. Its aim is to promotes security, stability and prosperity across 2.5 million square miles of international waters. </body>

      <title>Hostages freed in Lebanon swap deal</title>
      <description>Nine Lebanese citizens kidnapped in Syria last year return home to Beirut, after a complex hostage deal sees two Turkish pilots released in Lebanon.</description>

      <body>Nine Lebanese citizens who were kidnapped by rebels in Syria in May 2012 have arrived back in Beirut a day after being released. There were jubilant scenes as they were greeted on the tarmac by family members and Lebanese politicians. Two Turkish pilots who were being held hostage in Lebanon were also freed as part of a complex swap. Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized in Beirut in August in a retaliatory abduction. They were met by their relatives and Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after flying to Istanbul on a Qatari jet late on Saturday. A third part of the hostage negotiations - reportedly mediated by Qatar, Turkey and the Palestinian Authority - involved the release of a number of female prisoners being held by the Syrian government. It is not yet clear whether that has taken place. The Lebanese group, all men, were released by their captors on Friday evening and driven to Istanbul, from where they flew to Beirut. At the airport they were greeted by friends and family, as well as politicians and religious leaders. The men appeared tired but in good health. "A whole year passed and each of us never slept more than two hours a night due to exhaustion and too much thinking about what would or could happen to us," one told the BBC. Others described being kept in dark and windowless rooms and hearing heavy fighting. "Our abductors didn't respect us, they treated us badly," Ali Zogheib was quoted as saying by Lebanese media. "We wished that any of them had any kind of values", another said of his captors. One of the pilgrims thought they had been held close to the Syrian border with Turkey. The BBC's Jim Muir in Beirut says it is clear that huge effort has gone into producing the complicated deal. Lebanon's security chief Maj Gen Abbas Ibrahim, who co-ordinated the hostage release, said it had been "difficult, without a doubt". "I didn't want anything from this deal, except to see this sight,'' he said, gesturing at the cheering crowds. The nine Lebanese were among 11 people seized while making their way back to Lebanon after a tour of holy sites in Iran. Two of them escaped. They were reportedly being held in northern Syria by fighters from a Sunni-based rebel group opposed to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The rebels insisted their hostages were fighters with the Lebanese Shia militant group Hezbollah, and were demanding the release of women detainees held by the Syrian regime in exchange. Then in August, Murat Akpinar and Murat Agca were seized from a bus close to Beirut's international airport. A previously unknown group called Zuwwar al-Imam Rida said it had kidnapped them, and that they would be freed if the Lebanese group were set free. It demanded that Turkey used its influence with Syrian rebels to make the swap possible. In response, Turkey advised its citizens in Lebanon to leave if possible. Turkey has consistently backed Syria's Sunni rebels, while much of Lebanon's Shia community supports President Bashar al-Assad. The pilots' abduction sparked protests in Lebanon, and growing concerns that the Syrian civil war was spilling over the border. Earlier this week they appeared in a video broadcast on Lebanese television saying they were both well and wanted to go home. Then, as word came late on Saturday that the Lebanese citizens were back in Beirut, the pilots arrived in Istanbul. They told Turkish media that they had been treated well in captivity. But Mr Akpinar told the Hurriyet newspaper that "first month has been very difficult". "We have been transferred eight times, each time as if it was a new kidnapping." "We chose to have a good understanding with them. And we did, so much that one of our (kidnappers) has even decided to call his new son Murat," Mr Akpinar added. Syrian and Lebanese politics have been deeply intertwined throughout the history of the two states. Syria had a large military presence in Lebanon for 29 years. It finally withdrew its soldiers in 2005, but has maintained a strong influence. The conflict in Syria, now in its third year, has claimed more than 100,000 lives and created more than two million refugees. Our correspondent says that while the war rages on, the hostage exchange creates a small glimmer of hope as efforts intensify to arrange a peace conference in Geneva next month. </body>

      <body>Voters in Luxembourg have gone to the polls in a snap election sparked by a secret service and corruption scandal. Jean-Claude Juncker's coalition cabinet collapsed in July amid claims he had failed to stop illegal security agency activities, including phone-tapping. He had headed Luxembourg's government as PM since 1995, longer than any other elected leader in Europe. But the centre-left, the Liberals and the Greens are now hoping to win enough seats to form a coalition government. With Mr Juncker's image badly dented, there is the possibility that this time they will win a majority between them, putting together a cabinet that excludes the centre-right, the BBC's Europe correspondent Christian Fraser reports. Polling stations in the Grand Duchy opened at 08:00 (06:00 GMT) and closed at 14:00 (12:00 GMT). Early results are expected later on Sunday. Mr Juncker was head of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers from 2005-13. But the coalition government of Mr Juncker's centre-right Christian Social People's Party and the Socialists unravelled in July. Critics at home have accused him of failing to focus on pressing domestic issues. Earlier this year, the parliament reviewed a report alleging the allegations against the SREL security agency, which Mr Juncker oversees. It included claims of illegal bugging of politicians, the purchase of cars for private use and payments in exchange for access to local officials. Mr Juncker has denied any wrongdoing. </body>

      <description>The house in the Netherlands town of Leeuwarden in which WWI spy and exotic dancer Mata Hari was born is destroyed by fire.</description>

      <body>The house in the Netherlands in which exotic dancer and WWI spy Mata Hari was born has been destroyed in a fire. One person was killed by the fire on Saturday evening as it engulfed several buildings in Leeuwarden, about 140km (87 miles) north of Amsterdam. Local media said the victim was thought to be a 24-year-old man who had lived in a flat in the buildings. Mata Hari was born Margaretha Geertruida Zelle in August 1876, to a shopkeeper and a Javanese mother. In the early 1900s she left her husband and travelled to Paris where she found fame as an exotic dancer. Her work brought her into contact with many high society society figures. But she was arrested by France during WWI, accused of being a spy for Germany. She was executed by firing squad in 1917 after a short trial, though her guilt has long been disputed. Several films have been made about Mata Hari's life, most famously in 1931 where she was played by Greta Garbo. NOS TV said dozens of people had had to abandon their homes in the town centre building because of the fire, which started in one of the shops. Fifteen homes and businesses were affected, said the channel, five of which were totally destroyed. </body>

      <body>The funeral of Pakistani singer, Zubeida Khanum, who died aged 78 following a heart attack at her home in Lahore, has taken place in the city. Khanum, who recorded almost 250 songs during her career, was famed for her performances during Lollywood's "golden era" of the 50s and 60s. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif described her as a "national asset". She acted in the film Billoo in 1951 but found fame in 1953 with playback singing, pre-recorded for use in films. She received great recognition from the Pakistani film industry for her playback work in the 1953 film Shehri Babu. During the early years of her career, she also did brief roles in a handful of films including Morni and Patey Khan alongside the late Noor Jehan. President Mamnoon Hussain recalled her services for performing arts in the country and said they were "unforgettable". Born in 1935 in Amritsar, Khanum migrated with her family to Pakistan after the partition. She was the eldest of four children and her talent for singing was spotted at school by her teacher, who put her in touch with Radio Pakistan. Despite her family being against a career in music, Khanum performed her first song in Punjabi. Speaking to the BBC in one of her last interviews, she said: "I always had a passion for singing. I was so happy being in the studio. "They loved my voice". One of her favourite songs was from the hit film Saat Lakh called Aaye Mausam Rangeele. "I loved its music and its lyrics," she added. At the height of her career, Khanum, married renowned cameraman Riyaz Bokhari and left the music industry. She went on to have two daughters and two sons. Khanum spent the last few years of her life using a wheelchair and living with her sons in Lahore. One of her sons is the well-known cameraman Faisal Bokhari. </body>

      <body>Some 6,000 history buffs in period military costume are re-enacting one of Germany's bloodiest battles, the Battle of the Nations. French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated near Leipzig in October 1813 by forces from Russia, Austria, Prussia and Sweden. Tens of thousands of spectators are attending the reconstruction, described as a "reconciliation". However, Church leaders object to the battle being turned into a game. They see Sunday's event as tantamount to glorifying the carnage of war, the BBC's Damien McGuinness reports. An ecumenical service was held in the town of Roetha on Saturday to mark the 200th anniversary of the event - also known as the Battle of Leipzig. The night before, European Parliament President Martin Schulz gave a speech at a memorial to the battle warning of a resurgence of nationalism. An estimated 600,000 soldiers took part in the series of battles from 16-19 October 1813 and almost 100,000 of them lost their lives. The victory of the allies - including a small British contingent - over Napoleon marked the end of his control of German territory. Organisers say their controversial re-enactment is intended to be peaceful and to bring history alive. Many of the thousands taking part have grown period-style moustaches to match their 19th Century replica uniforms. The role of Napoleon is being played by a 46-year-old Parisian lawyer, Frank Samson, who taught himself the Corsican language in an attempt to give a more authentic performance as the French emperor. Local TV is reporting live from the scene as if the battle is actually being fought today. </body>

      <body>Two convicted murderers who used forged documents to trick their way out of prison in Florida have been recaptured, US officials say. Joseph Jenkins and Charles Walker, both 34, were seized without incident at a motel in Panama City, Florida. The men, who were serving life sentences, had been freed from separate jails after officials were fooled by fake papers reducing their terms. The prison authorities have pledged to tighten up their early-release policy. The two convicts were arrested at the Coconut Grove Motor Inn on Saturday evening, the authorities said. They were detained hours after relatives held a news conference urging them to turn themselves in. Jenkins had walked out on 27 September and registered as felon three days later at a jail in Orange County, Florida, about 300 miles (480km) from the prison where he was serving his sentence. Walker had been set free on 8 October from the same prison and registered on 11 October. The falsified documents were not identified until several weeks after the first convict's release. It is not clear who provided the bogus release documents. The two prisoners had apparently signed on to maintain the ruse that they had been released early by a judge. Released felons are required to register as they re-enter the public, otherwise a warrant is issued for their arrest. The registration process includes fingerprinting, images of which are uploaded to Florida police records. Officials also verify that felons do not have any outstanding warrants. Release documents bearing the forged signature of a sitting judge had been processed through standard channels this autumn, officials said. Orange County Chief Judge Belvin Perry said there were several red flags that should have alerted the court clerk's office or the corrections department: notably, how rare it was for a sentence reduction to come from prosecutors. On Friday, Florida Corrections Secretary Michael Crews said prisons would now verify with judges, not just court clerks, before releasing prisoners early. Authorities have been reviewing other releases based on modified court orders received from Orange County, to ensure no other inmates have been prematurely freed. Jenkins was serving a life sentence for the 1998 fatal shooting of a father of six during a botched robbery. Walker was sentenced to life in prison for the 1999 shooting of a 23-year-old man. Walker said he did not mean to kill the man but fired three shots in warning because the man had been bullying him. </body>

      <title>Former US House Speaker Foley dies</title>
      <description>Former Democratic US Speaker of the House of Representatives Tom Foley, credited with reaching across the aisles in a more bipartisan Congress, dies.</description>

      <body>A former US Speaker of the House of Representatives who was credited with reaching across the aisles in a less bitterly divided Congress has died. Tom Foley, 84, died of complications from a stroke on Friday, his wife said. Born and raised in the north-western US state of Washington, the Democrat served in the House for 30 years and was speaker from 1989-1995. "America has lost a legend of the United States Congress," President Barack Obama said in a statement. "Tom's straightforward approach helped him find common ground with members of both parties," Mr Obama said. As speaker, he was an active negotiator in the 1990 budget talks that led to President George HW Bush breaking his pledge to never raise taxes. "Tom never got personal or burned bridges," Mr Bush said on Friday. "We didn't agree on every issue, but on key issues we managed to put the good of the country ahead of politics." Foley also allowed the House to vote on the resolution that approved the 1990 Iraq war, despite his own personal reservations and the objections of many fellow Democrats. "He granted our request for a vote because it was the right thing to do," Bob Michel, the Republican minority leader at the time, said. "He was that kind of leader." But Foley became the first House Speaker to be ousted by voters in his own constituency - as opposed to through a majority change in the chamber or a no-confidence vote from his own party - since the US Civil War. He was defeated by 4,000 votes in November 1994 by Spokane lawyer George Nethercutt, a Republican who supported term limits, which Foley had long fought. That was the year of the so-called Republican revolution led by Newt Gingrich, who became House Speaker in 1995. On Friday, the current House Speaker, John Boehner, called Foley "a model for any speaker or representative". "Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle," Mr Boehner said. After leaving the House, Foley served as US ambassador to Japan for four years. </body>

      <body>A commuter train in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, has crashed at the end of the line, leaving at least 80 people injured. The train failed to stop as it arrived at Once station, crashing through the buffers and ending up wedged between the floor and ceiling of the platform. The accident happened at the same station where 51 people were killed in a similar crash last year. The cause of the accident remains unclear. Saturday's crash happened shortly after 07:00 local time (10:00 GMT). The line from Moreno 40km (25 miles) west of Buenos Aires to Once station, operated by the Sarmiento train company, is normally a busy commuter line during the week, and its trains are usually packed with passengers. Security Secretary Sergio Berni said some of those injured on Saturday had been waiting on the platform and were hurt by flying glass as the train's windows shattered. Jorge Ramirez, a chef who got on the train nine stations before the end of the line, told the AP news agency the accident was "a tragedy". "I saw people hurt, shouting, others thrown on the floor. The people in the first wagon ended up piled on top of each other," he said. After the 2012 crash, the authorities revoked a local company's right to operate trains on the line and pledged to make new investments in safety. But commuters complain of frequent delays and bad service, and it is not uncommon to see travellers crammed into trains on their way to work, says the BBC's Ignacio de los Reyes in Buenos Aires. </body>

      <body>The authorities in Mexico have said gunmen dressed as clowns have shot dead a former leading member of a once-powerful and violent drug cartel. Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix, 63, was killed in a beach resort in Baja California in north-western Mexico. He and his brothers controlled the drug trade on Mexico's border with the United States in the 1990s. But their Tijuana cartel was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of other leading members. "He was hit by two bullets, one in the chest and one in the head," said Isai Arias, a Baja California state government official. The motive for the attack and the gunmen's disguise were being investigated, he added. The attack took place during a family party at a rented beach house in the tourist resort of Cabo San Lucas. The former cartel leader was arrested in 1993 but released nearly 15 years later after spending time in prison in Mexico and the United States. His brother Eduardo was jailed in August in the US for 15 years after pleading guilty to money laundering. Security experts believe the Tijuana cartel is now run by his sister Enedina and her son Fernando, known as "The Engineer", according to AFP news agency. Most estimates put the number of people killed in Mexican drug-related violence since late 2006 at more than 60,000. </body>

      <body>Tunisian security forces have killed at least nine suspected Islamist militants who are blamed for a deadly attack on a police patrol, officials say. They say at least three other suspects were arrested in the operation in the Mount Taouyer area, about 70km (44 miles) west of the capital, Tunis. Two policemen died when they were attacked in the area on Thursday. Interior Ministry spokesman Mohamed Ali Aroui said the militants belonged to the Salafist Ansar al-Sharia group. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government and the interior ministry spokesman told reporters on Saturday that the three-day operation "has been a success". About two tonnes of materials used to make explosives were also seized. The killing of the two police officers led to an angry response from security forces when Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki, Prime Minister Ali Larayedh and other senior officials attended a memorial service for the men on Friday. The leaders were forced to leave the ceremony because of the hostility. Ansar al-Sharia has been blamed for the murders of two secular opposition politicians earlier this year. Their deaths also triggered mass protests against Tunisia's Islamist-led government. Several other militant groups - including al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb - also operate in the region. But the latest clashes were significantly closer to the capital than previous fighting with suspected Islamists. Since the popular revolt that sparked the "Arab Spring" in 2011, Tunisia has seen a rise in attacks by militants. A coalition led by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party was elected in 2011. But some government critics accuse it of being soft on hardline Islamist forces - charges it strongly denies. </body>

      <title>Welby makes detour to Kenya</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury is meeting fellow archbishops from the conservative Gafcon movement in Kenya after making a detour on his way from London to Iceland.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has made a detour of more than 8,000 miles to visit Kenya - on his way to Iceland. Archbishop Justin Welby, who arrived on Saturday night, gave sermons at All Saints Cathedral on Sunday morning. He made the "last-minute" 24-hour trip to offer condolences after the Westgate centre attack, Lambeth Palace said. He is also meeting conservative Church leaders who are in Nairobi for this week's conference of the breakaway world Anglican group, Gafcon. Archbishop Welby was due to fly to Iceland - via London's Heathrow Airport - on Sunday night. In Iceland, he will attend a primates' meeting of the Porvoo Communion, formed of churches mainly in northern Europe. At least 67 people died when suspected al-Shabab militants stormed the Westgate shopping centre, in Nairobi, on 21 September. The attack sparked a four-day siege in which large parts of the shopping centre were destroyed. "The aim of the visit is to offer condolences and encouragement to the people of Kenya and those affected by the Westgate attack and to offer support to bishops in Kenya", a spokeswoman for Lambeth Palace said. The Archbishop of Canterbury stayed overnight at the home of the Archbishop of Kenya Eliud Wabukala - who is also the current chairman of Gafcon - the Global Anglican Future Conference. Archbishop Welby delivered sermons at 09:30 and 11:00 before having lunch with the Archbishop of Kenya and five Kenyan bishops. Gafcon 2013 - the second such conference - will run from Monday to Saturday. The original conference - held in Jerusalem in June 2008 - was organised in response to the appointment of actively gay men and women as bishops, especially in the US. Through the Gafcon movement, conservative Anglican provinces - mostly in parts of Africa but some in South and North America, Asia and the Middle East- have begun to function independently of the official Anglican Communion. Gafcon has condemned those who preach a "false gospel" which "claims God's blessing for same-sex unions over against the biblical teaching on holy matrimony". Lambeth Palace said the Archbishop of Canterbury was unable to accept an invitation to attend Gafcon 2013 because of his longstanding trip to Iceland and because he would be baptising Prince George at St James's Palace on Wednesday. Gafcon leaders have said the archbishop's predecessor, Dr Rowan Williams, was not forthright enough in condemning the appointment of gay bishops. The Archbishop of Kenya told BBC Radio 4's Sunday programme that Archbishop Welby was "new to us and to the communion". "I think he is interested in connecting with the activities of the communion and the Gafcon movement is part of those very significant activities that he will not miss," he added. "I think it's significant that he has recognised that fact," he added. "We hope things may not work the way they worked last time. "He has been to various parts in in Africa. He has been to Kenya before. "I think he has the experience to learn and also to be able to connect." In March, Archbishop Welby acknowledged that some gay couples have loving, stable and monogamous relationships of "stunning" quality. He told BBC News he had "particular friends where I recognise that and am deeply challenged by it". But he said he still supported the Church of England's formal opposition to active homosexuality. </body>

      <body>Opposition supporters in the Maldives have staged protests after police intervened to stop the presidential election from taking place. Police prevented ballot papers from being sent out on Saturday, saying two of the three candidates had failed to approve the registry of voters. The elections commission has accused the police of exceeding their mandate The Maldives has been in turmoil since ex-President Mohamed Nasheed was ousted in disputed circumstances in 2012. The first round of the election, held earlier this month, was won by Mr Nasheed, the Maldives' first democratically elected president. But that result was annulled and the second round of voting postponed amid allegations of electoral fraud, although international monitors said the process had been free and fair. Mr Nasheed has been leading the peaceful protests in the capital, Male. His supporters blocked a main road, drinking tea and eating snacks in a display of civil disobedience. Protesters spread out banners calling for the election to take place immediately and asking, "where is my vote". The current president, Mohamed Waheed Hassan - who had already pulled out of the leadership race after performing badly in the annulled first round - has proposed that the re-run be held on 26 October. "I hope that over that week, any outstanding problems will be ironed out," he told the Associated Press, saying he wanted to ensure a new president was installed before the end of his term on 11 November. The two remaining presidential candidates - Gasim Ibrahim and Abdulla Yameen - have been fighting for the re-run not to take place. Late on Friday, they sought an injunction against the election at the Supreme Court. They complained that they had not had time to endorse the registry of voters - a newly introduced requirement. The court did not issue an injunction but nor did it give a clear instruction for the election to go ahead. On Saturday, electoral commission head Fuwad Thowfeek said police had entered his offices and were stopping officials distributing election materials. Police spokesman Abdulla Nawaz said the election was stopped because the commission did not comply with a court order to have the voters' list endorsed by all candidates. But Mr Thowfeek accused them of exceeding their mandate. "We are very much concerned about what is going on in this country. The Supreme Court decision does not ask police officers to look into the voters' list and check what is there," he told reporters. The cancellation caused alarm among the country's international partners. India's foreign ministry said it was "seriously concerned at attempts to stall the democratic process", while a US embassy official in Sri Lanka said the delay "represents a real threat to democracy in Maldives". UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said he was "deeply dismayed" and called for the democratic process in the Maldives to be allowed to proceed. Commonwealth observers in the country also issued an angry statement denying suggestions by the police that they had sought Commonwealth advice before stopping the election. </body>

      <body>American jazz star Patti Austin has cancelled a concert in Beijing after suffering "a severe asthma attack". A statement on the singer's website said Ms Austin was unable to perform at Forbidden City Concert Hall on Friday night "due to health problems". While the cause of her illness has not been confirmed, it comes at a time of growing concern over air pollution levels in the Chinese capital. The city has recently announced measures to combat worsening pollution. They include taking half of the city's four million private cars off the roads on days when there are serious levels of pollution. The system will be based on a vehicle's licence plate - odd numbers will be allowed on the roads one day, even numbers the next. A statement on Patti Austin's website said: "She was taken in an emergency to the Peking Union Medical College Hospital this morning where she has been treated for a severe asthma attack in combination with respiratory infection. "Ms Austin is currently resting in her hotel. Her current breathing condition does not physically enable her to perform tonight. "Ms Austin is extremely disappointed about this situation since she was very much looking forward to performing." The new anti-pollution system will give out four different degrees of air pollution warning - blue, yellow, amber and red. On days when an amber warning is given, factories will stop production and work will be halted on construction and building sites. Restaurants which offer an open-air barbecues will be ordered to close temporarily, and fireworks will be banned throughout the city. When a red warning is issued, the new car restriction measure will be implemented. Schools and kindergartens will also be closed. The measure to restrict the number of private cars from using the road is proving to be controversial. Critics have aired their concern that those who can afford to buy two or more cars will able to drive any day when the restriction is in force. Beijing has almost 21 million permanent residents, according to official estimates. </body>

      <description>Senior members of Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) agree a series of economic demands ahead of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel.</description>

      <body>Germany's Social Democratic Party (SPD) has agreed a series of economic demands ahead of coalition talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel next week. SDP leaders promised the 200 members meeting on Sunday that they would win concessions from Mrs Merkel's centre-right bloc including a minimum wage. Mrs Merkel's alliance won recent elections but fell short of a majority. In 2005-2009 the SPD formed a "grand" coalition with Mrs Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) and its allies the CSU. But correspondents say the experience has made them wary about working with the CDU/CSU again. A majority of the 200 members meeting on Sunday backed a statement agreeing to the start of formal talks. An internal SPD document seen by Reuters before the meeting said the party would insist that 10 demands were non-negotiable. They include a minimum wage of 8.50 euros (£7) per hour, equal pay for men and women, greater investment in infrastructure and education, and a common strategy to boost eurozone growth and employment. The party would also demand equal pensions for the elderly in the former West and East Germany and measures to make it easier to combine work with family life, Reuters reported. No mention was made of tax increases for the wealthiest, which the SPD had campaigned on during September's election. Allies of Chancellor Merkel have said they could live with a minimum wage but not with the higher taxes. The SDP also wants to move away from tough austerity measures and focus more on growth and job creation. It is understood that talks on coalition policies and cabinet posts could begin as early as next Wednesday and could last more than a month. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Berlin says it will be interesting to see if the SPD pushes for the post of finance minister in any new government, as the post is currently filled by the CDU's Wolfgang Schaeuble, seen as the driver of Germany's tough economic policy. Mrs Merkel's previous coalition ally, the Free Democrats, failed to win any seats in September leaving Mrs Merkel seeking a new partner. Her options narrowed last week when the Greens announced that talks with the CDU/CSU had failed. At the polls on 22 September, the CDU/CSU took about 41.5% of the vote, the SPD won 26%, the former communist Left Party 8.6% and the Greens 8.4%. </body>

      <body>Nazi war criminal Erich Priebke, who died under house arrest in Rome last week, is to be buried in a secret location, his lawyer has said. On Wednesday, his coffin was seized by the Italian authorities and taken to a military base near Rome after a funeral was halted amid angry protests. Rome city authorities had banned any burial in the city. Priebke was extradited from Argentina and jailed for life in Italy over the 1944 killing of 335 civilians. "The agreement satisfies the family and ethical and spiritual requirements," said his lawyer, Paolo Giachini, adding that there would be "a small ceremony for relatives" following the funeral. The whereabouts of the burial are unknown but Mr Giachini is reported as saying that "we had contacts to bury the coffin of Priebke both in Italy and in Germany". A cardiologist has offered to have the remains interred in his family's grave near Verona, but the local mayor is said to be against the proposal. The German embassy in Rome has said it had not been contacted by Priebke's lawyer and had no request for a burial, the Italian news agency Ansa quoted embassy sources as saying. Argentina - where Priebke lived for nearly 50 years before being extradited to Italy - refused to fulfil his wish to have his body repatriated for burial beside his wife. Priebke's hometown in Germany also refused to take the body, over fears that any place of burial could become a pilgrimage site for neo-Nazis. He was one of the SS officers overseeing the killing of men and boys at Rome's Ardeatine Caves in March 1944, one of the worst massacres in Italy during World War II. In a reprisal for the killing of 33 German soldiers in Rome by resistance fighters, 335 Italian civilians were shot dead. Though Priebke admitted his role in the massacre, he never expressed any remorse and maintained he was following orders. In a video message recorded before he died - and released posthumously by his lawyer - the former SS officer repeated the defence he had given at his war crimes trial. He said he had received direct orders from Adolf Hitler to carry out the massacre. Priebke was extradited in 1994 after investigative journalists from US television network ABC News tracked him down in Argentina. In 1998, he was sentenced to life in prison. However, he pleaded that he was too old and sick for jail, and was soon allowed to switch to a regime of house arrest. The Vatican issued an unprecedented ban on holding Priebke's funeral in any Catholic church in Rome, but a Catholic splinter group, the Society of St Pius X, tried to hold a ceremony on Tuesday outside the city, in Albano Laziale. </body>

      <title>UN 'not notified' of Saudi snub</title>
      <description>UN chief Ban Ki-moon says he has received no official notification from Saudi Arabia that it will turn down a seat on the UN Security Council.</description>

      <body>UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says he has received no notification from Saudi Arabia that it will turn down a seat on the UN Security Council. Earlier the Saudi foreign ministry said it had turned down the non-permanent seat, accusing the world body of "double standards". The ministry said the UN needs to be reformed first. It said the Security Council had failed in its duties towards Syria as well as in other world conflicts. Mr Ban refused to say whether he would be speaking to the Saudi king about the matter. "I understand that some member states, particularly some concerned group of member states, are discussing [this] among themselves," Mr Ban said. The reaction among diplomats to this unprecedented decision has been one of shock and confusion, the BBC's Nada Tawfik reports from the UN. France's UN ambassador Gerard Araud said: "We think that Saudi Arabia would have brought a very positive contribution to the Security Council, but we do also understand the frustration of Saudi Arabia." "The fact is that the Security Council has been unable to act now for more than two years," Mr Araud said, according to AFP. However, Russia's foreign ministry called the move bewildering, and said Saudi Arabia's criticism of the UN Security Council about its actions over Syria "is particularly strange". Saudi Arabia has previously expressed frustration at what it sees as an international failure to act on Syria, where it staunchly backs the rebels. The announcement came hours after Saudi Arabia was elected for the first time to one of the 10 rotating seats on the Security Council. The non-permanent members sit on the council for two years, along with the five permanent members - the US, the UK, France, China and Russia. As well as accusing the council of "double-standards" and demanding reform, the Saudi foreign ministry pointed to its failure "to find a solution to the Palestinian cause for 65 years", which had led to "numerous wars that have threatened world peace". It also criticised the UN's "failure" to rid the Middle East region of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons. And it accused the UN of allowing the Syrian government "to kill its own people with chemical weapons... without confronting it or imposing any deterrent sanctions". The UN Security Council last month finally broke a two-and-a-half year deadlock on how to deal with conflict in Syria after voting unanimously to adopt a binding resolution on ridding the country of chemical weapons. Saudi observers say Riyadh would have been working for years to gain a place on the UN Security Council, so such a decision would have to have been made at the very top of the kingdom's leadership. </body>

      <body>Masked gunmen have shot dead a Libyan military police commander in the city of Benghazi, officials have said. Ahmed al-Barghathi, the head of the military police's investigative division, was shot several times as he left his house for Friday prayers. No group has admitted carrying out the attack. Many security officials have been targeted by gunmen since the end of the 2011 war that toppled Colonel Muammar Gaddafi's government. In the past year alone, more than 80 people, many of whom were high-profile military and police figures or retired army generals, have been assassinated in eastern Libya. The BBC's Rana Jawad in the capital, Tripoli, says no-one ever admits carrying out the killings. and arrests are rarely made. Earlier this week two members of an infantry brigade were killed following an attack on their base in Benghazi. Local media reported that their throats were slit. And in the eastern city of Derna on Thursday morning, a local army commander widely known for his role in leading an anti-Gaddafi brigade was shot dead. Mr Barghathi was one of many officials who rose to prominence after fighting against Gaddafi's forces. He was reportedly on holiday in Benghazi when he was shot. "Several shots hit Ahmed al-Barghathi. He was brought to hospital but later died there," a security source said. Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan recently called on Western powers to help stop the spread of militancy in Libya. </body>

      <body>The brother-in-law of a Sheffield man who drowned in the sea off Cyprus while saving a man in difficulty has spoken of the family's loss. Keith West, 50, had been holidaying on the island with his fiancee Julie Davies while the couple planned their wedding there next year. Mr West was caught in an undercurrent on 14 October after rescuing a man. His brother-in-law, Steve Robjohns, said Mr West "would not have hesitated" to help someone in danger. "Keith was an old fashioned Yorkshireman. He was brilliant, he was true, and there wasn't a bad bone in his body. "It doesn't come as a surprise to me that he's done what he's done," said Mr Robjohns. It is believed Mr West was walking along the beach with his fiancee when he saw a man in trouble in the water and tried to help, said Mr Robjohns. He managed to save the man but was then caught by a wave and pulled under the water. Mr West had been submerged for about 10 minutes before a lifeguard found him and he could not be resuscitated. Ms Davies was "badly cut up" about her partner's death, said Mr Robjohns. "She has just had him pulled away from her and she can't get to grips with the fact she's never going to see him again," he said. "It's truly awful and all our hearts and minds go out to Julie who absolutely loved him to bits. It's truly heart-rending stuff." The Foreign Office said it was aware of the death of a British national on Cyprus and was providing consular assistance to the family. </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <body>A fire in Brazil's largest port has burnt some 180,000 tonnes of raw sugar, damaging six warehouses and pushing international prices to a one-year high. The authorities in the port of Santos said it took six hours to bring the fire under control. The cause of the blaze is still being investigated. Brazil is the world's main sugar exporter, accounting for nearly half of international sales. The terminal affected by the fire belongs to Brazilian sugar giant Copersucar. Four other sugar terminals are operating normally, port authorities said. Analysts say Brazil has enough port capacity to carry on with its usual export levels. "International markets react because they know there will be a temporary drop. But other terminals will certainly make up for the accident," sugar market analyst Plinio Nastari told Folha de Sao Paulo newspaper. Sugar prices in New York future markets went up by 6% when news of the fire broke, dropping later in the day. Port authorities said that the fire began at around 06:00 local time (10:00 GMT) on a conveyor belt taking raw sugar into one of the warehouses. They say this is the biggest fire in the history of the port of Santos, which exported 12.8 million tonnes of sugar in the first eight months of the year. The port is located some 80km (50 miles) from Sao Paulo. It was the gateway for much of Brazil's coffee exports in the 19th and 20th century and also the main point of entry for millions of European immigrants who arrived in Brazil until the 1950s. </body>

      <title>China's economic growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's economic growth picks up pace in the July-to-September period according to officials figures - the first rise in three quarters.</description>

      <body>China's economic growth picked up pace in the July-to-September period, the first rise in three quarters. The world's second-biggest economy grew 7.8% from a year earlier, up from 7.5% expansion in the previous quarter. The official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment. After years of blistering growth, China has seen its pace of expansion slow recently and there have been fears that growth may slow further. China has set a growth target of 7.5% for the year. Analysts said the latest numbers indicated that it was likely that Beijing would meet this. "This is an indication that China's economic growth is holding up in a range which is within the comfort zone of both the Chinese policymakers as well as global watchers," said Song Seng Wun, a senior economist with CIMB Research . Over the past few decades China has relied heavily on its exports and manufacturing sectors as well as government-led infrastructure spending to help boost growth. However, a slowdown in key markets such as the US and Europe has hurt demand for its exports. As a result, it has been trying to spur domestic demand to offset the decline in foreign sales and also to rebalance its growth. Earlier this year, it unveiled fresh measures to help boost the economy. From 1 August, China has suspend value-added tax (VAT) and turnover tax for small businesses with monthly sales of less than 20,000 yuan ($3,257; £2,125). The cabinet said the move would benefit more than six million small companies and boost employment and income for millions of people. Policymakers said they would also implement measures to simplify customs clearance procedures, cut operational fees and facilitate the exports of small and medium-sized private enterprises. The cabinet also announced plans to completely open China's railway construction market to private investors to develop the sector further. It said it would set up a railway development fund, with the initial money coming from the government. Analysts said the moves were starting to have an impact on the growth numbers. "There is certainly a build up of momentum among the small manufacturers, which is an indication that China's policies targeted at them are working," said Tony Nash, vice-president at IHS. Factory output rose 10.2% in September, from a year earlier. Meanwhile, retail sales rose 13.3% and fixed asset investment jumped 20.2% during the month from levels a year ago. Tim Condon of ING added that the measures may help China sustain its growth rate in the current quarter as well. "The mini-stimulus we've seen is enough to keep it going at this pace in the fourth quarter," Mr Condon said. However, there have been some concerns over whether the economic rebound is sustainable in the long run, not least due to the continued rise in property prices. Property prices have now risen for eight months in a row, despite government efforts to cool the market. Some analysts have said that China's new leaders, who took charge in March, have so far tolerated the price rises due to concerns over slowing economic growth. According to some estimates, about 25% of overall investment in China goes towards property, making it one of the most important growth sectors. But the continued surge in prices has fanned fears that asset bubbles may be forming. "Between real estate and the lending environment, there are concerns that things may be heating up," said Mr Nash of IHS. "If not addressed properly, and in time, it could pose a serious threat to China's growth." Analysts said that with growth rebounding, Beijing may take measures to try and curb speculation in the property market. "We think the recovery in the third quarter was mainly driven by the strong momentum of the property market," said Shen Jianguang, chief China economist with Mizuho Securities in Hong Kong. "The government concerns about an over-heated property market are increasing, and tougher measures to curb rising prices may be forthcoming. "We expect gross domestic product (GDP) growth will slow to 7.6% in the fourth quarter," he added. </body>

      <title>Ferdinand &amp; Hodgson join FA commission</title>
      <description>England boss Roy Hodgson and former captain Rio Ferdinand are appointed to the FA commission to improve the national team.</description>

      <body>Ex-England captain Rio Ferdinand and manager Roy Hodgson have been named on the Football Association's commission to improve the national team. The appointments come one day after Heather Rabbatts, the FA's only female board member, criticised the group's all-white, all-male make-up. Hodgson last week steered England to the 2014 World Cup finals in Brazil. Ferdinand, 34, quit international football in May after winning the last of his 81 caps in June 2011. The centre-back, who helped Manchester United win the Premier League title last season, is the first non-white member of the 10-person panel. On Saturday, Rabbatts accused the FA of letting down black and ethnic minority people with the make-up of the commission. FA chairman Greg Dyke said in a statement: "Rio's vast experience as a player developed through West Ham's successful youth system, winning Premier League and European titles with Manchester United and representing England at World Cups means he has a huge amount to offer to the debate. "We have been speaking to Rio and Manchester United for some time about him joining the group - before we named the other members of the Commission. "However, as he is a current Manchester United player we needed to be sure that Rio had the necessary time to fully participate on the Commission and not impact on his day job. It has been agreed he does. "As a current player with forthright views and opinions on the game, we can look forward to Rio providing significant insight and experience." Ferdinand and Hodgson join FA vice-chairman Roger Burden, former England manager Glenn Hoddle, ex-England defender Danny Mills, League Managers' Association chairman Howard Wilkinson, Professional Footballers' Association chairman Ritchie Humphreys, Football League chairman Greg Clarke and Crewe director of football Dario Gradi on the panel. Dyke said he delayed announcing Hodgson's appointment until England's World Cup qualifying campaign had been completed. "It is important Roy can offer his views as the current manager of the national team and share the knowledge he has gained when working for many years in a number of countries," he said. "It is important we do not lose sight of the Commission's main purpose. That is - finding a way of delivering long-term success for the England men's senior team, particularly by identifying ways to increase the number of players available to the national team playing regularly at the highest level of English football or abroad."

      <title>All Blacks not unbeatable - Hansen</title>
      <description>New Zealand coach Steve Hansen says his side will remain humble as they prepare for their four-Test November tour.</description>

      <body>New Zealand coach Steve Hansen insists his side will remain grounded as they prepare for a tour that could see them stay unbeaten for an entire season. The All Blacks could become the first nation in the professional era to go through a year without losing. The world champions have won all 10 Tests so far in 2013, winning the Rugby Championship title in the process. "I don't think we've got any right to go around thumping our chests saying that we're unbeatable," Hansen said. "We'll get our feet back on the ground and stay humble and keep working hard. "We realise that if we don't, then others will come past us. That's not what we want." New Zealand have only lost one of their 24 Tests since winning the 2011 World Cup, against England at Twickenham last November. Hansen has included five uncapped players in a 36-man squad for the All Blacks' forthcoming four-Test tour, starting in Japan on 2 November before heading to Europe to face France, England and Ireland. The Crusaders trio of prop Joe Moody, lock Dominic Bird and back-rower Luke Whitelock, Hurricanes scrum-half TJ Perenara and Blues wing Frank Halai are all included. The versatile Whitelock, who will provide number eight cover for Kieran Read, could emulate older brothers Sam and George by becoming an All Black. Bird and Perenara have both previously been named in All Blacks squads but injuries prevented them making Test debuts. Moody, a Junior Commonwealth Games wrestling bronze medallist, is a relative novice, having only played Super Rugby for the first time this season. With centre Conrad Smith unavailable while he takes a six-month sabbatical, Ryan Crotty - with only one Test under his belt - is included among the midfield options. Wellington loose forward Ardie Savea, the younger brother of wing Julian, has been included as an 'apprentice' player for the tour to get a taste of the All Blacks environment. The squad will be led by 120-Test veteran Richie McCaw, who along with eight other senior players will skip the Japan leg of the tour and head straight to Paris, where the All Blacks play France on 9 November. New Zealand warmed up for their tour by beating Australia 41-33 in Dunedin on Saturday to wrap up a 3-0 whitewash in this year's Bledisloe Cup series. New Zealand squad: Forwards: Hookers: Dane Coles, Andrew Hore, Keven Mealamu; Props: Wyatt Crockett, Charlie Faumuina, Ben Franks, Owen Franks, Joe Moody, Tony Woodcock; Locks: Dominic Bird, Brodie Retallick, Luke Romano, Jeremy Thrush, Samuel Whitelock; Back-rows: Sam Cane, Steven Luatua, Richie McCaw (captain), Liam Messam, Kieran Read, Luke Whitelock. Backs: Back three: Israel Dagg, Frank Halai, Cory Jane, Charles Piutau, Julian Savea, Ben Smith; Centres: Ryan Crotty, Ma'a Nonu, Francis Saili; Fly-halves: Beauden Barrett, Daniel Carter, Aaron Cruden, Tom Taylor; Scrum-halves: Tawera Kerr-Barlow, TJ Perenara, Aaron Smith. </body>

      <title>Ferguson exit not to blame - Moyes</title>
      <description>Manchester United boss David Moyes rejects the idea his side have lost their fear factor since Sir Alex Ferguson retired.</description>

      <body>Manchester United boss David Moyes has rejected claims that the Premier League champions have lost their fear factor since he succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson. United are eight points behind Premier League leaders Arsenal after being held to a 1-1 draw by Southampton at Old Trafford on Saturday. "Sir Alex Ferguson has a great history and his experience will always work in charge of any team," said Moyes. "But the fear comes from the team on the pitch." United have only one victory from four league games at Old Trafford since Ferguson's retirement, but Moyes insisted: "The players have always been the people that have to turn out and do it." Ferguson, who won 38 trophies during 26 years in charge, watched from the stands in his new role as a club director, but United could not build on their win at Sunderland last time out. Moyes had looked on course to record back-to-back league victories for the first time as United boss, only for Adam Lallana's late goal to cancel out Robin van Persie's first-half strike. "I am disappointed because we wanted to get a bit of momentum going and we weren't able to do that," said Moyes. "We had the opportunities to get the game finished off. I am disappointed to lose a goal so late on. "While it was 1-0, there was always the chance that Southampton might get something. I thought we had just about seen it out, then they got the corner late on. "We didn't do well enough [from the corner]. We will work on it and make sure we do it. We have got to do better in the final bit as well, the set piece, defend it and be harder to score against than we were." United are eighth with 11 points from eight games - the same tally as newly-promoted Hull. It is United's worst start to a league campaign for 24 years. Midfielder Michael Carrick said: "It is not easy reading now. Looking at the table as it is now is not something we are used to. "It is frustrating because things are not going the way we want. But as players we have to stand up, take responsibility and get better. "We are still confident. Everything is in place but for some reason, at the moment, we are not quite clicking and not quite firing." </body>

      <body>Hammer horror star Sir Christopher Lee said it was a "very emotional moment" when he received his British Institute Fellowship from his friend Johnny Depp. He tearfully accepted the award at the London Film Festival, saying: "I didn't know you were going to be here. I must try and pull myself together." The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. Screenwriter Jonathan Asser won best British newcomer. He took the accolade for his debut feature Starred Up, about the practice of placing violent young offenders prematurely in adult prison. BFI fellow and film critic Philip French said of Ida that the jury was "deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation". Sir Christopher, 91, who described receiving his award as "a great joy", is famed for his villainous portrayals of Bond bad guy Scaramanga and evil wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings. He has amassed more than 250 screen credits, including The Wicker Man, The Man with the Golden Gun and more recently, several Tim Burton films including Sleepy Hollow, which starred Depp. He also played Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Depp, who sneaked into the awards ceremony to surprise his friend, said it was his "great honour" to present the award to "a very great man", saying he had been "fascinated and inspired" by him. "He's been a wonderful individual and over the years I've had the pleasure of working with him and it has been a childhood dream come true," he said. "But as great as it is to work with him, that pleasure doesn't compare with getting to know him and being able to count him as a true friend. "A national treasure and a genuine artist. I love ya!" Sir Christopher responded by saying: "I can't thank you enough," in reference to Depp, who he had been told could not make the occasion as he was elsewhere. He went on : "When I take a look back, and it's a long one, 67 years, at the characters I've played I get a truly strange feeling they were all played by somebody else, and not by me. "And there are a few occasions when it has been the case I wish it had!" He said of Depp: "He means an enormous amount to me. He is one of very few young actors on screen today who's truly a star. "Everything he does has a meaning. He's a joy to work with, an actor's dream and certainly a director's dream. I could go on a long time but I'd probably embarrass him." The festival presented the Sutherland Award, for the most original and imaginative film debut, to Anthony Chen, who directed Ilo Ilo, which explores the life and vulnerabilities of a modern affluent family in Singapore. The Grierson award for the best documentary went to Paul-Julien Robert's My Fathers, My Mother and Me, a portrayal of life in Friedrichshof, the largest commune in Europe, which was founded in the 70s. The film reveals the devastating emotional effects of life there on its residents, and jury president Kate Ogborn said the "disturbing film" raised "larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse". The film festival closes later with the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a dramatisation of the making of 1964 movie Mary Poppins starring Emma Thompson as author PL Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Hanks appeared at Bafta's London headquarters on Saturday to give a Life in Pictures talk, during which he revealed some of the difficulties he faced playing "Uncle Walt" on screen. "Walt Disney died of lung cancer; he smoked three packs a day," the two-time Oscar winner told host Francine Stock. "But can we show him smoking in a major motion picture these days? No way in hell. "It's this thing that has happened in movies - real people can't smoke. We literally had a negotiation over whether I could hold a lit cigarette in a scene." In a wide-ranging discussion covering his 30-year film career, Hanks said his success was partly down to his not having "a bigger-than-life persona". "I'm charming as hell, but I don't strike fear and I don't have a huge amount of mystery," he explained. "You're not worried about me killing you, or stealing your daughter, or being some sort of criminal mastermind. "I view myself as a guy that if I had been a good student, I could be a historian," he continued. "And if I had been good at science, I could be a doctor. "I'm not good at any of those things so I'm an actor. These movies, these roles, they're always something that - if I was a little more accomplished - I could be that guy." Hanks can currently be seen in cinemas in Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival on 9 October. Saving Mr Banks is out in the UK on 29 November. </body>

      <body>A new stage musical by the writer of Calendar Girls has won two prizes at the UK Theatre Awards, which reward the best of British regional theatre. This Is My Family by Tim Firth, which opened at the Sheffield Crucible in June, was named best musical. The cast included Sian Phillips, who won best supporting performance. Other winners included actress Cush Jumbo, who won best performance in a play for her role as Nora in A Doll's House at Manchester's Royal Exchange. Janie Dee, who starred in Hello, Dolly! at the Leicester Curve, picked up the award for best performance in a musical. Sheffield Theatres, which runs the city's Crucible and Lyceum venues, scooped a total of four awards, including the two for This Is My Family. The musical tells the story of two teenage children, a stressed mum and dad, a bawdy aunt and a forgetful grandmother, played by Phillips, who end up on a disastrous camping holiday. The songs and script were written by Firth, whose past credits include the Madness musical Our House and the Kinky Boots film script as well as the Calendar Girls movie. The other winning Sheffield productions were a stage version of the hit film The Full Monty, which won best touring production, and Mike Bartlett's drama Bull, which was named best new play. In other categories, the award for best children's show was shared between The Borrowers at Northern Stage in Newcastle and Mister Holgado by Unicorn Theatre in London. Blanche McIntyre was named best director for her take on Chekhov's The Seagull, while the prize for best design went to Jonathan Fensom and Charles Balfour for World War I story The Accrington Pals at the Royal Exchange. Wendy Houstoun was awarded the prize for achievement in dance for her "insightful, funny" solo show 50 Acts, while the achievement in opera award went to Welsh National Opera Lulu and Lohengrin. Actor Simon Callow received The Stage award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at the ceremony at the London Guildhall. Professional productions across the UK were eligible, with the exception of West End shows and National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company productions in London. The accolade for most welcoming theatre, which was decided by a public vote, went to Exeter's 60-seat Bike Shed Theatre. The winner was chosen by dividing the number of votes for each theatre by its capacity. </body>

      <description>The fantastical farmers' sheds in demand as holiday homes</description>

      <body>The latest property of choice for holiday home buyers in Southern Italy is not a rustic villa or a rambling farmhouse - it is a former farmer's shed, which would not look out of place on the set of Lord of the Rings. Trulli are the trademark of Puglia - existing nowhere but the Valley of Itria. Round limestone buildings with conical roofs, they are as magical as they are historical. Dotted across the landscape, alone or in clusters, with one cone or even a dozen, they look like miniature rustic fairytale castles - Asterix meets Disney. Originally nothing more than farmers' sheds used to store equipment or animals, the structure is made with the same drystone technique as the low walls that demarcate the olive groves. No cement, just local limestone cut into large, heavy slabs called chiancarelle - carefully positioned to make the perfect water-tight structure. It is said that back in the 1600s, when there was a tax on new buildings, the locals built trulli so they could be dismantled when the inspectors came and rebuilt after they had gone. In between viewings estate agent, Alessandro Melpignano tells us enthusiastically about the trullo revival. They became trendy holiday homes when the Trulli of Alberobello became a Unesco world heritage site in 1996. "That is when the market really exploded", he explains. The first to buy were the Germans, who soon got fed up with break-ins. The British were hot on their heels. "But they have stayed," says Melpignano. "And they are still buying. Low-cost flights to Bari and Brindisi have helped keep them coming." Trulli need renovating every 100 to 150 years. It takes around a month to rebuild a cone and costs about 15,000 euros (£12,700). Do they have experts who renovate and rebuild trulli? "Oh yes," he grins. "They are called trullari. And I know a master trullaro." The next morning I go in search of Giovanni d'Errico and find him, unsurprisingly, building a trullo. If anybody ever looked the part, it is d'Errico, who bears an uncanny resemblance to a Hobbit. He tells me he has always been passionate about trulli, but when he was young, nobody cared about them. "They were mostly abandoned ruins. People saw them as hovels for the poor." "I became a trullaro about 20 years ago. Before that I was a tiler. When I began, there was just one trullaro left in this area. It was a dying trade. Now there are loads of us." I wonder if d'Errico thinks tourists are mad for falling in love with old farmers' sheds? On the contrary, he says he is supremely grateful. "They gave us work and a bit of well-being - they brought our abandoned land back to life. "Even if it has slowed down with the recession and heavy taxes on homeowners, our profession's still growing. I do not make a fortune but I do love my job. It is a beautiful thing that everyone wants a trullo." According to Giuseppe Miccolis, another master trullaro specialising in historic trulli, "the problem is that anyone can set himself up as a trullaro without any formal training or qualification". Miccolis, who comes from a long line of trullari, was born into the profession. "At the age of three, I used to play with the stones. At 14 I started working." He considers his trade an art and a passion. But it is tinged with disappointment and frustration. "It is not just the unskilled self-styled trullari, it is the people who build illegally without respecting our landscape." Nevertheless, Giuseppe is determined to preserve his beloved traditional craft. He has begun taking school children on walks, visiting historic trulli and explaining and demonstrating how they are built. "I am hoping to inspire local kids to develop the passion my family passed on to me. I am going to organise walks for tourists too," he says. "Why don't you come back for one?" My eyes light up.

      <body>Balkh province in northern Afghanistan is home to some of the most significant historical sites in the world - its ancient city was even known as the mother of all cities. More than a decade after her first visit, Lynne O'Donnell returns with a group of archaeologists, trying to uncover more of its treasures. Across the far northern Afghan plain, a hot wind blows the dun-coloured dust into blinding clouds, and the women's burkas into blue billows. It is 40C in the shade, and even the small black goats being herded through the sand dunes look sapped by the heat. These are the lowlands of Balkh, where ancient trade routes attracted nomads, warriors, settlers, adventurers and evangelists, who left behind secrets that archaeologists are just beginning to unlock. This area places Afghanistan at the heart of political, economic, social and religious power across Asia, as far back as 4,000 years ago. The last time I drove across the Bactrian plain was in 2001. I had sailed down the Amu Darya river on a barge from Uzbekistan as British and American forces were pounding the Taliban after the 9/11 attacks in the US. I have returned 12 years later with Afghan and French archaeologists to tour some of the oldest, most magnificent and historically significant sites in the world - sites that are shedding light not only on Afghanistan's past, but on the development of human civilisation, from India to China and beyond. The Bactrian plain is the treasure house of Afghanistan's secret history. Across this desert, Alexander the Great marched his army, killed the king of Balkh and married his beautiful daughter, Roxanne. Some 1,500 years later, Genghis Khan swept through and destroyed teeming cities that were melting pots of diversity. The philosopher Zoroaster, founder of the first monotheistic religion 3,500 years ago, lived and possibly died here. Rumi, the 13th Century poet who wrote in Persian, was born in Balkh - and is also, some Afghans like to think, buried here. Camel trains, loaded with freshly harvested cotton, lope across the parched landscape, against a backdrop of mud walls built to stop the encroachment of the desert on the fertile Balkh oasis. The French archaeologists are here to take a sample of the walls which surrounded a huge hexagonal fort, its shape only visible on satellite photos, strategically placed for both defence and water. They dig deep in to the foundations to fill a metal pipe with dirt, so scientists in Paris can gauge the last time the quartz in the clay saw light. For now, they are guessing around 2,500 years. Nearby in Dawlatabad is the tiny hospitable village of Zadian. We can only go with an armed police escort as the Taleban are active. Little girls in colourful scarves run squealing from the communal water pump as I raise my camera. Men in baggy trousers and turbans emerge to greet us from a shady walled garden. I look up, and my jaw drops. Against the flawless blue sky, a sun-baked clay minaret towers over us. It was built in the 12th Century, still nameless, missed by Ghengis Khan and his marauding Mongols - and by most visitors to this corner of the world ever since. In the oasis of Cheshma-e-Shifa, a huge white rock shaped like an anvil is the sole evidence of a city where Zoroastrian priests performed rituals for the thousands of people who lived here, 600 years before Christ. On the altar's flattened top is a well for oil which burned a perpetual flame that would have been visible across the valley. The French like to wonder if it was here that Alexander married Roxanne. French archaeologists have worked in Balkh for almost 100 years, interrupted by wars and invasions and, in the late 1990s, by the Taliban, who believed history only began with Islam in the 7th Century. In fact, in Afghanistan, Islam displaced Buddhism. The Taliban showed their contempt for history when they destroyed the giant Buddhas of Bamiyan in 2001. Today, archaeologists are confirming Afghanistan's role in spreading prosperity and philosophy across a quarter of the world for thousands of years. For them, the greatness of the past is an example for the future, and in Balkh they see not the violence of the present, but the romance of antiquity. The original Balkh is one of the oldest cities in history. All that remains is a dusty field surrounded by monumental walls that are slowly being revealed by painstaking excavations. In seven years, about 20 metres of the foundations have been unearthed. Visible from the top of the walls are the courtyards of the modern village. Here washing hangs, children chase dogs, donkeys pull carts, and the hot wind blows up endless clouds of dust. In Balkh, whatever comes next when the war ends and foreign troops leave the country next year, will soon be absorbed into Afghanistan's long history.

      <body>Singapore has achieved what only a handful of countries have - joining the so-called First World from the developing world. The city-state transformed itself from a British colonial outpost into the country with the third highest average income in the world within a matter of decades. Not only that, it has become an international financial centre attracting expatriates from across the globe. Foreign workers make up 40% of Singapore's labour market. Exporting consumer electronics has been the driver of growth for Asia since the 1960s, including for Singapore, which has also made the most of one of its few natural advantages, a deep water sea port. For Working Lives, the BBC's Linda Yueh has been meeting people around the island. Wang Han, a young Singaporean design engineer, is the type of highly skilled worker that leads international companies to set up plants in such an expensive country. She works on the innovative digital motor that powers hand dryers and vacuum cleaners for UK company Dyson. The motor is made in Singapore, but the products using it are assembled in Malaysia and sold around the world. That international outlook and the government's promotion of skilled workers also attracts foreigners to Singapore. Frazer Macdonald Hay came to teach young Singaporeans how to integrate design into engineering. He heads a 10-year programme between the Glasgow School of Art and Singapore's Institute of Technology. Chris Gill was attracted by the government's promotion of the financial sector, and a safe, clean environment to bring up his young family. He heads a global insurance company's Asian headquarters based in Singapore. Property developer Satinder Garcha, who according to one survey is Singapore's 46th richest person, plays polo each afternoon in the middle of the city, giving him a rather enviable work-life balance. But it's not just the rich who have a good standard of living. Office cleaner Liew Siew Giok works all day on her feet but goes home to a meal cooked by her Burmese maid. She lives with her extended family, who pay for the domestic help and her flat. The influx of foreigners has created social tensions and the rapid growth of the financial sector has raised some concerns about the future. However, what is clear is that Singapore has grown by being at the leading edge of know-how, giving not just the rich, but most people, a good quality of life. </body>

The firm says it is learning from nature by building computers fuelled and cooled by a liquid, like our minds. The human brain packs phenomenal computing power into a tiny space and uses only 20 watts of energy - an efficiency IBM is keen to match. Its new "redox flow" system pumps an electrolyte "blood" through a computer, carrying power in and taking heat out. A very basic model was demonstrated this week at the technology giant's Zurich lab by Dr Patrick Ruch and Dr Bruno Michel. Their vision is that by 2060, a one petaflop computer that would fill half a football field today, will fit on your desktop. "We want to fit a supercomputer inside a sugarcube. To do that, we need a paradigm shift in electronics - we need to be motivated by our brain," says Michel. "The human brain is 10,000 times more dense and efficient than any computer today. "That's possible because it uses only one - extremely efficient - network of capillaries and blood vessels to transport heat and energy - all at the same time." IBM's brainiest computer to date is Watson, which famously trounced two champions of the US TV quiz show Jeopardy. The victory was hailed as a landmark for cognitive computing - machine had surpassed man. But the contest was unfair, says Michel. The brains of Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter ran on only 20 watts of energy, whereas Watson needed 85,000 watts. Energy efficiency - not raw computing power - is the guiding principle for the next generation of computer chips, IBM believes. Our current 2D silicon chips, which for half a century have doubled in power through Moore's Law, are approaching a physical limit where they cannot shrink further without overheating. "The computer industry uses $30bn of energy and throws it out of the window. We're creating hot air for $30bn," says Michel. "Ninety-nine per cent of a computer's volume is devoted to cooling and powering. Only 1% is used to process information. And we think we've built a good computer?" "The brain uses 40% of its volume for functional performance - and only 10% for energy and cooling." Michel's vision is for a new "bionic" computing architecture, inspired by one of the laws of nature - allometric scaling - where an animal's metabolic power increases with its body size. An elephant, for example, weighs as much as a million mice. But it consumes 30 times less energy, and can perform a task even a million mice cannot accomplish. The same principle holds true in computing, says Michel, whose bionic vision has three core design features. The first is 3D architecture, with chips stacked high, and memory storage units interwoven with processors. "It's the difference between a low-rise building, where everything is spread out flat, and a high rise building. You shorten the connection distances," says Matthias Kaiserswerth, director of IBM Zurich. But there is a very good reason today's chips are gridiron pancakes - exposure to the air is critical to dissipate the intense heat generated by ever-smaller transistors. Piling chips on top of one another locks this heat inside - a major roadblock to 3D computing. IBM's solution is integrated liquid cooling - where chips are interlayered with tiny water pipes. The art of liquid cooling has been demonstrated by Aquasar and put to work inside the German supercomputer SuperMUC which - perversely - harnesses warm water to cool its circuits. SuperMUC consumes 40% less electricity as a result. But for IBM to truly match the marvels of the brain, there is a third evolutionary step it must achieve - simultaneous liquid fuelling and cooling. Just as blood gives sugar in one hand and takes heat with another, IBM is looking for a fluid that can multitask. Vanadium is the best performer in their current laboratory test system - a type of redox flow unit - similar to a simple battery. First a liquid - the electrolyte - is charged via electrodes, then pumped into the computer, where it discharges energy to the chip. Redox flow is far from a new technology, and neither is it especially complex. But IBM is the first to stake its chips on this "electronic blood" as the food of future computers - and will attempt to optimise it over the coming decades to achieve zettascale computing. "To power a zettascale computer today would take more electricity than is produced in the entire world," says Michel. He is confident that the design hurdles in his bionic model can be surmounted - not least that a whole additional unit is needed to charge the liquid. And while other labs are betting on spintronics, quantum computing, or photonics to take us beyond silicon, the Zurich team believes the real answer lies right behind our eyes. "Just as computers help us understand our brains, if we understand our brains we'll make better computers," says director Matthias Kaiserswerth. He would like to see a future Watson win Jeopardy on a level playing field. Other experts in computing agree that IBM's 3D principles are sound. But as to whether bionic computing will be the breakthrough technology, the jury is out. "The idea of using a fluid to both power and cool strikes me as very novel engineering - killing two birds with one stone," says Prof Alan Woodward, of the University of Surrey's computing department. "But every form of future computing has its champions - whether it be quantum computing, DNA computing or neuromorphic computing. "There is a long way to go from the lab to having one of these sitting under your desk." Prof Steve Furber, leader of the SpiNNaker project agrees that "going into the third dimension" has more to offer than continually shrinking transistors. "The big issue with 3D computing is getting the heat out - and liquid cooling could be very effective if integrated into 3D systems as proposed here," he told the BBC. "But all of the above will not get electronics down to the energy-efficiency of the brain. "That will require many more changes, including a move to analogue computation instead of digital. "It will also involve breakthroughs in new non-Turing models of computation, for example based on an understanding of how the brain processes information." </body>

      <body>A study on a Jersey site that revealed a significant piece of late Neanderthal history has been published. Scientists working on an archaeological dig in St Brelade said teeth found at La Cotte suggest Jersey was one of the last places Neanderthals lived. The team of British archaeologists have unearthed items which show the presence of Stone Age hunters at the headland. They said the finds were helping scientists understand more about the early relatives of modern humans. A large portion of the site contains sediments dating to the last Ice Age, preserving 250,000 years of climate change and archaeological evidence. The site, which has produced more Neanderthal stone tools than the rest of the British Isles put together, contains the only known late Neanderthal remains from North West Europe. Dr Matt Pope of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London, who helped lead the research, said: "In terms of the volume of sediment, archaeological richness and depth of time, there is nothing else like it known in the British Isles. "Given that we thought these deposits had been removed entirely by previous researchers, finding that so much still remains is as exciting as discovering a new site." The team dated sediments at the site using a technique called optically stimulated luminesce, which measures the last time sand grains were exposed to sunlight. Dr Pope said the results showed that part of the sequence of sediments dates between 100,000 and 47,000 years old, indicating that Neanderthal teeth which were discovered at the site in 1910 were younger than previously thought, and "probably belonged to one of the last Neanderthals to live in the region". Professor Clive Gamble, from the Natural Environment Research Council, said: "Archaeologists need dates like an artist needs paint. Without a sound chronology the power of our other techniques for probing the past are severely restricted. "This is a great step forward on what looks like being a fascinating journey." The wider project, supported also by the Arts and Humanities Research Council and the Jersey Government, will continue to investigate the site and material excavated from it over the past 110 years. </body>

      <title>Vets raise fears over rabies threat</title>
      <description>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules.</description>

      <body>Scientists are warning that the rabies threat to the UK has increased following changes to quarantine rules. Veterinary experts and animal welfare groups have told the BBC they are concerned they no longer provide adequate protection against the threat of the disease. "There is enough evidence from people on the front line that the risk has increased as a result of the changes," said veterinary surgeon Prof Sheila Crispin. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) says the risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low. It estimated the new rules mean there would be one case of rabies in a pet in the UK once every 211 years, with the possibility of a person dying from rabies obtained from a pet once in every 21,000 years. Before January 2012, the Pet Travel Scheme required animals to be microchipped, vaccinated against rabies and then blood tested. After a further six months they would be allowed entry to the UK. But changes to the scheme, aimed at bringing the UK into line with the rest of Europe, mean animals from the EU and approved non-EU countries such as the US and Australia no longer need a blood test and now have to wait only 21 days following vaccination. Under the new rules, it means animals coming from France are treated the same as dogs coming from parts of Eastern Europe where rabies is endemic. Prof Sheila Crispin, former president of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said the decision to do away with the need for a blood test had also removed a vital check in the system. "For something as important as rabies you really want to know that the vaccine has worked. To wait 21 days and import the animal could be construed as a risk - add to that that the incubation period for rabies can go beyond 21 days and then potentially you have a problem," she says. During 2011, according to Defra figures, 85,774 dogs entered the UK under the Pet Travel Scheme. In 2012, that rose to 139,216 dogs - an increase of 62%. A risk assessment was carried out by Defra before the changes to the Pet Travel Scheme were introduced last year. Prof Crispin says the risk assessment was compiled on the basis that there would be 100% compliance with the new regulations - but that is not realistic, she says. "The trouble is many people have regarded the relaxation as a wonderful opportunity to be dishonest and there's been a huge increase - something like 400% in the first year - of illegal imports, and they are the ones we know about," she says. It is thought the increase is due to illegal smugglers being prepared to run the risk of getting caught, knowing that although they will be liable to pay kennel costs they will get the dogs back after three weeks in quarantine rather than six months. They mostly smuggle puppies into the country because they are easier to sell than mature dogs. Some of the dogs being smuggled into Britain are coming from Eastern Europe, where rabies is found. Animal charities have told the BBC that the quarantine changes, along with the problem of illegal dogs, have left them concerned about the potential risk facing their employees. "The quarantine regulations we have don't reflect the incubation period of rabies. It's not a case of scaremongering, but I think repeating the risk assessment would be a way of doing that, " said Paula Boyden, veterinary director at the Dogs Trust. The Dogs Trust charity is now considering offering rabies vaccinations to front-line staff as a precautionary measure. "At the moment we are monitoring the situation quite carefully. We're certainly considering it," said Paula Boyden. The Dogs Trust is not alone. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home is also in talks over whether to begin offering rabies vaccinations to some of its workers. "We're giving it serious consideration at the moment. It's a three-week wait after the animal has had the vaccination but the incubation period for rabies is anything from two to 12 weeks or even longer, " said Shaun Opperman, veterinary director at the home. In a statement, Defra said: "The risk of a dog with rabies coming into the UK is very low and the risk of rabies being passed from a pet to a person is lower still. "We continue to monitor the situation and will undertake a further, formal risk assessment if we feel that it is warranted." According to Defra, the last case of rabies in dogs in the UK outside of quarantine was in a dog imported from Pakistan in 1970. 5 live investigates will be broadcast on Sunday, 20 October at 11:00 BST </body>

      <title>Blow to multiple human species idea</title>
      <description>The earliest humans from two million years ago in Eurasia and Africa were all part of the same species, a study finds.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24564375</url>

      <body>The idea that there were several different human species walking the Earth two million years ago has been dealt a blow. Instead, scientists say early human fossils found in Africa and Eurasia may have been part of the same species. Writing in the journal Science, the team says that Homo habilis, Homo rudolfensis and Homo erectus are all part of a single evolving lineage that led to modern humans. But others in the field reject this. A team looked at the most complete hominid skull ever found, which was uncovered in Dmanisi, Georgia. It had a small braincase, large teeth and a long face, characteristics it shares with H. habilis. But many features from the braincase were also "unique" to H. erectus. The 1.8-million-year old skull comes from a site that has given up the biggest collection of well-preserved early-human remains known anywhere in the world. The Dmanisi collection also represents the earliest evidence of primitive humans outside Africa, a group that emerged soon after early Homo diverged from Australopithecus, or "Lucy". "We now have the best evidence for what early Homo really is," said lead author David Lordkipanidze from the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi, Georgia. "One of the most important things is that we have such a remarkable collection; it's very rare that you have that from one site." The fossil remains showed a lot of variation that had previously puzzled researchers, but Prof Lordkipanidze said it was clear that these features were all from one population. "When we looked at this variability and compared it with modern humans, you can see this is a normal range of variation," Prof Lordkipanidze told BBC News. The skull was uncovered eight years ago and since then the team has compared it to other Homo fossils found in Africa from as early as 2.4 million years ago. The comparative analysis of the hominid cranium revealed enough similarities for the team to consider the earliest Homo fossils as the same species as the Dmanisi hominids. A co-author of the study, Christoph Zollikofer from the Anthropological Institute and Museum in Zurich, Switzerland, said that if the braincase and the face of "Skull 5" had been found as separate fossils at different sites in Africa, they might have been attributed to different species. "That's because Skull 5 unites some key features, like the tiny braincase and large face, which had not been observed together in an early Homo fossil until now. "Furthermore, since we see a similar pattern and range of variation in the African fossil record, it is sensible to assume that there was a single Homo species at that time in Africa," Prof Zollikofer added. "And since the Dmanisi hominids are so similar to the African ones, we further assume that they both represent the same species." Other palaeoanthropologists, however, believe that at least three distinct species of humans co-existed in Africa. They include Fred Spoor from University College London. He told BBC News that the methods of analysis that the team used were not sufficient to infer that these fossils were the same species. "They do a very general shape analysis of the cranium which describes the shape of the face and braincase in broad sweeping terms," Prof Spoor Said. "The problem is that those Homo species are not defined using such a broad overview of what their general cranial shape is." He added that the very specific characteristics that had been used to define H. erectus, H. habilis and H. rudolfensis "were not captured by the landmarks that they used". "They did not consider that the thick and protruding brow ridges, the angular back of the braincase; and some details of the base of the cranium are derived features for H. erectus, and not present in H. habilis and H. rudolfensis." Chris Stringer at the Natural History Museum in London said that the team had made an excellent case "that this remarkable new skull, with its huge jawbone", was part of the natural variation of the Dmanisi population. But he said he was doubtful that all of the early Homo fossils could be "lumped into an evolving H. erectus lineage". "Only H. erectus survives and becomes successful but at the origin, nature was experimenting with how to evolve humans in terms of increasing brain size," Prof Stringer told BBC News. "Creatures were starting to use tools and eat meat, and this drove evolution, but I think it also drove diversity. The Dmanisi group is an example of the successful species that came out of that and then carried on to spread around the old world." </body>

      <title>'Missing' badgers: call for answers</title>
      <description>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull.</description>

      <body>Conservationists are calling for an investigation into plummeting badger numbers in the run up to the cull. The apparent 50% decline over a year before the cull started appears to be unprecedented, data from other badger populations suggests. Government officials have blamed the cold winter, disease or lack of food for the dwindling numbers. But a wildlife charity claims illegal killing of badgers may behind the fall in numbers and is calling for answers. Meanwhile, reports on social networks suggest protestors have been interfering with the hair traps used to assess badger numbers. This could potentially lead to errors in population estimates. There have been three official attempts to count badgers in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire in the run up to the cull. The first estimate - in October 2012 - concluded there were 3,644 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 4,289 in west Somerset. This was revised down in February this year to 3,368 in west Gloucestershire and 2,473 in west Somerset. Then, just before the cull began, a new estimate of the badger population was produced of 2,350 badgers in west Gloucestershire and 1,450 badgers in west Somerset. The data suggests the population in both areas has fallen from around 8,000 badgers in October 2012, to around 4,000 badgers a year later, across both zones. Defra have given a number of reasons for the apparent 50% decline, including the impact of last winter's bad weather, disease and lack of food. "These badger populations go up and down," the environment secretary Owen Paterson said last week. "We're dealing with a wild animal, whose numbers will go up and down depending on weather, disease and other conditions." However, wildlife charities are concerned that illegal killing of badgers may be behind the fall in numbers. Last week, it was claimed that farmers in the Somerset cull zone had admitted to gassing badgers. The wildlife charity, Care for the Wild, is among those calling for an inquiry into the "missing" badgers. Policy officer Dominic Dyer said it was a serious issue and he would like to see more answers from the secretary of state. "A climate has been created which allows certain individuals to believe they can carry out illegal killing and will not get prosecuted," he said. "And I think that has got much worse over the past 12 months, and that's shared by many people in the wildlife conservation movement as well. "I don't think we have got an accurate feel now for what the numbers are - and we are continuing to cull, that is a very dangerous combination." Data on wild badger populations in England is sparse. However, two badger populations have been well studied - at Wytham Wood in Oxfordshire and at Woodchester Park in Gloucestershire. If factors such as poor weather and lack of food are behind the fall in badger numbers in the cull zones, similar fluctuations would be expected in neighbouring populations, say scientists. A Defra report summarising 25 years of population studies between 1982 and 2006 shows rises and falls in the badger population at Woodchester Park over this time period, but not on a level comparable with the fall reported over the past year. Defra has not given recent information on the badger population at Woodchester Park. But a source said that while badger populations at Woodchester Park do show fluctuations, the biggest change year-on-year is about 17%. Prof Rosie Woodroffe of the London Zoological Society has studied badgers for many years, including at Wytham Wood. She said the difference between last year's and this year's estimates of badger numbers in the cull zone was "very large by the standards of normal fluctuations in badger numbers". They "did not see fluctuations of the magnitude claimed for the Somerset and Gloucestershire cull zones" at Wytham Wood, Prof Woodroffe told the BBC. "I think it would be extremely unusual for such a decline to occur through natural causes - especially over such large areas. "Two possible explanations for the difference in numbers relate to problems with the estimation methods (which are rather opaque and have been subjected to interference by protestors), and to the possibility of illegal killing. "I don't think there's any way to distinguish between these two with the publicly available information, but I'd think either was more likely than a natural decline," she added. Robbie McDonald of the Environment and Sustainability Institute at the University of Exeter said it is hard to discern in any wildlife survey the degree to which observed change is due to genuine population change or error in estimates. He told BBC News: "In general, any estimate of a wildlife population comprises genuine change in that population and then error in population estimations. So there's both of those two things." Defra said in a statement that population estimates for Woodchester for 2013 are not available, and it would not be possible to carry out a comparison between Woodchester Park and the cull areas because the sizes of the areas are so different. "Fluctuations in numbers of wildlife populations occur for a range of complex reasons that it is difficult to assess," said a spokesperson. "We are not speculating on the causes for the drop in the badger population." A spokesperson for the NFU said: "The NFU has no evidence of the illegal killing of badgers. The NFU does not condone any illegal activity that results in the killing of wildlife. "Anyone with any evidence of the illegal killing of badgers or any other wildlife should report it to the police wildlife crime unit so it can be investigated." </body>

      <title>Monkeys 'take turns in conversation'</title>
      <description>Marmosets engage in what appears to be "polite conversation", taking it in turns to vocalise, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Marmoset monkeys take it in turns to "talk" in a pattern very similar to human conversation, according to scientists. Researchers recorded the sounds of the marmosets as they called to one another from behind a curtain. Each animal would call, then wait for the other to respond before calling again. The results suggest an "alternative evolutionary route" for our own conversational turn-taking. They are reported in the journal Current Biology. It is something we take for granted in our conversations, but taking it in turns to talk and listen is crucial for us to effectively exchange information through what we say. Somewhat mysteriously though, we do not see an obvious origin in our closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees. Chimps are not very vocal and tend to use their repertoire of gestures to communicate, so it is widely accepted that these manual gestures provided the foundations for the co-operation inherent in our own communication. But Dr Asif Ghazanfar from Princeton University set out to look for evidence of a vocal route for this co-operation, by looking at vocal exchanges in marmosets. He explained that he chose marmosets precisely because, unlike chimps, they are very vocal. It is one of two main characteristics the monkeys share with humans, Dr Ghazanfar said. "They're [also] co-operative breeders - so they help one another take care of their offspring. "That's an important characteristic because it leads to greater pro-sociality (meaning the animals, like us, carry out behaviours that are intended to benefit others)." The lead researcher, Daniel Takahashi, recorded marmosets calling to one another from opposite corners of a room. The animals were separated by a curtain, so each could hear but not see the other. The recordings revealed that the marmosets would wait for about five seconds after the other finished calling to respond - seemingly following "unspoken rules of conversational etiquette". Dr Ghazanfar explained that there were two ideas for why the animals followed these rules. "One is, if you're out of sight of your group members and want to establish contact with another, you only know if you've established that contact if their response is contingent on your own," he explained to BBC News. "And the other hypothesis is that these calls they exchange might have information content [that needs to be digested]." Dr Ghazanfar says that our own conversational turn-taking might have evolved via a similar route - although on a parallel branch of the evolutionary tree. This provides an alternative explanation to the somewhat "mysterious step" it is suggested occurred as the patterns in chimp-like gestural exchanges evolved into the patterns of our own vocal communication. The team hopes that continued study of the marmosets will help to reveal more about why our own conversation can sometimes break down. "We are currently exploring how very early life experiences in marmosets - including those in the womb and through to parent-infant vocal interactions - can illuminate what goes awry in human communication disorders," said Dr Ghazanfar. </body>

      <body>Ugandan officials have seized some two tonnes (4,600lb) of ivory - one of the country's biggest such hauls for many years. The Uganda Wildlife Association (UWA) has said the 832 pieces of ivory could be worth up to $6.7m but other estimates put the value lower. Experts say some of the ivory is believed to have come from elephants poached outside Uganda. There is a huge demand for African ivory in Asia for use in ornaments. The ivory was apparently heading for the Kenyan port of Mombasa. Some of the tusks had been broken up and covered with plastic bottles in crates labelled as material to be recycled. The UWA told the BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga that Uganda is increasingly being used as a transit country by poachers who kill elephants in states such as South Sudan or the Democratic Republic of Congo. Uganda is believed to have about 5,000 elephants and this haul would represent the tusks from about 400 animals. Last week, some four tonnes of ivory was found in Mombasa after coming from Uganda. According to the UWA, the rate of elephant poaching is relatively low in Uganda, with an estimated 20 elephants killed for their ivory across the country in 2010. After a sharp fall in the number of elephants in Africa, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) banned the trade in ivory in 1989 But in recent years poaching has increased across sub-Saharan Africa with criminal gangs slaughtering elephants for ivory markets in Asia. </body>

      <body>Despite being home to about 16,000 tree species, just 227 "hyperdominant" species account for half of Amazonia's total trees, a study suggests. An international team of researchers found that the region was, in total, home to an estimated 390 billion trees. Writing in Science, they added that the rarest 11,000 species made up only 0.12% of tree cover. However, they added that the new data could help unlock ecological secrets held by the biodiversity hotspot. The results were based on a survey of 1,170 plots and half-a-million trees across the six-million-square-kilometre area, often described as the lungs of the world. The authors said that the underlying cause of the hyper dominance of the 227 species, which accounted for 1.4% of the estimated number of species in the region, remained unknown. "We knew that, normally, a few species dominate ecosystems, but if you have a system that has 16,000 tree species but just 227 make up half of the trees, that was pretty surprising even for us," said lead author Dr Hans ter Steege from the Naturalis Biodiversity Center in the Netherlands. He told the Science podcast: "We don't really know why these species are so incredibly dominant because they do not have any particular ecological feature that stands out." In the paper, Dr ter Steege and the team of more than 100 scientists wrote that there was no evidence that two key functional traits for trees - seed mass and wood density - played a part in determining what species dominated the landscape. "The 227 hyperdominant species include both shade-tolerant, typically large-seeded climax species with dense wood and shade-intolerant, small seeded pioneer (species) with light wood," they observed. The most dominant species was indentified as Euterpe precatoria, a palm tree native to central and southern America, with a mean estimate population of more than five billion individuals within Amazonia. Conversely, the researchers noted that the rarest 5,800 species had communities with fewer than 1,000 individuals, adding: "which is sufficient to classify those that are endemic as globally threatened". They suggested further analysis would show that the species identified as hyperdominant would be "disproportionately resistant to pathogens, specialist herbivores and other sources of frequency-dependent mortality". Dr ter Steege said the data could also be used by conservationists to find out what species were found in protected areas, such as national parks, and what ones were located in unprotected areas, and were therefore vulnerable to threat such as deforestation. </body>

      <title>Nepal mountain expansion bid stalls</title>
      <description>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has failed, the BBC has learnt.</description>

      <body>Nepal's bid to win international recognition for five 8,000m-plus mountain peaks has been put on hold, the BBC has learnt. India and Pakistan could not decide on the matter, causing the plan to stall at the International Mountaineering and Climbing Federation's annual meeting. The tall peaks are appealing to experienced mountaineers; climbing them can make it easier to secure sponsors. Mountaineering makes up a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings from tourism. Winning international recognition for the new peaks would set an important precedent for Nepal because it plans to open several other new peaks in the future to climbers. Some mountain routes, like those leading to Everest's summit, are also becoming crowded, prompting some to call for lesser known peaks to be opened up to climbers. Nepalese authorities had expected the UIAA to recognise the five new peaks during the apex mountaineering body's annual general meeting in Switzerland last week. Three of the peaks are on the world's third highest mountain, the Kanchenjunga massif, two of which are on Nepal-India border and one within Nepalese territory. The two other new peaks are on the Lhotse massif on Nepal-China border near Mount Everest. The highest of the new peaks, Yarlung Khang - also known as Kanchanjunga West - is 8,505m and is in Nepal. All new peaks are within the mountain massifs that already have Nepal's eight highest peaks above 8,000 meters including Everest and are already recognised internationally. Nepalese officials said they had already secured support from China for the five new peaks. "India and Pakistan are also quite positive but they said they needed more time to get this approved by their mountaineering bodies' general assemblies and therefore it could not happen during this meeting," said Ang Thsering Sherpa, past president of the Nepal Mountaineering Association and an honorary member of the UIAA. The UIAA initiated in 2012 what it calls the ARUGA project with an aim to see if new 8,000m-plus could feasibly achieve international recognition. Under that project, Nepal had tabled five new peaks and Pakistan one. "It wasn't possible to decide on this issue without getting the opinion and advice from the involved countries: China, India, Nepal and Pakistan," UIAA Mountaineering Commission President Pierre Humblet told BBC News. "Consequently I wrote to the UIAA member federations from those countries asking them to get in touch with their local authorities too. "I received a fast and positive answer from the Nepal Mountaineering Association and the national public authorities, the Chinese opinion seems to be also in favour of the Aruga project. "But the Indian Mountaineering Foundation and the Pakistan Alpine Club, still in touch with the national authorities, requested more time." The reasons cited for the two countries' indecision are different though. When approached by the BBC to ask if details that it had delayed a decision were correct and if so why, the president of the Indian Mountaineering Foundation, Colonel HS Chauhan, said: "That is one part [of the story] and I will not make any further comment." Knowledgeable sources said the issue was still debated in India and one of the reasons was because the Indian side of Kanchanjunga holds importance in the religious beliefs of the people of Sikkim in northeast India where that part of the mountain stands. Recognising the two border peaks means mountaineering from the Nepalese side would be allowed on them. Pakistani mountaineering officials said they could not decide on the proposal because they had no authority at present. "We were not in a position to decide on our own because during our last government, the ministry of tourism was devolved (to provinces) and now there isn't any authority at the federal level," said Karrar Haidri, member executive consul with the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the country's apex mountaineering body. "We are working on this with the government of Pakistan and hopefully we should be able to decide by the next general meeting of the UIAA." Having already sought international recognition for its own new 8,000m-plus peak on the Pakistan-China border, Pakistani authorities plan to introduce more such peaks. "There will be at least four new 8,000m peaks we will be putting forth for international recognition so there is no reason for us not to support Nepal's move," said Mr Haidri. Pakistan already has five 8,000m peaks, including the world's second highest mountain K2. The UIAA's Pierre Humblet said his organisation's management committee had decided to give up to three months to the Indian and Pakistani mountaineering federations. "Our management committee will then decide about the opportunity to submit the question to the next general assembly," he explained. Mr Sherpa said that if the proposal on the new peaks on Kanchenjunga still remained undecided then Nepal would seek international recognition for only three peaks - Lhotese Middle and Lhotse Shar - on the Nepal-China border and the Kanchanjunga, in the west of Nepal. He said many climbers these days attempt to climb these so-called "side peaks" by using completely different routes from those of the main peaks. "Climbers are doing new adventures, making new routes and accomplishing new achievements and it is our duty to make mountaineering exciting for the new generation," Mr Sherpa. Purna Chandra Bhattarai, Nepal's tourism ministry joint secretary who heads the mountaineering authority of the government: "We believe there are many such peaks in our Himalayas but we need to have a proper survey first. "We are developing a special project towards that end and it will be initiated soon." Mountaineering marked a significant chunk of Nepal's earnings of $360m from tourism last year although officials and mountaineering experts believe that figure can significantly jump if new peaks are opened. Nepalese officials say they are mindful that the addition of the new mountains should not challenge records set by past climbers who have climbed all 14 of the peaks above 8,000 metres worldwide. "It is important to keep a distinction between the historically recognised 8,000m-plus peaks and the newly recognised ones," said Mr Sherpa. "If someone wants to climb all the 14 highest mountains, they must climb the main peaks of each mountain and not the newly identified side peaks." </body>

      <title>Sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins</title>
      <description>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins of a hard day's thinking, US researchers have demonstrated.</description>

      <body>The brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking, researchers have shown. The US team believe the "waste removal system" is one of the fundamental reasons for sleep. Their study, in the journal Science, showed brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. They also suggest that failing to clear away some toxic proteins may play a role in brain disorders. One big question for sleep researchers is why do animals sleep at all when it leaves them vulnerable to predators? It has been shown to have a big role in the fixing of memories in the brain and learning, but a team at the University of Rochester Medical Centre believe that "housework" may be one of the primary reasons for sleep. "The brain only has limited energy at its disposal and it appears that it must choose between two different functional states - awake and aware or asleep and cleaning up," said researcher Dr Maiken Nedergaard. "You can think of it like having a house party. You can either entertain the guests or clean up the house, but you can't really do both at the same time." Their findings build on last year's discovery of the brain's own network of plumbing pipes - known as the glymphatic system - which carry waste material out of the brain. Scientists, who imaged the brains of mice, showed that the glymphatic system became 10-times more active when the mice were asleep. Cells in the brain, probably the glial cells which keep nerve cells alive, shrink during sleep. This increases the size of the interstitial space, the gaps between brain tissue, allowing more fluid to be pumped in and wash the toxins away. Dr Nedergaard said this was a "vital" function for staying alive, but did not appear to be possible while the mind was awake. She told the BBC: "This is purely speculation, but it looks like the brain is losing a lot of energy when pumping water across the brain and that is probably incompatible with processing information." She added that the true significance of the findings would be known only after human studies, but doing similar experiments in an MRI machine would be relatively easy. Commenting on the research Dr Neil Stanley, an independent sleep expert, said: "This is a very interesting study that shows sleep is essential downtime to do some housekeeping to flush out neurotoxins. "There is good data on memory and learning, the psychological reason for sleep. But this is the actual physical and chemical reason for sleep, something is happening which is important." Dr Raphaelle Winsky-Sommerer, a lecturer in sleep at Surrey University, said: "It's not surprising, our whole physiology is changing during sleep. "The novelty is the role of the interstitial space, but I think it's an added piece of the puzzle not the whole mechanism. "The significance is that, yet again, it shows sleep may contribute to the restoration of brain cell function and may have protective effects." Many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are characterised by the build-up of damaged proteins in the brain. The researchers suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to such diseases, but caution more research is needed. The charity Alzheimer's Research UK said more research would be needed to see whether damage to the brain's waste clearance system could lead to diseases like dementia, but the findings offered a "potential new avenue for investigation". </body>

      <title>Air pollution causes cancer - WHO</title>
      <description>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a major cause of cancer by the World Health Organization.</description>

      <body>Pollutants in the air we breathe have been classed as a leading environmental cause of cancer by the World Health Organization. It said the evidence was clear they cause lung cancer. Sources of pollution include car exhausts, power stations, emissions from agriculture and industry - as well as heating in people's homes. The WHO said the classification should act as a strong message to governments to take action. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the WHO, has now classed air pollution in the same category as tobacco smoke, UV radiation and plutonium. It said air pollution had been know to cause heart and lung diseases, but evidence had now emerged that it was also causing cancer. The IARC said the most recent data suggested 223,000 deaths from lung cancer around the world were caused by air pollution. More than half of the deaths were thought to be in China and other East Asian countries. Rapid industrialisation has led to smoggy skies in cities such as Beijing. However, it is a global problem and concerns about air pollution were raised in Europe again this week. Data suggests there may also be a link with bladder cancer. Dr Kurt Straif, from IARC, said: "The air we breathe has become polluted with a mixture of cancer-causing substances. "We now know that outdoor air pollution is not only a major risk to health in general, but also a leading environmental cause of cancer deaths." Cancer Research UK said it was not a surprise. Dr Julie Sharp, the head of health information at the charity, said: "It's important that people keep the risk from air pollution in perspective. "Although air pollution increases the risk of developing lung cancer by a small amount, other things have a much bigger effect on our risk, particularly smoking." Dr Rachel Thompson, head of research interpretation at the World Cancer Research Fund International, said: "This latest evidence confirms the need for government, industry and multinational bodies to urgently address environmental causes of cancer. "But there's also a lot we can do as individuals to lower our chances of developing the disease such as being more physically active and adopting a healthier diet." </body>

      <title>Badger cull falls short of target</title>
      <description>The number of badgers culled during a six-week scheme in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson tells MPs.</description>

      <body>The number of badgers shot during a six-week cull in Gloucestershire has fallen short of its target, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has told MPs. Defra said 708 badgers had been killed in the county, 942 fewer than the target of 1,650. Nigel Gibbens, chief veterinary officer, advised it should be extended. This could be for eight weeks. Badger campaigners have called the scheme a "massive failure" and said they would continue their protest . Mr Gibbens said extending the cull would achieve the "earliest and greatest possible impact" on bovine TB in Gloucestershire. Defra said Natural England was currently considering the application to extend the licence in Gloucestershire and a decision is "expected shortly". Mr Paterson told the BBC the cull figures were "not bad news" but admitted that those carrying out the killings had "got off to a slower start" in Gloucestershire. "We must remember that these are pilots," he said. "This has not been done before and we are learning, clearly, in each area. This isn't a sudden six-week period. These pilots are intended to go on for four years. "Up to to the end of July, a further 20,000 perfectly healthy cattle have been hauled off to slaughter at horrendous expense to the taxpayer because we've lost control of TB." Mr Paterson said 305,000 cattle had been "lost" over the past 10 years and it was "not acceptable" to allow the disease to go on. The badger cull in Gloucestershire ended this week. A licence was granted last week to extend the badger cull in Somerset until 1 November. Defra said early indications from Gloucestershire are that, as in Somerset, the pilot had been "safe and humane". The government's original target was 2,900 badgers, based on a population estimate of 3,400 animals. The target was then revised to 1,650, from a population of 2,350. Last week Mr Paterson said the government was exploring the possibility of gassing badgers to cull carriers of bovine TB. Stop the Badger Cull spokesman Jay Tiernan said the cull had been a "massive failure". "It's disgraceful," he said. "It clearly isn't safe, effective or humane. "It is time for someone to bite the bullet and admit it's been a failure." Mr Tiernan said protests against the culls would continue. </body>

      <title>Osborne agrees to China nuclear deal</title>
      <description>The Chancellor, George Osborne, announces that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants.</description>

      <body>The Chancellor, George Osborne, has announced that the UK will allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. The announcement also said that Chinese firms might eventually be allowed to take majority stakes in British nuclear plants. Mr Osborne made the announcement on the last day of a trade visit to China. The first China deal could be as early as next week, with the go ahead for a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site. Also on Thursday, a report commissioned for the prime minister warned of a growing risk of power shortages over the next few years. The Royal Academy of Engineering said the closure of older power plants and the slow progress in building news ones was likely to stretch the system "close to its limits". Supply is expected to come under strain in the winter of 2014-15. Most existing coal-fired plants are expected to be closed in 2015 to meet European Union pollution directives, while many gas-fired power plants are not being used at the moment because gas is so expensive. These would take time and money to bring back on stream. The Hinkley C project, in Somerset, will be the first new nuclear power station since 1995. Hinkley C's construction will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EDF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. EDF has been negotiating with three Chinese nuclear giants on the Hinkley C project - CGN, CNNC and SNPTC - all of which have been seen by the chancellor this week. Our business editor, Robert Peston, says he has been told that one or two of these will end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. A DECC spokesperson said talks about a contract were underway: "Negotiations remain ongoing between the government and EDF on the potential terms of an investment contract for Hinkley Point C. No agreement has as yet been reached. "A contract will only be offered if it is value for money, fair and affordable, in line with government policy on no public subsidy for new nuclear and consistent with state-aid rules." Mr Osborne made the announcement while on a visit to the Taishan nuclear plant in southern China on Thursday which is itself a collaboration between EDF and the China General Nuclear Power Group (CGNPG). He said: "Today is another demonstration of the next big step in the relationship between Britain and China, the world's oldest civil nuclear power and the world's fastest growing civil nuclear power." The memorandum of understanding also includes roles for British companies in China's nuclear programme. China has 17 nuclear reactors in operation, which provide about 1% of its electricity production capacity. In the future, Chinese firms might be allowed more than just minority stakes in UK plants. The government said that "over time, stakes in subsequent new power stations could be majority stakes". At the weekend, the Energy Minister, Ed Davey, said he believed that a "massive" wave of investment from China, Japan and Korea would secure UK's power supply into the future. Securing future energy supplies is a major challenge. A portion of energy bills is being diverted to alternative energy investment in wind farms and solar energy. But the government believes that renewable energy sources cannot provide enough power for the country's energy needs. The industry regulator, Ofgem, has also warned of the "unprecedented challenge" to secure power supplies. It said spare electricity power production capacity could fall to 2% by 2015, increasing the risk of blackouts. </body>

      <title>Bee-friendly plants put to the test</title>
      <description>An experimental garden has revealed that the right plants can attract up to 100 times more pollinators, say scientists.</description>

      <body>Researchers have used an experimental garden to put pollinator-friendly plants to the test. The University of Sussex scientists counted the number of insects visiting the plants in their garden. They say their findings show that insect-friendly plants are just as pretty, cheap and easy to grow as less pollinator-friendly varieties. Their results are published in the Journal of Functional Ecology. PhD student Mihail Garbuzov used 32 different varieties of popular garden plants. These included some nectar-rich and highly scented plants he thought would be attractive to insects and some that seemed to be less attractive. While the small-scale study did not produce an exhaustive list of the best plants for pollinating insects, the team says the data has put a number on just how many more pollinators the right plants can attract. Mr Garbuzov told the BBC: "Some of the best plants attracted approximately 100 times as many insects as the worst. "And the plants that are attractive to insects are not more expensive, and they're just as pretty." The researchers wrote in their paper that there was "great scope for making gardens and parks more insect friendly" by selecting the right plants. Tips for insect-friendly gardening are already available from a variety of sources, but the researchers say they are largely based on "opinion and general experience". The aim of this study, said Prof Francis Ratnieks, from the University of Sussex, was to "put that advice on a firmer scientific footing, by gathering information about the actual number of insects visiting the flowers to collect nectar or pollen". The researchers gathered their data simply by visiting each of the patches of flowers every day over two summers and counting the number of insects on the flowers. Their results did lead them to make some horticultural recommendations - they found that borage, lavender, marjoram and open-flower dahlias varieties were very good for insects. The colourfully named bowles mauve everlasting wallflower was also very attractive to pollinators, while the least attractive flowering plant for insects was the very popular geranium. Marjoram, the researchers say, was probably the best "all-rounder", attracting honey bees, bumble bees, other bees, hover flies, and butterflies. Borage was the best for honey bees and lavender and open-flowered dahlias were most attractive to bumblebees. The team put a number of varieties of lavender to the test and found that highly bred hybrids, including some with novel colours - such as white or pink - that have been carefully bred into the plants proved the most attractive to insects. Dr Nigel Raine, from Royal Holloway University of London, commented that with bee populations declining across the world, "we can all give bees a helping hand by planting the right flowers to give them the nectar and pollen they need". "This study highlights that it's important for bee-friendly gardeners to choose what you plant with care," he added. "Gardeners and town planners should think carefully about the mixture of flowers they plant to ensure food is available for a wide range of bees and other important insect pollinators. "It's also important to cater for the needs of the rarer species and provide food at times when there might be fewer wild flowers in bloom." </body>

      <body>Elephants have a mysterious and "tangible energy" according to South African photographer Greg Du Toit. Now after a 10 year quest, his portrayal of this "energy" has been captured in an award-winning photo. Titled "Essence of Elephants", the work has earned him the overall title in this year's Wildlife Photographer of the Year competition. Preparation and passion, he says, were key to achieving the winning shot, taken from just over one metre away. "There was one particular day when a baby elephant raced past right in front of my camera and I was ready. I had to be prepared for that moment," said Mr Du Toit. He took the picture at a waterhole in Botswana's Northern Tuli Game Reserve from a hide (a sunken freight container) that provided a ground-level view. He had been going to the area five or six times a year for 10 years. "I chose elephants because I feel a very special energy and connection when I'm around them," he told BBC News. "But although you feel that energy it's very difficult to translate that into a camera because an elephant is such a big animal and they're not very charismatic, whereas a predator is far more charismatic." Using a very slow shutter speed on a wide angle lens "allowed all that energy to come into my camera" making him able to depict "these gentle giants in an almost ghostly way". To achieve the cool blue hue he attached a polarising filter and set his white balance to a cool temperature. The Wildlife Photographer of the Year (WPY) "means a lot to me for various reasons", said Du Toit, especially because photos were submitted anonymously, putting professionals and amateurs on an equal footing. "In my mind it's one of the last places in the world you can actually look at a wildlife photo and trust that the moment is authentic." Chair of the judging panel Jim Brandenburg said: "Greg's image immediately catapults us to African plains. This image stood out for both its technical excellence and the unique moment it captures - it is truly a once in a lifetime shot." This year's Young Wildlife Photographer of the year is 14-year-old Udayan Rao Pawar from India. His photo was of a fresh water crocodile with hatchlings on its head "kind of resembling a crown", explained Mr Pawar. He crept up on the nestling colony of gharials on the banks of the Chambal River, "When the dawn broke early in the morning I hid myself behind a rock, and when the morning light came I took those images. "I could hear them making little grunting sounds. Very soon a large female surfaced near the shore, checking on her charges. Some of the hatchlings swam to her and climbed onto her head. Perhaps it made them feel safe." Despite conservation efforts, the gharial fresh water crocodile is on the verge of extinction with an estimated 200 mating pairs remaining. "The Chambal River is the gharial's last stronghold but is threatened by illegal sand-mining and fishing", added Udayan. Wildlife photographer and Judge Tui De Roy said the composition and timing of the photograph was perfect. "The mother's gaze seems directed at you, appealing to you to let her live and thrive in peace. This image is beautiful and thought provoking, but at the same time also wonderfully playful, making it a clear winner," he said. WPY is one of the most prestigious competitions in world photography. Organised by London's Natural History Museum and BBC Wildlife Magazine, it is now in its 49th year. Images are submitted anonymously by professional and amateur photographers alike. They are selected for their creativity, artistry and technical complexity and must be submitted as a raw file with no manipulations. The winners beat 43,000 entries submitted from 96 countries.

      <title>Clawed fossil had spider-like brain</title>
      <description>A clawed spider-like creature reveals the most intact nervous system ever observed in an ancient fossil, 520 million years old.</description>

      <body>Scientists have discovered the best-preserved nervous system in an ancient fossil. Dating back 520 million years, the clawed spider-like fossil shows clear evidence of a brain and of nerve cords running through the creature's trunk. The specimen now confirms that the ancestors of spiders and scorpions were related, but branched off more than half-a-billion years ago. A team of international scientists present their work in Nature. The "great appendage" arthropods, are an extinct group of joint-legged creatures with large claw-like appendages - or growths - protruding from their heads. The nervous system tends to be similar between major groups of animals, which helps palaeontologists work out how they are related, explained Greg Edgecombe from the Natural History Museum in London. "The nervous system is one of the more reliable tool-kits we have. We were trying to investigate whether there was evidence for the preservation of neural tissues from very early parts of the animal fossil record," he told BBC News. "What we've been working with is fossils with very fine anatomical preservation from the Cambrian period. These have given us information about brains, the nerve cords and the neural tissue that goes into the eyes." New to science, the fossil was recently discovered in South China and is part of the genus Alalcomenaeus. This group had segmented bodies equipped with about a dozen pairs of appendages which enabled the creatures to swim or crawl. It was placed in a CT scanner and compared with other arthropods in order to understand its evolution. The team then used 3D software to see structures not visible on the surface of the fossil. "People like myself who are mad keen on creepy crawlies want to understand how very strange early arthropods relate to living ones," added Dr Edgecombe. "By having access to the nervous system it allows us to study the evolutionary relationships of very ancient fossils using the same kind of information that we would use for living animals." Co-author, Xiaoya Ma, also from the Natural History Museum, said: "It is very exciting to use new techniques to successfully reveal such a complete central nervous system from a 520-million-year old fossil, and in such detail." She told the BBC's Science in Action programme that the high resolution of the reconstructed image allowed the team to see "the concentrated neural structures in the head region". They could also observe the segments of the brain associated with the claw-like appendages. The fossil belongs to an extinct group of marine arthropods known as megacheirans, Greek for "large claws". To infer the evolutionary relationships between species, the fields of palaeontology and neuroanatomy together. Nicholas Strausfeld was from the anatomy side of the team at the University of Arizona, US. "We now know that the megacheirans had central nervous systems very similar to today's horseshoe crabs and scorpions," said Prof Strausfeld. "This means the ancestors of spiders and their kin lived side by side with the ancestors of crustaceans in the Lower Cambrian." He added that their prominent appendages were clearly used for grasping and holding. "Based on their location, we can now say that the biting mouthparts in spiders and their relatives evolved from these appendages." The team says they expect to find more fossils dating even further back, which will shed new light onto the ancestors of many of today's arthropods. </body>

      <title>Meteorite pulled from Russian lake</title>
      <description>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a 570kg chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year.</description>

      <body>Divers working at a Russian lake have recovered a half-tonne chunk of the space rock that exploded over Chelyabinsk earlier this year. The object plunged into Lake Chebarkul in central Russia on 15 February, leaving a 6m-wide hole in the ice. Scientists say that it is the largest fragment of the meteorite yet found. More than 1,000 people were injured when a 17m, 10,000-tonne space rock burned up over Central Russia, breaking windows and rocking buildings. Live footage showed a team pull out a 1.5-metre-long (five-foot-long) rock from the lake after first wrapping it in a special covering and placing it on a metal sheet while it was still underwater. The rock broke into three parts as it was pulled from the depths. Once ashore, it was placed on top of a scale for weighing. However, the scale broke as it hit the 570kg (1,255lb) mark. Dr Caroline Smith, curator of meteorites at London's Natural History Museum, confirmed that the object was a meteorite from characteristic features known as fusion crust and regmaglypts, which are obvious in images. She told BBC News: "Fusion crust forms as the meteoroid is travelling through the atmosphere as a fireball. "The outer surface gets so hot it melts the rock to form a dark, glassy surface crust which we term a fusion crust. Regmaglypts are the indentations, that look a bit like thumbprints, also seen on the surface of the meteorite." Sergey Zamozdra, an associate professor at Chelyabinsk State University, told the Interfax news agency: "The preliminary examination... shows that this is really a fraction of the Chelyabinsk meteorite. "This chunk is most probably one of the top 10 biggest meteorite fragments ever found." The divers' mission had been hampered by a number of factors. The rock fragment lay at 13m depth, not 6m or 8m as was originally thought. The Vesti 24 rolling news channel reported that divers had already recovered more than 12 pieces from Lake Chebarkul since the incident on 15 February. The station said that only four or five of them had turned out to be real meteorites. </body>

      <title>3D printing 'entering the metal age'</title>

      <body>The European Space Agency has unveiled plans to "take 3D printing into the metal age" by building parts for jets, spacecraft and fusion projects. The Amaze project brings together 28 institutions to develop new metal components which are lighter, stronger and cheaper than conventional parts. Additive manufacturing (or "3D printing") has already revolutionised the design of plastic products. Printing metal parts for rockets and planes would cut waste and save money. The layered method of assembly also allows intricate designs - geometries which are impossible to achieve with conventional metal casting. Parts for cars and satellites can be optimised to be lighter and - simultaneously - incredibly robust. Tungsten alloy components that can withstand temperatures of 3,000C were unveiled at Amaze's launch on Tuesday at London's Science Museum. At such extreme temperatures they can survive inside nuclear fusion reactors and on the nozzles of rockets. "We want to build the best quality metal products ever made. Objects you can't possibly manufacture any other way," said David Jarvis, Esa's head of new materials and energy research. "To build a [fusion reactor], like Iter, you somehow have to take the heat of the Sun and put it in a metal box. "3,000C is as hot as you can imagine for engineering. "If we can get 3D metal printing to work, we are well on the way to commercial nuclear fusion." Additive manufacturing with metal is not new; General Electric, for example, has used the technique to make fuel injectors for one of its aircraft engines. China claims to be using 3D printing to manufacture load-bearing components in aircraft. And in July, Nasa announced that it had successfully tested a 3D-printed rocket engine part. Amaze is a loose acronym for Additive Manufacturing Aiming Towards Zero Waste and Efficient Production of High-Tech Metal Products. The 20m-euro project brings together 28 partners from European industry and academia - including Airbus, Astrium, Norsk Titanium, Cranfield University, EADS, and the Culham Centre for Fusion Energy. Factory sites are being set up in France, Germany, Italy, Norway and the UK to develop the industrial supply chain. Amaze researchers have already begun printing metal jet engine parts and aeroplane wing sections up to 2m in size. These high-strength components are typically built from expensive, exotic metals such as titanium, tantalum and vanadium. Using traditional techniques to fashion metal objects often wastes precious raw material. Whereas additive manufacturing - building parts up layer-on-layer from 3D digital data - has the potential to produce almost "zero waste". "To produce one kilo of metal, you use one kilo of metal - not 20 kilos," says Esa's Franco Ongaro. "We need to clean up our act - the space industry needs to be more green. And this technique will help us." Printing objects as a single piece - without welding or bolting - can make them both stronger and lighter. A weight reduction of even 1kg for a long-range aircraft will save hundreds of thousands of dollars over its lifespan. "Our ultimate aim is to print a satellite in a single piece. One chunk of metal, that doesn't need to be welded or bolted," said Jarvis. "To do that would save 50% of the costs - millions of euros." But Jarvis is candid about the problems and inefficiencies that still need to be overcome - what he calls the "dirty secrets" of 3D printing. "One common problem is porosity - small air bubbles in the product. Rough surface finishing is an issue too," he said. "We need to understand these defects and eliminate them - if we want to achieve industrial quality. "And we need to make the process repeatable - scale it up. "We can't do all this unless we collaborate between industries - space, fusion, aeronautics. "We need all these teams working together and sharing." </body>

      <title>Nobel winner Higgs plans to retire</title>
      <description>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, promises to retire - once he turns 85.</description>

      <body>Prof Peter Higgs, the joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize for Physics, has promised to retire - once he turns 85. In a BBC Scotland interview, he also revealed that he turned down the offer of a knighthood because he did not want "that sort of title". Prof Higgs said he feels uncomfortable being likened to other Nobel winners. The 84-year-old said this was because his work on the particle which carries his name only took a very short time. He said: "I'm getting the prize for something which took me two or three weeks in 1964. It's a very small amount of my life. "If you take Einstein for the example, his achievements were several orders of magnitude greater." Prof Higgs was born in Newcastle, but developed his theory while working at the University of Edinburgh. His landmark research defined what was to become known as the Higgs boson. Discovering the particle became one of the most sought-after goals in science, and the team of scientists from the European nuclear research facility Cern, who were behind the $10bn Large Hadron Collider (LHC), made proving its existence a key priority. In July 2012, physicists at Cern confirmed the discovery of a particle consistent with the Higgs boson. Prof Higgs said he was offered a knighthood in 1999 by Prime Minister Tony Blair but refused the honour. "I thought anything of that sort was premature," he explained, "and anyway, I didn't want that sort of title thank you." "As you know I've recently become a Companion of Honour but that's rather discreet. It's a couple of letters after your name." The physicist retired from full-time teaching 17 years ago but has remained active in sharing his knowledge with other scientists. He now intends to retire "properly" after his 85th birthday. "I'm proposing to retire at the age of 85, next year," he confirmed. "But flying around the world giving lectures is a fairly recent phenomenon because of the build up to this discovery at Cern." </body>

      <title>Apes comfort each other 'like humans'</title>
      <description>Observations of young bonobos reveal that, like children, those more able to manage their own emotions are more likely to comfort others.</description>

      <body>Young bonobos that are more "socially competent" are more likely to cuddle and calm other apes that are in distress, research has revealed. Scientists working at an African sanctuary found that bonobos that recovered quickly from an upsetting experience, such as a fight, were also more likely to comfort others. This mirrors findings from studies in children, and suggests bonobos manage their emotions in a very similar way. The work is published in PNAS journal. The researchers captured footage showing "emotionally competent" young apes rushing to hug other juveniles that were screaming after being attacked. Bonobos are already known as the "empathic apes". Previous studies have documented their responses to others' emotions. Prof Frans de Waal from Yerkes National Primate Research Center at Emory University in Atlanta, said these new results revealed that their ability to console one another was part of this empathy. He added: "It's almost as if one first needs to have one's own emotional house in order before one is ready to visit the emotional house of another. "This is true for children, and apparently also for bonobos." Prof de Waal's colleague and the lead researcher who gathered footage of these ape interactions was Dr Zanna Clay, also from Emory University. She explained that the sanctuary, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, provided a natural setting to study emotional behaviour, because the rescued orphan bonobos there behaved very differently from the apes that had been raised by their mothers. The Olola ya Bonoboo sanctuary is home to many bonobo victims of bushmeat hunting; apes that were taken from their mothers at an early age by hunters. These youngsters are cared for by humans and, after several years of this rehabilitation, they are transferred into a forested enclosure to join a group of bonobos. Watching the bonobos, Dr Clay found that rehabilitated orphans had much more difficulty managing their emotions. After a fight, Dr Clay explained, these orphan apes "would be very upset, screaming for minutes". "Mother-reared juveniles would recover and snap out of it in seconds," she added. The findings, the researchers say, indicate that "the way we develop our social and emotional skills and how we deal with the emotional world around us may be shared with that of our closest ape relatives". Richard Byrne is professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews. He pointed out that the term "consolation" implies that we know about the emotion of the apes and their reasons for intervening, which, he said, "is not part of the observed data". "But they are our closest relatives, so personally I would argue that the best guess of their emotions is that they'd be the same as our own in a similar situation." </body>

      <title>'Diamond rain' on Saturn and Jupiter</title>
      <description>Diamonds as big as jewels fall as "rain" on Saturn and Jupiter, seeded by giant lightning storms, according to new calculations by US scientists.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24477667</url>

      <body>Diamonds big enough to be worn by Hollywood film stars could be raining down on Saturn and Jupiter, US scientists have calculated. New atmospheric data for the gas giants indicates that carbon is abundant in its dazzling crystal form, they say. Lightning storms turn methane into soot (carbon) which as it falls hardens into chunks of graphite and then diamond. These diamond "hail stones" eventually melt into a liquid sea in the planets' hot cores, they told a conference. The biggest diamonds would likely be about a centimetre in diameter - "big enough to put on a ring, although of course they would be uncut," says Dr Kevin Baines, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. He added they would be of a size that the late film actress Elizabeth Taylor would have been "proud to wear". "The bottom line is that 1,000 tonnes of diamonds a year are being created on Saturn. "People ask me - how can you really tell? Because there's no way you can go and observe it. "It all boils down to the chemistry. And we think we're pretty certain." Baines presented his unpublished findings at the annual meeting of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society in Denver, Colorado, alongside his co-author Mona Delitsky, from California Speciality Engineering. Uranus and Neptune have long been thought to harbour gemstones. But Saturn and Jupiter were not thought to have suitable atmospheres. Baines and Delitsky analysed the latest temperature and pressure predictions for the planets' interiors, as well as new data on how carbon behaves in different conditions. They concluded that stable crystals of diamond will "hail down over a huge region" of Saturn in particular. "It all begins in the upper atmosphere, in the thunderstorm alleys, where lightning turns methane into soot," said Baines. "As the soot falls, the pressure on it increases. And after about 1,000 miles it turns to graphite - the sheet-like form of carbon you find in pencils." By a depth of 6,000km, these chunks of falling graphite toughen into diamonds - strong and unreactive. These continue to fall for another 30,000km - "about two-and-a-half Earth-spans" says Baines. "Once you get down to those extreme depths, the pressure and temperature is so hellish, there's no way the diamonds could remain solid. "It's very uncertain what happens to carbon down there." One possibility is that a "sea" of liquid carbon could form. "Diamonds aren't forever on Saturn and Jupiter. But they are on Uranus and Neptune, which are colder at their cores," says Baines. The findings are yet to be peer reviewed, but other planetary experts contacted by BBC News said the possibility of diamond rain "cannot be dismissed". "The idea that there is a depth range within the atmospheres of Jupiter and (even more so) Saturn within which carbon would be stable as diamond does seem sensible," says Prof Raymond Jeanloz, one of the team who first predicted diamonds on Uranus and Neptune. "And given the large sizes of these planets, the amount of carbon (therefore diamond) that may be present is hardly negligible." However Dr Nadine Nettelmann, of the University of California, Santa Cruz, said further work was needed to understand whether carbon can form diamonds in an atmosphere which is rich in hydrogen and helium - such as Saturn's. "Baines and Delitsky considered the data for pure carbon, instead of a carbon-hydrogen-helium mixture," she explained. "We cannot exclude the proposed scenario (diamond rain on Saturn and Jupiter) but we simply have no data on mixtures in the planets. So we do not know if diamond formation occurs at all." Meanwhile, an exoplanet that was believed to consist largely of diamond may not be so precious after all, according to new research. The so-called "diamond planet" 55 Cancri e orbits a star 40 light-years from our Solar System. A study in 2010 suggested it was a rocky world with a surface of graphite surrounding a thick layer of diamond, instead of water and granite like Earth. But new research to be published in the Astrophysical Journal, calls this conclusion in question, making it unlikely any space probe sent to sample the planet's innards would dig up anything sparkling. Carbon, the element diamonds are made of, now appears to be less abundant in relation to oxygen in the planet's host star - and by extension, perhaps the planet. "Based on what we know at this point, 55 Cancri e is more of a 'diamond in the rough'," said author Johanna Teske, of the University of Arizona. </body>

      <title>Push for 'smaller' Antarctic reserve</title>
      <description>The EU and US lead a new call for the creation of a scaled down marine protection zone in the Southern Ocean.</description>

      <body>A bloc of countries has issued a joint call for the creation of marine reserves in Antarctica. The group, which includes the US, EU, France, New Zealand and Australia, saw their initial plans thrown out by opposition from Russia earlier this year. But the new plan suggests significant scaling down of one reserve in the hope of securing agreement. It will be submitted to a meeting in Tasmania next week. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR), made up of 25 members with interests in the Southern Ocean, has been working since 2005 to establish marine protected areas (MPAs) in the region. At a special meeting in July, plans to establish two giant reserves in the Ross Sea and in east Antarctica were tabled by a number of countries. The Ross Sea proposal, supported by the US and New Zealand, would have banned commercial fishing in an area of 1.6m sq km. The other reserve, supported by France, Australia and the EU aimed to protect 1.9m sq km on the Pacific side of Antarctica. But Russia and the Ukraine questioned the legal basis of the plan that would have more than doubled the size of the world's marine reserves at a stroke. Other countries, including Norway, China and Japan queried the science and the size of the proposed reserves and wanted the inclusion of a "sunset clause", which meant the decision could be reviewed in the future. As CCAMLR operates on a consensus basis, the nations in favour of the plans were forced to withdraw. Now ahead of the Commission's annual meeting in Hobart, the proponents of the reserves have issued revised plans and a call for their adoption. Last month New Zealand and the US published details of a new Ross Sea plan. It cut the size of the reserve by 40% and left a question over the permanence of the arrangement. While the proposal for east Antarctica was also revised, it remains essentially the same in terms of the area covered. "The original bigger Ross Sea plan is now off the table," Paulus Tak from the Pew Charitable Trust told BBC News. "It is now for a smaller area than was originally proposed. They are making the concessions to get the opponents onboard. "Whether that will be a useful move for Russia and the Ukraine who put forward legal objections, remains to be seen." In today's statement, the foreign ministers call on all members of the Commission to support the plans, saying that these regions are "widely recognised for their remarkable ecological and scientific importance". They argue that the proposals before the Commission are based on "sound and best available science and will provide a unique laboratory for marine research, and will have profound and lasting benefits for ocean conservation." However environmental campaigners like Paulus Tak are concerned that the proponents of the MPAs will make further concessions during the meeting. "We call upon the states to maintain the ambition level, and as such each downgrading of the proposal is a matter of some concern from our side, but we want to see a successful outcome of these negotiations." Another issue that could hold up the MPA proposal is the US government shutdown, which could prevent the American delegation from attending. If that happens, the discussion on protecting the Antarctic could be held off for another year. Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Few children 'connected to nature'</title>
      <description>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a three-year study from the RSPB suggests.</description>

      <body>Large numbers of children in Britain are missing out on the natural world, a study from the RSPB suggests. The three-year project found that only 21% of children aged 8-12 were "connected to nature". Girls were much more likely than boys to be exposed to the great outdoors, while children in Wales had the lowest score across the UK. The RSPB says that a perception among some adults that nature is dangerous or dirty could be holding children back. There has been an increasing amount of research in recent years underlining the lack of contact and experience with nature among modern children. Some have argued that this is having a negative impact on their health, education and behaviour. In 2012, the National Trust published a report on the phenomenon of "nature deficit disorder", though it is not recognised as a medical condition. The RSPB says its new study is the first to quantify the scale of British children's exposure, or lack of it, to the natural world. They came up with a definition of what "connected to nature" actually means and then developed a questionnaire with 16 statements designed to assess the level of connection among children. Some 1,200 children from across the UK were asked to agree or disagree with these statements. Only 21% of children in the UK had a level of connection with wildlife and the natural world that the RSPB believes should be realistic and achievable for all youngsters. This "realistic and achievable" value is based on the average scores of children visiting RSPB sites or who are junior members of the organisation. One interesting finding was the gender difference. While 27% of girls were at or above the "realistic and achievable" target, only 16% of boys were at the same level. "We need to understand these differences," Sue Armstrong-Brown, head of conservation at the charity, told BBC News. "Whether boys and girls are scoring differently on different questions, are girls more empathetic to nature than boys for instance? We need to analyse the data to find that out." The report also highlighted significant regional differences. Only 13% of children in Wales achieved the basic level of exposure, compared with almost twice this number in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The average score for London was higher than the rest of England. Overall urban children had a slightly higher connection than those living in rural areas. According to Sue Armstrong-Brown, the attitudes of adults may be having a significant effect on children. "There is definitely an attitude out there, in some cases, that nature is not perceived as interesting or engaging. In some cases it is perceived as a dirty or unsafe thing, and that's an attitude that won't help a young person climb a tree." The RSPB hopes that its study will be taken up by government as one of the indicators on the state of children's wellbeing. Sue Armstrong-Brown believes that improving the natural connection for children is not only good for the youngsters, it is crucial for the future of nature conservation in this country. "If we can grow a generation of children that have a connection to nature and do feel a sense of oneness with it, we then have the force for the future that can save nature and stop us living in a world where nature is declining," she said.

      <title>Extreme weather 'keeps people poor'</title>
      <description>A new study says that extreme weather scenarios can counter efforts to reduce poverty for hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that extreme weather events will keep people poor in many parts of the world. The authors argue that where disasters like drought are prevalent, they can be the most important cause of poverty. They say that up to 325 million people will be living in countries highly exposed to natural hazards by 2030. If aid is not used to reduce these risks, the progress made in fighting poverty could disappear. The report has been compiled by the Overseas Development Institute. It examines the relationship between disasters and poverty over the next 20 years, using population projections, climate models and estimations of how governments can cope with extreme events. The report suggests that up to a third of a billion people could be living in the 49 countries most exposed to the full range of natural hazards and climate extremes in 2030. In sub-Saharan Africa 118 million people in poverty will face extreme events. The big weather issues that will face most poor people are drought, extreme rainfall and flooding. An analysis of the data from rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh in India suggests that where there is a strong risk of drought, then drought is also the single most important factor in keeping people poor, outstripping ill health or dowry payments. "We've often heard that ill health is the biggest cause for impoverishment," said Dr Tom Mitchell, the ODI's head of climate change. "But in the data, in drought prone areas, the biggest cause is the drought - in areas exposed to these hazards, they are the key causes of impoverishment." Developed countries haven't recognised the role that these extreme weather events have in keeping people poor, he says. The big problem is that, at present, money tends to flow in response to disasters, not to prevent them. Dr Mitchell says the recent Cyclone Phailin in India is a good example. "The very fact that it killed so few people means that the chances of raising big finance for recovery efforts are going to be pretty slim. It has not got the big numbers attached to it," he said. "I think there's a direct link between the ability to raise finance and the number of people killed. It's a perverse incentive." Part of the problem is that donor countries are not prioritising aid at the countries that need it most, in terms of disaster risk reduction. "We've tended to provide much more financial support to a set of middle income countries, who can manage it better like the Philippines, Mexico and Indonesia who made really great strides in protecting their populations," said Dr Mitchell. "What we've not done is focus on the poorest countries, the ones most exposed to issues like drought, for example, sub Saharan Africa, we've almost missed it off." The authors of the report argue that the way that vulnerable countries spend their money needs reforming too. Too often the money is spent on the capital city or on infrastructure and not on the poorest people. The report calls for the post-2015 development goals to include targets on disasters and climate change, to recognise the threat they pose to eradicating poverty by 2030. "If the international community are serious about ending extreme poverty they need to get serious about reducing disaster risk for the poorest people," said Dr Mitchell. "At the moment that's not happening, so the chance of ending extreme poverty is pie in the sky, it is just not going to work." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>Air pollution is continuing to damage European citizens' health and the environment, latest figures show. The European Environment Agency (EEA) listed tiny airborne particles and ozone as posing a "significant threat". However, the authors said nations had significantly cut emissions of a number of pollutants, including sulphur dioxide, lead and carbon monoxide. In a separate study, research identified a link between low birth-weight and exposure to air pollution. EEA executive director Hans Bruyninckx said that EU nations had made considerable progress over recent decades to reduce the visible signs of air pollution, with cities now no longer shrouded in blankets of smog. However, he added: "Air pollution is causing damage to human health and ecosystems. Large parts of the population do not live in a healthy environment, according to current standards. "To get on to a sustainable path, Europe will have to be ambitious and go beyond current legislation." The EEA report showed that data suggested that up to 96% of the EU's urban population was exposed to fine particulate matter concentrations above UN World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Even more, 98%, were subject to ground-level ozone concentrations above WHO recommended levels. As well has urban outdoor air quality, the report also highlighted that the natural environment was also continuing to suffer. It said ecosystem were subject to the pressure of air pollution impairing vegetation growth and harming biodiversity." The EEA also produced country-by-country breakdown of air quality data. Responding to the report's findings, Environment Commissioner Janez Potocnik said: "Air quality is a central concern for many people. "Surveys show that a large majority of citizens understand well the impact of air quality on health and are asking public authorities to take action at EU, national and local levels." He added that he was willing to address those concerns in the Commission's Air Policy Review. Infant concerns A separate study, also published on Tuesday, concluded that a substantial proportion of the cases of low birth-weight (less than 2.5kg at 37 weeks of gestation) "could be prevented in Europe if urban air pollution was reduced". The findings, published in the The Lancet Respiratory Medicine journal, said: "The population attributable risk estimated for a reduction in [particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less] concentration to 10 micrograms per cubic metre during pregnancy corresponded to a decrease of 22% in cases of low birth-weight at term." A team of European researchers carried out what they describe as one of the largest studies of its kind, collating data from more than 74,000 births between 1994 and 2011 across 12 European nations. They explained that babies with low birth-weights were at greater risk of mortality and health problems than infants with higher birth-weights. "Low birth-weight has been associated with wheezing and asthma in childhood, and with decreased lung function in adults," they observed but added that there was inconsistency in the findings. "In addition to active and passive smoking, atmospheric pollution exposure is a highly prevalent and controllable risk factor for low birth-weight." Lead author Dr Marie Pedersen from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology in Barcelona, Spain, observed: "The widespread exposure of pregnant women worldwide to urban ambient air pollution at similar or even higher concentrations than those assessed in our study provides a clear message to policymakers to improve the quality of the air we all share." Current EU legislation has sent the annual mean limit on fine particulate matter at 20 micrograms per cubic metre for particles measuring 2.5 microns (PM2.5) or less. This is twice the concentration outlined in World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, which recommends an annual mean limit for PM2.5 exposure to 10 micrograms per cubic metre. These microscopic particles (the diameter of a human hair ranges between 15 and 180 microns) end up in the atmosphere from a range of sources, including road transport emissions, and have been linked to heart and lung disease, cancer and premature death. Prof Bruyninckx described the Lancet paper's findings as "very concerning", adding that despite progress being made in some areas, more action was needed to tackle air pollution. "It is the explicit goal of the European Commission to narrow that gap, and in the long run, close that gap because we are... concerned about citizens' health," he told BBC News. But he explained: "Before you make binding legislation, you want to be on absolutely solid ground scientifically. "Now, we know that [particulate matter] is having a significant impact so we need to adjust our rules and regulations accordingly." Commenting on the findings published in The Lancet, Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists spokesman Dr Patrick O'Brien said the research was "very helpful in providing further evidence on the potential health impacts of air pollution". But he added: "Exposure to some level of air pollution is unavoidable in day-to-day life and the risk still remains fairly low. "Other factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure or excessive alcohol consumption, may contribute more to the risk of having a low birth weight baby." </body>

      <title>Germany delays CO2 limits for cars</title>
      <description>Germany persuades the EU to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars - and angers environmentalists.</description>

      <body>The German government has persuaded its EU partners to delay introducing new limits on CO2 emissions from cars. Environment ministers agreed to revise a deal, reached in July, that set a limit of 95g per km for the average car. That target for CO2 emissions was to take effect in 2020. But Germany, famous for its high-performance cars, says the 95g limit should not take full effect until 2024. Green activists deplored the new delay as a "shameful sop" to polluters. A leading German Green Party MEP, Rebecca Harms, accused Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel of "riding roughshod" over the EU's democratic process, because the 2020 agreement had already been reached between the European Parliament and the Council - the EU ministerial grouping. "Weakening the agreed 2020 limits, which have long been known, is a shameful sop to German car manufacturers and will slow the development of new technologies to deliver more efficient and less polluting cars," Ms Harms said after the ministers' vote. Chancellor Merkel's conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) are holding talks with the Greens on Tuesday on the possibilities of forming a coalition government. But many analysts believe a "grand" coalition between the CDU and the centre-left Social Democrats (SPD) is more likely to emerge. The UK was among the countries that supported the German environment minister's position on Monday, German ARD news reports. The German minister, Peter Altmaier, said "it's not a fight over principles but how we bind the necessary clarity in climate protection with the required flexibility and competitiveness to protect the car industry in Europe". Correspondents say there has been intense lobbying by luxury carmakers such as BMW and Daimler, maker of Mercedes, over the EU legislation. The emissions limits are part of the EU's drive to switch Europe to a low-carbon economy and slow the impact of climate change. There is also widespread concern about other pollutants from car exhausts. In a new report, the European Environment Agency (EEA) says more than 90% of European city dwellers are exposed to the most harmful particles in air pollution - PM and O3. Often the particles are transported for long distances across borders, it says. Under the German proposal, the 95g target for CO2 would be phased in - it would apply to 80% of cars by 2020, and then to all by 2024. The ministers' backing for Germany means a revised plan will now be negotiated with MEPs and the European Commission, and a deal may not be reached until after the May 2014 European elections. EU Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said she was disappointed and rejected the German proposal, Reuters news agency reported. Critics say the delay will undermine investment in greener alternatives, like electric cars and more fuel-efficient engines. </body>

      <title>Warming makes El Nino 'more intense'</title>
      <description>New research says that the El Nino weather phenomenon will be more intense as a result of rising temperatures.</description>

      <body>Scientists say they are more certain than ever about the impact of global warming on a critical weather pattern. The El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) occurs in the Pacific Ocean but plays an important part in the world's climate system. Researchers have until now been unsure as to how rising temperatures would affect ENSO in the future. But this new study suggests that droughts and floods driven by ENSO will be more intense. The ENSO phenomenon plays a complicated role in the global weather system. The El Nino part of the equation sees a warming of the eastern and tropical Pacific, while its cooler sister, La Nina, makes things chillier in these same regions. Like water in a bathtub, the warmer or cooler waters slosh back and forth across the Pacific Ocean. They are responsible for rainfall patterns across Australia and the equatorial region, but their effects are also felt much further away. During the Northern Hemisphere winter, for example, you can get more intense rainfall over the southern part of the US in a warmer El Nino phase. For years, scientists have been concerned about how this sensitive weather system might be changed by rising temperatures from global warming. Now, in this new paper, published in the journal Nature, researchers give their most "robust" projections yet. Using the latest generation of climate models, they found a consistent projection for the future of ENSO. According to the lead author, Dr Scott Power from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, global warming interferes with the way El Nino temperature patterns affect rainfall. "This interference causes an intensification of El Nino-driven drying in the western Pacific and rainfall increases in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific," he said. According to Dr Wenju Cai, a scientist at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), who was not involved with the study, the paper is "significant". "Up until now, there has been a lack of agreement among computer models as to how ENSO will change in the future," he explained. "This paper is significant in that there is stronger agreement among different climate models in predicting the future impact. "This study finds that both wet and dry anomalies will be greater in future El Nino years. This means that ENSO-induced droughts and floods will be more intense in the future."

      <title>Edinburgh panda 'no longer pregnant'</title>
      <description>Edinburgh Zoo says its female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub.</description>

      <body>Edinburgh Zoo's female giant panda, Tian Tian, is no longer expecting a cub, it has been announced. Experts said her hormone and behavioural signs indicated that she had conceived and carried a foetus until late term, but then lost it. Tian Tian was artificially inseminated in April and had been showing signs of pregnancy for several weeks. However, the zoo said she had now returned to the eating and behavioural patterns of a non-pregnant panda. Chris West, chief executive officer for the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, said: "Such a loss has always been in our minds as a very real possibility, as it occurs in giant pandas as well as many other animals, including humans. "Our dedicated team of keepers, veterinary staff and many others worked tirelessly to ensure Tian Tian received the best care possible, which included remote observation and closing the panda enclosure to visitors to give her quiet and privacy. "We are conducting a detailed review of the scientific data collected, but I am totally confident that we did everything it was possible to do." The panda enclosure will remain closed until the end of the week to give Tian Tian time to get back into her routine and to give her keepers a chance to recuperate. Keepers insist Tian Tian received the best care possible and remain confident she will eventually give birth. Mr West added: "The majority of research centres and zoos with giant pandas around the world have not successfully bred until the third or fourth year. "What we have achieved, considering we have had giant pandas for less than two years, is immense. "New hormone research is beginning to indicate that lost pregnancies are more common in giant pandas than first thought, though at the moment no-one knows why." The zoo is renting Tian Tian and male panda Yang Guang from China for around £600,000 a year, hoping a cub or cubs would bring in more visitors. Some experts believe money spent on captive breeding would be better used to preserve the habitat of wild pandas. </body>

      <title>Meerkats 'pay rent' to top female</title>
      <description>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Some subordinate female meerkats wet-nurse a dominant female's offspring in exchange for not being evicted from the group, a study suggests. Researchers found that females were more likely to do this if they had recently lost pups or had returned to the group following eviction. A group's dominant female aggressively suppresses other females from breeding through infanticide or eviction. The findings have been published in the Animal Behaviour journal. "When dominant females are pregnant, in the last few weeks of the pregnancy they usually throw out the top level of subordinate females," explained co-author Kirsty Macleod, a zoologist at the University of Cambridge. "That can be four or five subordinate females that are really strongly aggressed. "This is because if a female is pregnant herself, she is more likely to kill the pups of another pregnant female in an attempt to try and secure care for her own pups. "In the past, we thought that this behaviour was to try and stop the (dominant female's) pups being killed," Ms Macleod told BBC News that it was much more beneficial for females to belong to a group. "If they are on their own then they have a much more higher likelihood of being predated," she said. "In many cases, these females are evicted and we never see them again, so returning to the group is really crucial to their survival. "What we do see in the wild when they do return to the group is this extreme grovelling behaviour, so we can see that they are quite obviously trying to appease the dominant female. When they start lactating, this seems to fit with that behaviour [pattern]." Damp nipples The idea of subordinate females "paying rent" was based on data gathered from research carried out between 1996 and 2011, during which time scientists observed the behaviour of 40 groups of meerkats. Because most wet-nursing occurred underground in a group's burrows, females were identified as producing milk through the presence of suckle marks and sand being stuck to damp nipples. "Just the sheer volume of data available to me meant that I could look at a lot of different things and fairly definitively make these assumptions, even if it is just short of saying that this is definitely what is happening," Ms Macleod explained. The meerkats in the study are part of a long-term project headed by the University of Cambridge and Professor Tim Clutton-Brock, who is a co-author on the paper. The project, carried out in the Kalahari region of South Africa, also featured in the TV natural history series, Meerkat Manor and a Natural World documentary, to be broadcast on BBC2 (except Scotland) at 2100 UK time. "Wet-nursing by formerly evicted meerkats may be a way of 'paying rent' to be allowed back into the group without receiving further aggression," Ms Macleod observed. She added that researchers had long known about this "allolactation" behaviour among meerkats, with it occurring in almost half of the litters. But, she observed: "In a number of cases, it looks as if they are doing it when they are not pregnant themselves. Physiologically speaking, that is quite a big jump in terms of co-operative behaviour." The University of Cambridge researcher explained that wet-nursing was just one of a suite of co-operative behaviours that subordinate meerkats do. "More common behaviour includes feeding the pups when they are a little older, such as catching a scorpion or other invertebrates and passing it on. "They also babysit as well, so when the pups are very small a subordinate female will stay at the burrow for the entire day, meaning that [the adult is] losing all the benefits of foraging for that day." Ms Macleod said that she planned to carry out further research as part of her PhD research: "What I would like to look at in order to nail this (rent) idea down is whether the females that come back and start lactating are subject to less aggression. "Basically, being a subordinate female meerkat is quite a rough deal because you are in a group and you are caring for another females' young. "Then, if you try to have your own young, you are chased out of the group or your pups get eaten. "So there is this constant and very complex trade-off between the costs of trying to leave the group and have your own offspring against the benefits are being in the group." </body>

      <description>The drugs derived from deadly poisons</description>

      <body>These days we have access to a huge array of medicines to protect us from pain, disease and death. But, as Michael Mosley has been discovering, the source of many of our more remarkable medicines have been deadly poisons. Take a look at this picture. It is the most poisonous substance known to man. A couple of teaspoons would be enough to kill everyone in the UK. A couple of kilos would kill every human on earth. It is so dangerous that it is manufactured in military installations and at around £100 trillion per kilo it is also the most expensive substance ever made. Yet despite being so toxic and so costly it is in huge demand. Many people pay large amounts of money to have it injected into their foreheads. It is botulinum toxin - better known as Botox - a toxin produced by bacteria first discovered in poorly prepared sausages during the 18th Century. It was named after the Latin for sausage - botulus. On the LD50 toxicity scale, which measures how much of a substance you would need to kill half the people it is given to, Botox measures just 0.000001 mg/kg. In other words you need would need around 0.00007mg to kill a 70kg man like me. Or to put it another way, a lethal dose for me would weigh less than one cubic millimetre of air. Botulinum toxin kills its victims by causing respiratory failure. It is a neurotoxin - it enters nerves and destroys vital proteins. This stops communication between nerves and muscles. Only the growth of new nerve endings can restore muscle function, and that can take months. Its main claim to fame is that it will iron out wrinkles in ageing faces and does so by destroying the nerves that cause frowning. The quantities used are tiny - a few billionths of a gram, dissolved in saline. In the name of science I tried Botox a few years ago. It certainly smoothed away the wrinkles but it also gave me a weird expression, until the new nerve endings grew. But botulinum toxin is far more than simply a vanity product. It is extremely useful for treating a number of medical conditions, ranging from eye squints to migraines, excess sweating to leaky bladders. In fact there are currently more than 20 different medical conditions that botulinum toxin is being used to treat. More are being discovered all the time. Botulinum toxin is just one example of extraordinarily dangerous poisons that have useful medical applications. Captopril, a $1bn antihypertensive drug, was developed from studies made on snake venoms. Exenatide, marketed as Byetta, is an effective and extremely lucrative drug used to treat type-2 diabetics. It comes from studies of the saliva of the Gila monster, a large venomous lizard that lives in the south-western US and Mexico But the impact of poisons on modern medicine go deeper than simply providing new forms of treatment. One poison in particular helped shape the entire modern pharmaceutical industry. In Victorian Britain, life insurance was a booming industry. This easy money led to a surge in murders, many of them by poison. One of the most high profile cases was a woman called Mary Ann Cotton who, in 1873, was tried for multiple murders. She had been married four times and three of her husbands, all heavily insured, died. The one who survived seems to have done so because he refused to take out insurance. So she left him. In all, 10 of her children died of what seemed to be gastric-related illnesses. Each must have been a tragic loss, but fortunately for Cotton most were insured. Her mother, her sister-in-law, and her lover all died. And in each case, she benefited. By 1872, the unfortunate woman had lost an astonishing 16 close friends or family members. But there was one left - her seven-year-old stepson, Charles. She tried to give him away to the local workhouse but they wouldn't have him. So young Charles soon died. The manager of the workhouse, however, got suspicious and contacted the police. They soon decided Cotton must have poisoned the boy and thought they knew how she'd done it - with arsenic. Arsenic oxides are minerals and as a poison are almost unrivalled. They are tasteless, dissolve in hot water and take less than a hundredth of an ounce to kill. Yet in the 19th Century, marketed as a rat poison, arsenic oxide was cheap and easily available. Children would blithely collect it from the shops along with the tea, sugar and dried fruits. The trial of Mary Ann Cotton would hinge on whether they could find traces of arsenic in the body of her stepson. Forensic science was still in its infancy but they did have a good test for arsenic. This was because there was an awful lot of arsenic poisoning around. A sample from the boy's stomach and intestines was heated with acid and copper. If arsenic was present, the copper would turn dark grey and, when placed on paper soaked in mercury bromide, produce a tell-tale yellowy-brown stain. When they tested the body of poor little Charles they discovered that he had indeed died of a lethal dose of arsenic. Cotton was convicted of his murder and hanged in Durham Jail. She was never taken to trial for the mysterious deaths of her mother, three husbands, two friends and 10 other children. It was a rash of murders and poisonings like this one that led first to the Arsenic Act and then to the Pharmacy Act 1868. This act ruled that the only people who could sell poisons and dangerous drugs were qualified pharmacists and druggists. So it was from poisonings, accidents and murders that the modern legitimate business of pharmacy finally emerged. And one compound - arsenic trioxide - has also found a legitimate medical use, as an anti-cancer agent.

      <title>China: Opportunity and risk for hi-tech firms</title>
      <description>China a land of opportunity and risk for hi-tech companies</description>

      <body>The UK Chancellor George Osborne said this morning that Britain tends to view China as a "sweatshop on the Pearl River". In reality, he told the Today programme, "it's at the forefront of medicine and hi-tech and computing". An official tweeted a picture of him, headphones on, gazing out at the grey urban landscape of Beijing. To coincide with his visit - and that of science minister David Willetts - a new report calls for China to be seen as a land of scientific opportunity not a black hole of intellectual theft and cybercrime. The study is by Nesta, a think tank founded to promote innovation, and it argues that the massive and growing scale of Chinese science means it is simply "too big to ignore"- spending about $500m on research every day and employing a quarter of the world's RandD workforce. A graphic image of a vast frenzy of research comes from a corporate adviser quoted as describing China as a "boiling cauldron of people just trying stuff". The headline facts are certainly impressive: One key factor identified in the report is the extraordinary size of spending on RandD - about $163bn last year, an amazing 18% increase on the previous year with further rises planned, with science seen as a central element of China's long-term strategy for growth. Measured by the number of patents applied for and secured, China is booming. By 2020, it could be producing more graduates than the US and EU combined. And by the same year, it may be publishing more scientific papers than the US. But of course quantity does not mean quality. The study also notes a recent estimate that only 10% of Chinese engineering graduates meet international standards of employability. So is China really a world leader in science or still a sweatshop? Or a bit of both? The answer is complicated, according to the report. The image of China as a science superpower may be accurate but it is only one of several different ways to view the country: The authors themselves argue that China should be seen as "an absorptive state", assimilating foreign technologies but then adding value and novelty to them. But what about the risks? The report acknowledges a darker side - the fears among hi-tech companies about the theft of their intellectual property. One business leader said "we don't feel ready yet to develop our 'crown jewels' IP in China". But he nevertheless supports long-term engagement there. A related threat is cybercrime - estimated, in a study for the Cabinet Office, to cost the UK £27bn a year. But the authors suggest the dangers may be overplayed, and may be of more concern to politicians than business people. Overall, the report concludes, "the greatest risk for companies is of focusing too much on these downsides, and missing out on the enormous opportunities that China presents", and it calls for far closer collaboration. People who've tried partnerships and have had their ideas or technology stolen may regard that perspective as overly rosy. But a new kind of science gold rush is under way in China - and, as in every rush, there are fortunes to be made, and lost. </body>

      <title>The danger of rumination</title>
      <description>Can too much rumination be dangerous?</description>

      <body>The UK's biggest ever online test into stress, undertaken by the BBC's Lab UK and the University of Liverpool, has revealed that rumination is the biggest predictor of the most common mental health problems in the country. A bit of self-reflection can be a good thing, say psychologists. But just how serious can it get when introspection goes awry and thoughts get stuck on repeat, playing over and over in the mind? Rumination and self-blame have long been accepted by health professionals as part of the problems that can lead to depression and anxiety - the two most common mental health problems in the UK, according to the Mental Health Foundation. But new research has demonstrated just how significant and serious their impact on mental health can be. The findings of a ground-breaking study, published in the journal PLOS ONE today, suggest that brooding too much on negative events is the biggest predictor of depression and anxiety and determines the level of stress people experience. The research even suggests a person's psychological response is a more important factor than what has actually happened to them. A total of 32,827 people from 172 countries took part in the online stress test devised by the BBC's Lab UK and psychologists at the University of Liverpool, making it the biggest study of its kind ever undertaken in the UK. "We found that people who didn't ruminate or blame themselves for their difficulties had much lower levels of depression and anxiety, even if they'd experienced many negative events in their lives," says Peter Kinderman, who led the study and is a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Liverpool. "Dwelling on negative thoughts and self blame have previously been recognised as important when it comes to mental health, but not to the extent this study has shown. "The findings suggest both are crucial psychological pathways to depression and anxiety." The human mind is an extremely complex machine and it's generally accepted there is no single cause for depression and anxiety by professionals in the field. But some factors have more impact than others. The study found traumatic life events, such as abuse or childhood bullying, were the biggest cause of anxiety and depression when dwelled upon. This is followed by family history, income and education. Next comes relationship status and social inclusion. "But these didn't merely 'cause' depression and anxiety," he says. "The most important way in which these things led to depression and anxiety was by leading a person to ruminate and blame themselves for the problem. "This shows how psychological issues are part of the routes to the development of problems, not merely that people become ill and then show changes in their psychology." Rumination was found to be more damaging than self blame. Having thoughts stuck on replay in her head is something Teresa (not her real name), 50, from Essex, struggles with and has done for years. "When I don't feel on top of things in my life I start to find it harder to switch negative thoughts off," she says. "If I'm stressed at work or home it's as if the negative thoughts swamp my mind and I can't rationalise them. I get angry with myself for allowing them to run through my head." Teresa has been married for over 20 years and has two children. But despite having a happy home life, she says there have still been times when the negative thoughts have become overwhelming. "There have been a couple points in my life when I have really struggled to cope. Negative thoughts and things from the past came back to haunt me. "Both times I went to my doctor for help but was offered antidepressants. I didn't want to go down that road. I have tried to develop my own coping mechanisms over the years. I find being outside and with nature helps me a lot. It seems to calm what's in my head." Rumination is sometimes referred to as a "silent" mental health problem because its impact is often underestimated. But it plays a big part in anything from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) to eating disorders. And the impact of mental health problems is huge. They affect one person in every four during their lifetime and are the leading cause of disability globally, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). In 2010 alone they are estimated to have cost $2.5 trillion (£1.5 trillion) globally by the World Economic Forum. In the UK one in four people will experience some kind of mental health problem in any one year, according to the Mental Health Foundation. Anxiety and depression are the most common problems. So what does the new study mean for people who have serious problems with ruminating and those treating them? "Obviously it is just one study, and other people will have other important contributions, but we believe our findings are very significant," says Kinderman. It's important to get across what the findings mean for the average person, says Dr Ellie Pontin, a clinical psychologist and research associate at the University of Liverpool, who was also involved in the study. "It's actually a really positive message and should give people hope," she says. "It can be very hard to be told your problems are because of what you have experienced in the past or your genetics, things you can't change. The way you think and deal with things can be changed." Other professionals agree. They argue that such studies highlight the need to put psychological services at the heart of the health system. "This is a positive message," says Angela Clow, professor of psychophysiology at the University of Westminster. "And helping someone tackle negative thought processes is not something that has to be done exclusively by clinical psychologists. "Other health professionals can be trained to deliver simple psychological help and techniques. It doesn't have to cost a lot of money."

      <title>Why the chancellor wants China to invest in UK nuclear</title>
      <description>Why Chinese power giants are getting stake in UK's nuclear</description>

      <body>Part of what has been holding back the development of new nuclear power plants in the UK is their enormous cost. The government is refusing to finance these hugely pricey projects directly - although it will allow the owners of any new nuclear generators to charge well above the current market price for any power they produce in years and decades to come, so that the billions in development and construction costs can be recouped. The big attraction for the chancellor of allowing Chinese companies to invest in Britain's nuclear industry is that they have deep pockets. On his current trip to China, he has told the biggest Chinese nuclear companies they will in future even be able to own controlling stakes in British power stations, and not just small minority shares. When you think about the history of nuclear power, it may be shocking to some that businesses and investors from Britain - whose scientists and engineers were pioneers in this technology in the early days - will not own the new generation of nuclear power plants, and they may instead belong to China's nuclear power giants (as well as to the French and Japanese). The first of these deals with Chinese interests is expected to come next week, when the formal go ahead is expected for the construction of a new £14bn plant at the Hinkley C site in Somerset. This project will be led by the French state-controlled giant, EdF, which has been looking for a partner or partners to share the costs. I am told that EdF has been negotiating with three nuclear giants, CGN, CNNC and SNPTC. One or two of these is likely to end up owning perhaps 30% of Hinkley C. George Osborne has met the bosses of all three of these companies, to give them comfort that he is keen for them to invest in British nuclear in general, and in Hinkley C in particular. Hinkley C's technology will be French, that of Areva. And the capital, the money, will be French, and - it now turns out - probably Chinese too. </body>

      <description>How much better is standing up than sitting?</description>

      <body>Studies have claimed major health benefits for standing for much of the day as opposed to sitting. The difference is marked, explains Michael Mosley. Guess how many hours a day you spend sitting? Fewer than eight? More than 10? A recent survey found that many of us spend up to 12 hours a day sitting on our bottoms looking at computers or watching television. If you throw in the seven hours we spend sleeping then that adds up to a remarkable 19 hours a day being sedentary. Sitting down as much as this is clearly bad for us and some studies suggest that those who sit all day live around two years less than those who are more active. Most of us are guilty of excess sitting. We sit at work, in the car and at home, moving only to shift from one seat to another. Even if you exercise on a regular basis that may not be enough. There is mounting evidence that exercise will not undo the damage done by prolonged sitting. Our technology has made us the most sedentary humans in history. So why is sitting so damaging? One thing it does is change the way our bodies deal with sugar. When you eat, your body breaks down the food into glucose, which is then transported in the blood to other cells. Glucose is an essential fuel but persistently high levels increase your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin to help get your glucose levels back down to normal, but how efficiently your body does that is affected by how physically active you are We wanted to see what would happen if we took a group of people who normally spend their day sitting in an office and ask them to spend a few hours a day on their feet instead. Standing while you are working may seem rather odd, but it is a practice with a long tradition. Winston Churchill wrote while working at a special standing desk, as did Ernest Hemingway and Benjamin Franklin. So with Dr John Buckley and a team of researchers from the University of Chester we conducted a simple experiment. We asked 10 people who work at an estate agents to stand for at least three hours a day for a week. Our lucky volunteers had mixed feelings about how they would get on. "It'll be different, but looking forward to it, yes…" "I think my feet might hurt - I'll have to wear sensible shoes…" "The small of my back, it's going to hurt…" "I'm worried that I'm not going to be able to stand up for all that time…[Laughs nervously]" We asked all the volunteers to wear an accelerometer - a movement monitor - to record just how much moving about they were doing. They also wore heart rate monitors and had glucose monitors that measured their blood sugar levels constantly, day and night. The evidence that standing up is good for you goes back to at least the 1950s when a study was done comparing bus conductors (who stand) with bus drivers (who don't). This study, published in the Lancet, showed that the bus conductors had around half the risk of developing heart disease of the bus drivers. Since then prolonged sitting has not only been linked to problems with blood glucose control, but also a sharp reduction in the activity of an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase, which breaks down blood fats and makes them available as a fuel to the muscles. This reduction in enzyme activity leads to raised levels of triglycerides and fats in the blood, increasing the risk of heart disease. We had good reason to believe that standing would make a difference to our volunteers, but we were also a little anxious as to how they would get on. This was the first time an experiment like this had been conducted in the UK. Would our volunteers stick to it? They did. One woman with arthritis even found that standing actually improved her symptoms. The Chester researchers took measurements on days when the volunteers stood, and when they sat around. When they looked at the data there were some striking differences. As we had hoped, blood glucose levels fell back to normal levels after a meal far more quickly on the days when the volunteers stood than when they sat. There was also evidence, from the heart rate monitors that they were wearing, that by standing they were burning more calories. "If we look at the heart rates," John Buckley explains, "we can see they are quite a lot higher actually - on average around 10 beats per minute higher and that makes a difference of about 0.7 of a calorie per minute." Now that doesn't sound like much, but it adds up to about 50 calories an hour. If you stand for three hours a day for five days that's around 750 calories burnt. Over the course of a year it would add up to about 30,000 extra calories, or around 8lb of fat. "If you want to put that into activity levels," Dr Buckley says, "then that would be the equivalent of running about 10 marathons a year. Just by standing up three or four hours in your day at work." Dr Buckley thinks that although going out and doing exercise offers many proven benefits, our bodies also need the constant, almost imperceptible increase in muscle activity that standing provides. Simple movement helps us to keep our all-important blood sugar under control. We can't all stand up at work but the researchers believe that even small adjustments, like standing while talking on the phone, going over to talk to a colleague rather than sending an email, or simply taking the stairs, will help. I have, of course, written this article while standing. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The story behind the hidden number 1,729</title>
      <description>Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes?</description>

      <body>The year 1913 marked the beginning of an extraordinary relationship between an impoverished Indian clerk and a Cambridge don. A century later, their remarkable friendship has left its mark in the strangest of places, namely in Futurama, the animated series from The Simpsons creator Matt Groening and physics graduate David X Cohen. GH Hardy (1877-1947) and Srinivasa Ramanujan (1887-1920) were the archetypal odd couple. Hardy, whose parents were both teachers, grew up in a middle-class home in Surrey, England. At the age of two he was writing numbers that reached into the millions, so it was no surprise that he eventually read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he joined an elite secret society known as the Cambridge Apostles. Ramanujan was born in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. At the age of two he survived a bout of smallpox, but his three younger siblings were less fortunate, each one dying in infancy. Although he was enrolled in a local school, Ramanujan's most valuable education was thanks to a library book, A Synopsis of Elementary Results in Pure Mathematics by GS Carr, which contained thousands of theorems. He investigated these theorems one by one, relying on a chalk and slate for calculations, using his roughened elbows as erasers. Aged 21, he married Janakiammal, who was just 10 years old. Unable to afford college fees and needing to support his wife, Ramanujan got a job as a clerk. Nevertheless, he continued his interest in mathematics in his spare time, developing novel ideas and proving fresh theorems. Curious about the value of his research, Ramanujan began to write to mathematicians in England in the hope that someone would mentor him, or at least give him feedback. Academics such as MJM Hill, HF Baker and EW Hobson largely ignored Ramanujan's pleas for help, but Hardy was mesmerised by the two packages he received in 1913, which contained a total of 120 theorems. Hardy's reaction veered between "fraud" and so brilliant that it was "scarcely possible to believe". In the end, he concluded that the theorems "must be true, because, if they were not true, no-one would have the imagination to invent them". The British professor made arrangements for the young Indian, still only 26, to visit Cambridge. Hardy took great pride in being the man who had rescued such raw talent and would later call it "the one romantic incident in my life". The resulting partnership gave rise to discoveries in several areas of mathematics and Ramanujan's genius was recognised in 1918 when he was elected as a fellow of the Royal Society. The young Indian savant would later say that many of his theorems were whispered to him in his sleep by Namagiri, an avatar of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi: "While asleep, I had an unusual experience. There was a red screen formed by flowing blood, as it were. I was observing it. Suddenly a hand began to write on the screen. I became all attention. That hand wrote a number of elliptic integrals. They stuck to my mind. As soon as I woke up, I committed them to writing." Ramanujan's career was brilliant, but ended prematurely when he began to suffer from tuberculosis. He returned to India in 1919 and died the following year, aged 32. However, the life of Ramanujan continues to fascinate modern mathematicians, including Dr Ken Keeler, who swapped his job as a researcher to join the writing team behind the science fiction sitcom Futurama. He is actually one of a number of mathematicians who write for The Simpsons and its sister series Futurama. They have retained their love for the subject and they continue to express their passion for numbers by smuggling mathematical references into both series. For example, in order to pay homage to Ramanujan, Keeler has repeatedly inserted 1,729 into Futurama, because this particular number cropped up in a famous conversation between Hardy and Ramanujan. According to Hardy, he visited Ramanujan in a nursing home in 1918: "I remember once going to see him when he was lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxi cab number 1729 and remarked that the number seemed to me rather a dull one and that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. 'No,' he replied. 'It is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as the sum of two cubes in two different ways.'" Their exchange can be unpacked and expressed as follows: 1,729 = 1³ + 12³ = 9³ + 10³ It is rare that a number can be split into two positive cubes, and even rarer that it can be split into two positive cubes in two different ways, and 1,729 is the smallest number that exhibits this property. It is in recognition of Ramanujan's comment that Bender, Futurama's cantankerous robot, has the unit number 1729. The number also appears in an episode titled "The Farnsworth Parabox". The plot involves Futurama characters hopping between multiple universes, and one of them is labelled "Universe 1729". Moreover, the starship Nimbus has the hull registration number BP-1729. This has certainly helped keep Ramanujan's memory alive, but it is probably not the sort of immortality that Hardy had in mind when he wrote: "Archimedes will be remembered when Aeschylus is forgotten, because languages die and mathematical ideas do not. Immortality may be a silly word, but probably a mathematician has the best chance of whatever it may mean." Keeler is proud of his mathematical references in Futurama, and he is philosophical about the many years he spent as a mathematician before becoming a comedy writer: "Everything that happens to us has some effect on us, and I do suppose that the time I spent in grad school made me a better writer. I certainly don't regret it. "For example, I chose Bender's serial number to be 1,729 and I think that reference alone completely justifies my doctorate. "I don't know if my thesis advisor sees it that way though." Simon Singh answered readers' questions on Twitter using #AskSimonSingh. Q: What is the second highest number after 1729 and do these numbers have a name? A: Mathematicians tend to focus on what is the smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3, 4, 5… ways. So 87539319 is smallest number that is the sum of 2 cubes in 3 ways. In "Bender's Big Score" Fry takes cab #87539319. Q: Can you write about Kaprekar's constant 6174 sometime? I think it's better than 1729! A: Not enough space to explain Kaprekar's constant, but I mention Harshad numbers in my book - Kaprekar invented (?) these too. Q: Why does mathematics scare such a large proportion of the public? A: I have a three-year-old son and can see that counting is not a natural process. Maybe the surprise that anybody ever gets maths? Q: I wouldn't say it is rare for a number to be a sum of two cubes, there are infinitely many such numbers. A: Fair point. Q: What is the next big conjecture to be proven? The Riemann Hypothesis? A: Mathematicians seem to rate The Riemann Hypothesis highly. Not something I would ever write about, as it's too complex for my writing talents. Q: What's the next number after 1729 for positive cubes? A: Not sure, but (as you hint) we can look at (-)ve cubes too. Bender's serial number is 2716057, which is 952³ + (-951)³. Q: I see that #AskSimonSingh is due to take place at 16:30BST. Could you reschedule it for 17:29BST? :) A: This is a very good idea. But it is 17.29 somewhere. Q: I don't have a question. I just want to say I really like you as a human being A: Thanks. I guess that is as opposed to liking me as an alien or an amoeba? Q: Why is the number 1,729 hidden in Futurama episodes? A: Many of the writers were mathematicians, and still love numbers, so this is their way of expressing that love. Q: Without computers, how was Ramanujan able to compute properties like the 1729? A: In a way 1729 spot was not miraculous. Many may know that 12³=1728, or 9³=729. Rest is easy. Except it seems that Ramanujan could do this over and over again. Every number was his personal friend.

      <title>Citizen science is the new black</title>
      <description>Are citizen science projects advancing our knowledge?</description>

      <body>Citizen science - the trend for involving amateurs in research projects - is all the rage nowadays but is it real science or just good PR? "This is a blob, nothing too impressive. Oh dear, another blob, these are elliptical galaxies. Ooh look this is a merger..." The Oxford astronomer Dr Chris Lintott flicks through the first of 70,000 images from UKIDSS, the UK Infrared Deep Sky Survey, that have been posted on the Galaxy Zoo website. "This one's a disc galaxy, so this might be what the Milky Way looks like from far away," he adds. The images, which have never been seen before, are part of the latest citizen science project run on the site. All you have to do is look at the pictures and classify the galaxies according to their shapes and features - does it have arms or a central bulge? Is it elliptical? Does the galaxy have a dust lane across the centre? The results should help astronomers to understand how galaxies form, but Galaxy Zoo is just the latest in a growing number of astronomical citizen science projects. The enthusiastic amateur can explore the surface of Mars or the Moon, study solar storms, and even hunt for planets orbiting distant stars. "It's a really exciting time," says Dr Lintott, "citizen science is booming. "That's because astronomers have painted themselves into a corner. They've got really good at collecting data but not so good at processing it. The human brain is still much better at sorting through these images and telling us what we need to know." But it is not just astronomy, citizen science is flourishing in pretty much every field of science. These days you can crunch data on cancer or monitor the spread of ash dieback while playing a simple computer game. You can map the human brain by colouring in neurones, track whales or watch wildlife in the Serengeti all from the comfort of your sofa. The field of natural history has a proud tradition of amateur involvement, and perhaps it is not so surprising to find citizen science flourishing here. According to the Joint Nature Conservation Committee there may be as many as 100,000 amateur naturalists actively collecting and contributing to citizen science projects in the UK - a volunteer effort worth £20m a year. A significant number of those projects are run by the Angela Marmont Centre for UK Biodiversity at the Natural History Museum. Members of the public are encouraged to drop in with specimens, and to access the museum's extensive collections and talk to research staff. When I arrived to meet Dr John Tweddle a fungi workshop was in full swing. "It's exciting actually. You never know who's going to come through the door and what they're going to come with," says Dr Tweddle. "Anyone of any ability can come here to access the collections. Citizen science is really booming at the moment and the most effective projects are actually driving the research agenda. It's really useful science," he added. Of course there is nothing new under the sun. Although he would not have been familiar with the term, Charles Darwin built his theory of evolution by natural selection on the evidence supplied by hundreds of citizen scientists all over the world. Some 15,000 of the letters he sent or received survive at the Darwin Correspondence Project in the Cambridge University Library. Associate director Alison Pearn says Darwin could never have compiled the astonishing wealth of evidence to support his theory without the enthusiastic support of amateur naturalists. "Darwin corresponded with people from all walks of life, plant and animal breeders, gardeners and naturalists, but also diplomats and explorers. He couldn't have achieved what he did without their support. They were eager to contribute to the broadening of knowledge, so it's exactly the same as people do today in what we call citizen science," says Ms Pearn. The computer has added enormously to the power that the amateur can bring to bear on a problem, but interestingly Dr Lintott argues, it is the human brain's unique ability to spot inconsistencies in the vast sets of data scientists have amassed that makes citizen science so useful. "The best and most powerful information processor we have is still the one sitting between our ears. The human brain has a remarkable capacity for pattern recognition, but also for spotting the unusual, for being distracted by something that doesn't quite fit, and that's what we really need," he adds. </body>

      <title>Red destination: Choosing an ExoMars landing site</title>
      <description>Where should Europe's Mars rover try to land?</description>

      <body>The search for a suitable site to land Europe's ExoMars rover in 2019 is about to begin. A request will go out in the next few weeks to the scientific community, asking for expressions of interest to join a working group on the subject. Once this panel is in place, planetary researchers will then be invited to a meeting, likely to be in the spring of next year. This will formally kick-off the site selection process, which should take a couple of years to complete. The European Space Agency's ExoMars rover - a roughly 350kg vehicle - is currently in the late stages of its design. Its mission will be to scour the surface of the Red Planet for signs of past or present life. It will have a drill to pull samples up from 2m down, and instruments to assess any organic chemistry that might be present. But choosing the right place to go on Mars is critical to the whole endeavour. "I expect before the end of this month to issue the call to the science community, asking them for letters of interest in becoming a member of the site selection working group," Jorge Vago, Esa's ExoMars project scientist, told me. "We hope this will generate some buzz, and we hope to appoint the working group in November. It will consist of 10-12 external scientists, the project scientists and people from industry. "I would expect by the middle of next year we should have zeroed in on about four top candidate sites to start studying in detail." The scientific community will propose and argue the merits of various candidate destinations; new satellite imagery will be commissioned to inform the discussions. "Best science" will not, however, be the only consideration in making the ultimate decision. There are very important engineering constraints as well. No landing system yet devised can put down on a sixpence; the best you can hope for is a zone of confidence. Even for the brilliant "skycrane" used by the American's Curiosity rover, there was an ellipse of uncertainty that measured 20km by 7km at the final estimate. ExoMars' landing system is being constructed by the Russians and will be reminiscent of the Lunokhod Moon landers of the 1970s. The expected error ellipse will be considerably larger - about 100km by 15km. This means that wherever the scientists might like to go, the engineers will need to satisfy themselves that the rover can actually get there with minimal risk. So, for example, Gale Crater, the current location of Curiosity, would appear to be off the list of potential destinations because the Russian system will not have the accuracy to put ExoMars in this deep hole. The preponderance of slopes and boulder fields will be a consideration. And because ExoMars is a solar-powered rover, it will also be tied relatively close to the equator. So where will ExoMars go? Favoured Locations that lost out for Curiosity's attention are sure to crop up again. If I were to nominate an early runner in the race, it would probably be Mawrth Vallis. This is a favourite among many European planetary scientists, and is the location where Esa's Mars Express Orbiter spied abundant deposits of magnesium-rich and iron-rich clay minerals - a clear sign that a lot of water was once in contact with the rocks over an extended period. To find evidence of life, you must follow the water. Prof Dawn Sumner, who was co-chair of the Curiosity landing site working group, told me: "Mawrth Vallis is a site of exposed ancient martian crust - crust that is likely older than any rocks we've found on Earth. "The rocks there show spectral signatures of diverse hydrous minerals in data from Mars Express and Nasa's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. "These spectral signatures, within the oldest crust, make this site attractive, because it provides an opportunity to study the formation and alteration of some of the oldest parts of Mars. "Mawrth Vallis, like most of the ancient martian crust, shows evidence of multiple impacts; it is the high concentration of impact craters that indicates that it is old. "These areas show evidence of multiple fracturing events due to impacts, and the Mawrth Vallis landing ellipse identified as a Curiosity candidate shows many fracture patterns that may be related to various impact-forming events. The fracture patterns vary in the area and may be part of the landing site selection considerations." Wherever ExoMars goes, it will be given an initial mission lasting 218 martian days, or sols. It will get rolling quickly to make the most of the opportunity, and in this past week some of those who'll be involved have been getting a feel for what surface operations will involve. A dummy control room has been set up at the Satellite Applications Catapult in Harwell, Oxfordshire, from where instrument teams have been sending commands to a prototype rover in the Atacama Desert. The boulder fields of this Chilean landscape look just like Mars, and it is cold and dry to boot. Twice a day, the Harwell team has been examining pictures acquired by the prototype, known as "Bridget", and then directing it to various targets to investigate. The commands are sent to the "relay orbiter" (in reality, a support team in the desert), where they are checked and uploaded into the rover. Bridget does its stuff, examining rocks with its "hand lens" and imaging the sub-surface with radar, before returning the data to England to repeat the exploration cycle. "Operations is a very different discipline from design and testing; and you have to get people into a different mind-set," says Lester Waugh from Astrium, the big European space company that is leading the manufacture of the ExoMars rover. "You think very much about risk, because if there is any danger that the rover may be damaged, you have to think very seriously before doing something - because you could lose your mission." </body>

      <title>Can science fiction ever get the science right?</title>
      <description>How accurate is the science in modern science fiction?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24518305</url>

      <body>New film Gravity promises to rekindle the debate over how "hard" - or accurate - science fiction should be. Should film-makers adhere to basic scientific principles, or should audiences just feel the magic instead, asks Peter Ray Allison. The relationship between science and science fiction has always been tempestuous. Gravity focuses on two astronauts stranded in space after the destruction of their space shuttle. Since Gravity's US release (it comes to the UK in November) many critics have praised the film for its scientific accuracy. But noted astrophysicist Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson, director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, had several issues with the accuracy of Gravity's portrayal of space. Through a series of posts on Twitter, Tyson - who later emphasised that he "enjoyed the film very much" - highlighted various errors. He noted the Hubble space telescope (orbiting at 350 miles above sea level), the International Space Station (at 250 miles), and a Chinese space station could never be in line of sight of one another. On top of that, most satellites orbit west to east, yet in the film the satellite debris was seen drifting east to west. Tyson also noted how Sandra Bullock's hair did not float freely as it would in zero-gravity. This is arguably not so much an error in physics, but a reflection of the limitations of cinematic technology to accurately portray actors in zero-gravity. That is, of course, without sending them into space for the duration of the film. There has always been a drive for scientific accuracy within science fiction, especially within the "hard science fiction" literary sub-genre. But sci-fi, especially in film, tends to have a more flamboyant approach, where realism is often dispensed with in favour of visual flair. The Michael Bay film Armageddon is known for its woeful number of inaccuracies, from the space shuttles separating their rocket boosters and fuel tanks in close proximity to each other (risking a collision) and to objects falling on to the asteroid under a gravitational pull seemingly as strong as the Earth's. More than one interested observer tried to work out how big the bomb would have to be to blow up an asteroid in the way demanded in the movie. Answer: Very big indeed. Nasa is reported to have even used Armageddon as part of a test within their training programme, asking candidates to identify all the scientific impossibilities within the film. Despite the presence of physicist Prof Brian Cox as a scientific adviser on Danny Boyle's Sunshine, artistic licence seeped in. There's a communications "dead-zone" around the Sun - not something easily explicable using real world rules. Despite claims to the contrary, Red Planet was riddled with scientific implausibilities, from the compatibility between modern equipment and 30-year old Russian technology (imagine attempting to connect a modern PC with a Sinclair Spectrum), to the Martian "nematodes" which had been eating algae that had been sent from earth for the past 30 years. The nematodes should have been worms but looked closer to beetles. And there was no explanation as to how they had evolved to eat non-Martian algae nor what they had eaten before. The science across the film was so "creative" that Nasa refused to act as scientific adviser on the film. But perhaps the biggest example of scientific licence occurs in a plethora of space-based dramas. "The most commonly lauded example of 'bad science', intentionally placed into science fiction, is that of sound," says Ed Trollope, spacecraft operations engineer at technology firm Telespazio VEGA Deutschland. "Because space is a vacuum, there is no sound, which means all those explosions and engine noises shouldn't be there." There's a simple cinematic reason for having the sound of an explosion when a spacecraft blows up - it feels right to the viewer. But other conventions are more difficult for scientists to accept. "My pet peeve is inertia," says Trollope. "There are many good reasons for keeping your engines on in space, but 'maintaining speed' is not one of them. If you turn your engines off, you don't stop." Some do it slightly better than others. "I'd prefer not to single out a single film/book/series for this particular error, because it's so common - but I will laud the old television show Babylon 5, for doing a wonderful job of representing the mechanics of spaceflight inertia so nicely," explains Trollope. 2001: A Space Odyssey's silent scenes of space craft, with their rotating Stanford torus design, were closer than many later examples to the reality of travelling in space. "A classic case of scientific inaccuracy was the first edition of Ringworld by Larry Niven, a novel which won both the Hugo and Nebula awards in 1971," suggests science fiction author Charles Stross. "The author inadvertently set up a series of scenes which implied that the Earth spun on its axis in the wrong direction." Niven fixed it in the second printing. The Duncan Jones film Moon was lauded for a reasonably accurate portrayal of what lunar mining for Helium-3 could look like in the future. Helium-3 is rare on Earth but less rare on the Moon, and using an automated method with a human overseer might be possible. But the economics behind the mining is not explained. The alien signal in Contact is a prime example of what Seti (Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence) is looking for. This is perhaps not surprising as Contact was written by astronomer Carl Sagan. The use of mathematics in the transmission of the message seems reasonable and the time lag in the sending and receiving of the signal is also accurately represented in the film. Science fiction is not just expected to accurately portray science but also to anticipate future developments. "Science fiction hits some predictive targets," says science fiction author Neal Asher, "but rather in the way that a clip fired from an assault rifle will hit some of the enemy hidden in the jungle, but mostly hits trees and leaves." "One of the past criticisms of science fiction has been that it's all 'zap-guns and rocket ships'," suggests Asher. "Now the science fiction writer can smugly point out the LaWs - the US navy laser system - knocking down drones, and then wax lyrical about the X Prize, Virgin Galactic and Elon Musk's SpaceX." Richard Blott, principal consultant at Space Enterprise Partnerships, recalls an early episode of Star Trek ("Spock's Brain", 1968) where the latest space ship is described as having an "ion drive". "Nowadays most new communications satellites have ion engines and they have powered missions to Vesta and Ceres," says Blott. "In the end," Asher concludes, "science fiction is not there to make accurate predictions about the future, it is there to entertain and stimulate the imagination. There is absolutely no doubt that many of the imaginations it stimulates belong to scientists. To some extent it drives and directs science."

      <body>A new stage musical by the writer of Calendar Girls has won two prizes at the UK Theatre Awards, which reward the best of British regional theatre. This Is My Family by Tim Firth, which opened at the Sheffield Crucible in June, was named best musical. The cast included Sian Phillips, who won best supporting performance. Other winners included actress Cush Jumbo, who won best performance in a play for her role as Nora in A Doll's House at Manchester's Royal Exchange. Janie Dee, who starred in Hello, Dolly! at the Leicester Curve, picked up the award for best performance in a musical. Sheffield Theatres, which runs the city's Crucible and Lyceum venues, scooped a total of four awards, including the two for This Is My Family. The musical tells the story of two teenage children, a stressed mum and dad, a bawdy aunt and a forgetful grandmother, played by Phillips, who end up on a disastrous camping holiday. The songs and script were written by Firth, whose past credits include the Madness musical Our House and the Kinky Boots film script as well as the Calendar Girls movie. The other winning Sheffield productions were a stage version of the hit film The Full Monty, which won best touring production, and Mike Bartlett's drama Bull, which was named best new play. In other categories, the award for best children's show was shared between The Borrowers at Northern Stage in Newcastle and Mister Holgado by Unicorn Theatre in London. Blanche McIntyre was named best director for her take on Chekhov's The Seagull, while the prize for best design went to Jonathan Fensom and Charles Balfour for World War I story The Accrington Pals at the Royal Exchange. Wendy Houstoun was awarded the prize for achievement in dance for her "insightful, funny" solo show 50 Acts, while the achievement in opera award went to Welsh National Opera Lulu and Lohengrin. Actor Simon Callow received The Stage award for outstanding contribution to British theatre at the ceremony at the London Guildhall. Professional productions across the UK were eligible, with the exception of West End shows and National Theatre and Royal Shakespeare Company productions in London. The accolade for most welcoming theatre, which was decided by a public vote, went to Exeter's 60-seat Bike Shed Theatre. The winner was chosen by dividing the number of votes for each theatre by its capacity. </body>

      <title>Depp gives award to Christopher Lee</title>
      <description>Actor Sir Christopher Lee says receiving his British Institute Fellowship from Johnny Depp was a "very emotional moment", as Ida, a depiction of the Holocaust, wins the best film prize at London Film Festival.</description>

      <body>Hammer horror star Sir Christopher Lee said it was a "very emotional moment" when he received his British Institute Fellowship from his friend Johnny Depp. He tearfully accepted the award at the London Film Festival, saying: "I didn't know you were going to be here. I must try and pull myself together." The prize for best film went to to Pawel Pawlikowski's Ida, about German occupation of Poland and the Holocaust. Screenwriter Jonathan Asser won best British newcomer. He took the accolade for his debut feature Starred Up, about the practice of placing violent young offenders prematurely in adult prison. BFI fellow and film critic Philip French said of Ida that the jury was "deeply moved by a courageous film that handles, with subtlety and insight, a painfully controversial historical situation". Sir Christopher, 91, who described receiving his award as "a great joy", is famed for his villainous portrayals of Bond bad guy Scaramanga and evil wizard Saruman in The Lord of the Rings. He has amassed more than 250 screen credits, including The Wicker Man, The Man with the Golden Gun and more recently, several Tim Burton films including Sleepy Hollow, which starred Depp. He also played Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels. Depp, who sneaked into the awards ceremony to surprise his friend, said it was his "great honour" to present the award to "a very great man", saying he had been "fascinated and inspired" by him. "He's been a wonderful individual and over the years I've had the pleasure of working with him and it has been a childhood dream come true," he said. "But as great as it is to work with him, that pleasure doesn't compare with getting to know him and being able to count him as a true friend. "A national treasure and a genuine artist. I love ya!" Sir Christopher responded by saying: "I can't thank you enough," in reference to Depp, who he had been told could not make the occasion as he was elsewhere. He went on : "When I take a look back, and it's a long one, 67 years, at the characters I've played I get a truly strange feeling they were all played by somebody else, and not by me. "And there are a few occasions when it has been the case I wish it had!" He said of Depp: "He means an enormous amount to me. He is one of very few young actors on screen today who's truly a star. "Everything he does has a meaning. He's a joy to work with, an actor's dream and certainly a director's dream. I could go on a long time but I'd probably embarrass him." The festival presented the Sutherland Award, for the most original and imaginative film debut, to Anthony Chen, who directed Ilo Ilo, which explores the life and vulnerabilities of a modern affluent family in Singapore. The Grierson award for the best documentary went to Paul-Julien Robert's My Fathers, My Mother and Me, a portrayal of life in Friedrichshof, the largest commune in Europe, which was founded in the 70s. The film reveals the devastating emotional effects of life there on its residents, and jury president Kate Ogborn said the "disturbing film" raised "larger questions of power, parental responsibility and abuse". The film festival closes later with the world premiere of Saving Mr Banks, a dramatisation of the making of 1964 movie Mary Poppins starring Emma Thompson as author PL Travers and Tom Hanks as Walt Disney. Hanks appeared at Bafta's London headquarters on Saturday to give a Life in Pictures talk, during which he revealed some of the difficulties he faced playing "Uncle Walt" on screen. "Walt Disney died of lung cancer; he smoked three packs a day," the two-time Oscar winner told host Francine Stock. "But can we show him smoking in a major motion picture these days? No way in hell. "It's this thing that has happened in movies - real people can't smoke. We literally had a negotiation over whether I could hold a lit cigarette in a scene." In a wide-ranging discussion covering his 30-year film career, Hanks said his success was partly down to his not having "a bigger-than-life persona". "I'm charming as hell, but I don't strike fear and I don't have a huge amount of mystery," he explained. "You're not worried about me killing you, or stealing your daughter, or being some sort of criminal mastermind. "I view myself as a guy that if I had been a good student, I could be a historian," he continued. "And if I had been good at science, I could be a doctor. "I'm not good at any of those things so I'm an actor. These movies, these roles, they're always something that - if I was a little more accomplished - I could be that guy." Hanks can currently be seen in cinemas in Captain Phillips, which opened the London Film Festival on 9 October. Saving Mr Banks is out in the UK on 29 November. </body>

      <body>Stars including Simon Pegg and Matt Lucas have expressed their sorrow at the death of comic and actor Felix Dexter, who died on Friday of cancer. The St Kitts-born Londoner, 52, had suffered from myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer. Star Trek and Shaun of the Dead star Pegg tweeted: "Very sad to hear news of his passing. Very funny man." Little Britain's Lucas added that the Real McCoy star was: "A brilliant performer and ...a very nice man." Comedian and QI panellist Alan Davis added his voice to the tributes, saying that his memories of Dexter went back a long way. He tweeted: "Sad and shocked to hear about Felix Dexter passing away. So many gigs with him back in the olden days. Always a pleasure. RIP Felix." Fellow comic and presenter Dara O Briain linked on Twitter to a clip of Dexter performing as "the accountant" in 90s flagship black comedy The Real McCoy, adding he was "so sad" to hear the news. Comedian and star of The Infidel Omid Djalili described Dexter as "one of the very few who made me howl", while actor David Schneider tweeted: "Lovely, lovely guy. And I think nothing on TV has ever made me laugh more than his Real McCoy Nigerian character", referencing the Real McCoy clip linked to by O Briain. Actor David Morrissey, who has starred in TV series The Walking Dead and State of Play, said he worked with Dexter a while ago, describing him as a "funny, talented and generous man". Comedian Jenny Eclair added: "Terribly sad news about a very nice man who did a lot of fabulous work." Former Brookside star Louis Emerick said Dexter was a "very funny, talented man, gentleman!" tweeting: "Gone too soon." Dexter moved to the UK when he was aged seven and came to prominence in The Real McCoy and later performed for a season with the Royal Shakespeare Company. More recently, he played three of the main roles in BBC Two's sketch show Bellamy's People and is currently appearing in Citizen Khan. The Fast Show's Paul Whitehouse acted with Dexter in Bellamy's People. Whitehouse told BBC Radio 5 live he was privileged to be close to the comedian and actor. "He was a very modest, a very private man," he said. "It was an honour to be close to him. "He stuck in people's minds, Felix. There's been such an outpouring of warmth and affection for him." </body>

      <body>The funeral of Pakistani singer, Zubeida Khanum, who died aged 78 following a heart attack at her home in Lahore, has taken place in the city. Khanum, who recorded almost 250 songs during her career, was famed for her performances during Lollywood's "golden era" of the 50s and 60s. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif described her as a "national asset". She acted in the film Billoo in 1951 but found fame in 1953 with playback singing, pre-recorded for use in films. She received great recognition from the Pakistani film industry for her playback work in the 1953 film Shehri Babu. During the early years of her career, she also did brief roles in a handful of films including Morni and Patey Khan alongside the late Noor Jehan. President Mamnoon Hussain recalled her services for performing arts in the country and said they were "unforgettable". Born in 1935 in Amritsar, Khanum migrated with her family to Pakistan after the partition. She was the eldest of four children and her talent for singing was spotted at school by her teacher, who put her in touch with Radio Pakistan. Despite her family being against a career in music, Khanum performed her first song in Punjabi. Speaking to the BBC in one of her last interviews, she said: "I always had a passion for singing. I was so happy being in the studio. "They loved my voice". One of her favourite songs was from the hit film Saat Lakh called Aaye Mausam Rangeele. "I loved its music and its lyrics," she added. At the height of her career, Khanum, married renowned cameraman Riyaz Bokhari and left the music industry. She went on to have two daughters and two sons. Khanum spent the last few years of her life using a wheelchair and living with her sons in Lahore. One of her sons is the well-known cameraman Faisal Bokhari. </body>

      <title>McCartney plays surprise London gig</title>
      <description>Sir Paul McCartney delivers an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush.</description>

      <body>Sir Paul McCartney has given an impromptu gig in Covent Garden during the lunchtime rush. "Good afternoon," he told that assembled crowd of more than 2,000 fans. "Welcome to Covent Garden." "We're just going to do some songs from our new album so get your phones out... As if they weren't already," he added. The 71-year-old sang four songs from his latest album, New, from a truck parked on the piazza. It follows a similar stunt in New York last week. The London gig began at 1330 BST, about an hour after Sir Paul announced it on Twitter. "I'm getting ready to pop up in Covent Garden," the former Beatle tweeted. "Oh baby!" "Alright! Busking!" he joked after taking to the stage, watched by his daughter, Stella. "This is a change from the '60s because we would just have been coming in from the clubs right now." The singer opened with his current single, also called New, and closed with the same song approximately 20 minutes later, telling the audience: "Thank you very much. OK now, back to work!" "It was very exciting," Sir Paul told the BBC afterwards. "It felt little bit like I was in a dream - sort of a little bit spacey." The gig was an unexpected bonus for many tourists. "We were actually just looking around Covent Garden and we had this big surprise," said Flavia, a visitor from Paraguay. "I'm so happy, I can't believe!" She wasn't concerned by the abbreviated set, saying: "Even five minutes would be OK. Any time seeing him would be OK". Covent Garden employee Harel, 37, said he was "disappointed, but not surprised," Sir Paul only played five songs. While Craig Williams, who "legged it" to the show from work said, "even for that quick 10, 15 minutes, it's all worth it". "I honestly believe the Beatles' music saved my life," he added. "There were some dark times and he's just got a 'live life to the full' mentality, and I really clicked with that." The gig came exactly a week after Sir Paul was mobbed by fans, following a pop-up show in Times Square. He said the shows had been suggested by Stella. "She said, 'what you should do is just pop up somewhere and do a gig, and everyone will just get their phones out and they'll tweet it," the star told the BBC. "And I said, 'well that's not a bad idea - however, I've now got to go and do it!'" The hit-and-run concerts echo The Beatles' final live performance, a mile down the road from Covent Garden, on the roof of their record label, Apple. That show, in January 1969, brought traffic on Savile Row to a standstill and was eventually shut down by police who ordered the band's touring manager, Mal Evans, to turn off their amplifiers. "It started to filter up from Mal that the police were complaining," Sir Paul later recalled in The Beatles Anthology. "We said, 'We're not stopping'. He said, 'The police are going to arrest you'." The star remembered replying: "Good end to the film. Let them do it. Great! That's an end: Beatles Busted on Rooftop Gig!" McCartney's latest solo album was released on Monday. Early sales data suggests the record, which was produced by Mark Ronson (Amy Winehouse) and Paul Epworth (Adele), amongst others, is likely to chart at number three this weekend. He is also due to appear on BBC One's Graham Norton show on Friday night. </body>

      <body>Chiwetel Ejiofor has defended the harrowing scenes of violence in his new film 12 Years a Slave. The British actor plays a free black man from New York who was kidnapped and sold into slavery in 1841. "As an actor you have to slip down the rabbit hole and see what happens because there was no other way of telling the story," Ejiofor said. He was speaking before the film's European premiere at the BFI London Film Festival. The historical drama, from British director Steve McQueen, is already considered a leading contender for the Oscars. It contains several unflinching scenes in slaves are beaten and one where Ejiofor's character, Solomon Northup, is left hanging by a noose all day long, standing on tiptoes to stay alive. "I knew that [Steve] would go to all the places that you'd have to go to and that's what I wanted to tell the story," Ejiofor told a press conference in London on Friday. "It's a strange handicap if you can't talk about violence in a film about slavery. You are not going to do justice to any of the people involved. "I read into the script that there were obviously going to be these struggles and I wanted to embrace that." McQueen, whose films include Hunger and Shame, said that he had wanted to make a film about slavery and had been drawn to Solomon Northup's 1853 memoir, 12 Years a Slave. "The book is pretty extreme," he said. "My responsibility is this: either I'm making a film about slavery or I'm not. "If you make a film about slavery you have to understand why people were in bondage in this way for 400 years, through mental and physical torture." The film has been receiving rave reviews ever since its first screening at the Telluride Film Festival in Colorado at the end of August. It won the People's Choice award at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, which can be an indicator of Oscar success. The cast includes Michael Fassbender, Benedict Cumberbatch and Brad Pitt. Earlier this week Fassbender was reported to have said he would not campaign for an Oscar nomination, despite being hotly tipped for his role as violent cotton plantation owner Edwin Epps. "It's just a grind. And I'm not a politician. I'm an actor," the actor told GQ magazine. Asked about Fassbender's comments, McQueen said: "He's an amazing artist. He's a force to be reckoned with." "His campaign is on that screen," he added. "He's done his thing - that's it." 12 Years A Slave is out in the UK in January 2014. </body>

      <title>Tennant's Richard II rules at RSC</title>
      <description>Early reviews note David Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair in Richard II in Stratford-upon-Avon.</description>

      <body>David Tennant's latest role sees him transformed into a king with flowing locks in the Royal Shakespeare Company's (RSC) Richard II. Early reviews have noted Tennant's "mesmerising" performance and "Christ-like" hair. Richard II is the former Doctor Who star's first RSC role since his acclaimed Hamlet five years ago. Tennant and the cast won enthusiastic applause on Thursday's opening night in Stratford-upon-Avon. The production transfers to the Barbican in London in December. It reunites Tennant with Hamlet director Gregory Doran, who is now in charge at the RSC. Starting with Richard II, Doran intends to stage each one of Shakespeare's plays once over the next six years up to 2019. Written almost entirely in verse, Richard II is a story of power and plotting in which the king's weakness and vanity threatens to drag his people into a civil war. In the cast alongside Tennant are Michael Pennington as John of Gaunt, Nigel Lindsay as Henry Bolingbroke, Oliver Ford Davies as the Duke of York and Jane Lapotaire as the Duchess of Gloucester. The play opens with a funeral lament sung live by a small choir, after which Tennant's smooth-chinned, long-haired Richard arrives in a flowing white robe, in sharp contrast to those around him in chain-mail or mourning black. In another scene he preens his rock-star locks in a mirror. "His hair takes some getting used to," notes The Telegraph's Dominic Cavendish. "Great gingery-brown extensions trail girlishly downwards. Long, magisterial, quasi-medieval robes add to the effeminate impression. "With his startled eyes and concentrated frown, Tennant is frail, pale and consistently interesting but the nervous energy he excels in is confined to quarters early on." Tennant gives a "mesmerising performance that grows in power as Richard's authority declines," according to Michael Billington in The Guardian. "The packed houses for this production's run in both Stratford and at the Barbican may have much to do with Tennant's star presence. But this is the strongest company the RSC has fielded in years." The Independent's Paul Taylor called it "another palpable hit for the Tennant/Doran collaboration". Recent star-name portrayals of Richard II include Eddie Redmayne at the Donmar Warehouse in 2011 and Ben Whishaw's Bafta-winning TV performance in the BBC's The Hollow Crown last year. Tennant told The Independent recently Richard II was a play he had loved since drama school when he saw a production with Sir Derek Jacobi. "It's quite unknowable," he said. "There are no heroes and villains in it, just people trying their best and not managing to get on with their lives." Tennant's association with the RSC goes back to 1996 when, aged 25, he played Touchstone in As You Like It. His other RSC appearances include Romeo and Juliet, The Comedy of Errors, Love's Labour's Lost and The Rivals. By the time he played the Prince of Denmark in Doran's modern-dress Hamlet in 2008, Tennant was a household name because of his lead role in Doctor Who. Tennant's last Shakespearean stage role was Benedick in Much Ado About Nothing in the West End in 2011, alongside his former Tardis companion Catherine Tate as Beatrice. He will be appearing alongside Matt Smith in the Doctor Who 50th anniversary story, The Day of the Doctor, on BBC One on 23 November. Richard II is at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, until to 16 November and at the Barbican Theatre, London, from 9 December to 25 January. It will be broadcast live on 13 November to cinemas across the UK. </body>

      <title>Philomena 'to fight R rating' in US</title>
      <description>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give Philomena an R rating, according to reports.</description>

      <body>Film producer Harvey Weinstein is to appeal against a decision by US film censors to give his studio's latest film an R rating, according to reports. Philomena received the rating from the Classification and Ratings Administration for two instances of bad language. But the Weinstein Company will now officially appeal against the rating, The Hollywood Reporter said. The British Stephen Frears drama stars Dame Judi Dench and Steve Coogan. The film is based on the 2009 investigative book by BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith about Irish-Catholic woman Philomena Lee's search for her son after being forced to put him up for adoption decades earlier. The Weinstein Company plans to release the film in the US over the Thanksgiving period next month, however it has argued the R rating will affect the number of moviegoers who could potentially watch it. The restricted R rating means people under the age of 17 may only see the film if they are accompanied by a parent or guardian. In the UK, it has been given a 12A rating by the British Board of Film Classification, where children younger than 12 years of age must be accompanied by an adult. Weinstein's studio previously became embroiled in a row with the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) in 2012 over the documentary Bully over the use of bad language in the film. It opened in Los Angeles and New York without a rating, after the Weinstein Company chose to ignore the MPAA's original R rating. The studio eventually agreed to remove the language and an edited version of the film received a PG-13 rating. </body>

      <title>Row over Tony Blair 'selfie' artwork</title>
      <description>Two artists complain after advertising companies refuse to allow their photo montage of Tony Blair in front of a burning Iraq oilfield on billboards.</description>

      <body>Two artists who created a montage of Tony Blair apparently taking his own photo in front of a burning oilfield in Iraq have accused advertising firms of banning the artwork from billboards. Peter Kennard and Cat Phillips created the image, titled Photo Op, in 2005. It was chosen by the Imperial War Museum North in Manchester as the image for a poster campaign to promote a new exhibition about modern art and war. But two of the UK's biggest advertising companies refused to carry the image. Photo Op combines a picture of the grinning former prime minister taking a self-portrait on a mobile phone, originally from the 2005 general election campaign, with a separate image of a blazing oilfield during the Iraq war. It has previously been exhibited at Tate Britain and was recently described by The Guardian as "the definitive work of art about the Iraq war". It is now in the Imperial War Museum North's Catalyst exhibition and the museum had intended to use it on posters and billboards. But the artists, who go by the name kennardphillips, have accused advertising companies JCDecaux and CBS Outdoor of "political censorship" in refusing to carry it. The two firms controlled between 50%-70% of the outdoor advertising market in 2011, according to a government report. CBS Outdoor said the poster was refused after consultation with the Committee of Advertising Practice, which advises firms on whether ads may breach its code of conduct. Neither gave details of which part of the code it breached, but the code includes rules forbidding ads that are misleading and are likely to cause "serious or widespread offence". Kennard and Phillips said CBS Outdoor had told them they could not use images involving explosions on public transport, such as on the sides of buses. JCDecaux declined to comment. "It feels like you're not allowed to show anything that appears dissenting," Phillips said. "You get a lot of violence and sex in adverts and a lot of offensive things, but they're not critical in their offence. They're not creating an argument or a question mark. "It feels like if you have anything that is a real show of dissent, it wouldn't be allowed to go up there and there's very little you can do about it." The Catalyst exhibition opened at the Imperial War Museum (IWM) North in Manchester on Saturday. It is the museum's first major exhibition of war-inspired contemporary art inspired created since 1991. The museum's director Graham Boxer said "a number of outdoor advertising suppliers" refused to run the proposed poster campaign. He added: "IWM North aims to inspire discussion and debate about war and conflict and as such we have remained committed to using the kennardphillipps Photo Op image across other media, including on the website, in media coverage, on social media and of course in the exhibition." A spokesman for the Advertising Standards Authority, which operates the Committee of Advertising Practice, said the ad companies "would have been mindful of the advertising rules that require ads are prepared responsibly and do not contain anything that is likely to be misleading, harmful or offensive". </body>

      <title>Flynt: Don't execute man who shot me</title>
      <description>Porn publisher Larry Flynt says he does not want the man who put him in a wheelchair to face the death penalty.</description>

      <body>Porn publisher Larry Flynt has said he does not want the man who put him in a wheelchair to face the death penalty. Joseph Paul Franklin, who shot Flynt outside a Georgia court in 1978, is set for execution in Missouri in November. "I have every reason to be overjoyed with this decision, but I am not," he wrote in the Hollywood Reporter. "I would love an hour in a room with him... so I could inflict the same damage on him that he inflicted on me. But, I do not want to... see him die." White supremacist Franklin, who is being executed for killing Gerald Gordon outside a synagogue in 1977, has been convicted of a total of eight racially motivated murders across the US between 1977 and 1980. He confessed to, or was implicated in, 13 additional racial murders. No deterrent Franklin said he targeted Flynt after the publisher featured a black man and white woman in a photoshoot in Hustler, the magazine that formed the cornerstone of his adult entertainment business. "He hated blacks, he hated Jews, he hated all minorities," Flynt wrote. The entertainment mogul, who suffered permanent spinal cord damage, was left paralysed from the waist down after the shooting. The events were dramatised in the 1996 film The People vs Larry Flynt, starring Woody Harrelson and Courtney Love. "As far as the severity of punishment is concerned, to me, a life spent in a 3-by-6-foot cell is far harsher than the quick release of a lethal injection," wrote Flynt, 70, in a guest column this week. The publisher, who has never met Franklin face-to-face, says he does not believe the death penalty is a deterrent. "I have had many years in this wheelchair to think about this very topic," he wrote. "As I see it, the sole motivating factor behind the death penalty is vengeance, not justice, and I firmly believe that a government that forbids killing among its citizens should not be in the business of killing people itself." In a statement in August, Missouri attorney general Chris Koster said by setting an execution date of 20 November, the court had taken "an important step to see that justice is finally done for the victims and their families". </body>

      <title>Veep star 'would relish' drama roles</title>
      <description>US actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US sitcom Seinfeld and political satire Veep, says she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles.</description>

      <body>Actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus, star of US satire Veep, has said she "would relish" taking on more dramatic roles. "I would love to spread my wings in that direction, why not?" the multiple Emmy winner told the BBC ahead of the release of her new film Enough Said. The comedy, which had its UK premiere at this year's London Film Festival, tells of a divorcee who finds love just as her daughter is leaving for college. Louis-Dreyfus won her fourth Emmy last month for her role in Veep. Created by Armando Iannucci of The Thick of It fame, the HBO show sees her play an ineffectual US vice president whose attempts to expand her role are continually thwarted. Though ostensibly a romantic comedy, Enough Said - the fifth film by writer-director Nicole Holofcener - has "a couple of very dramatic moments" according to its 52-year-old star. "They were a great joy to do even if they were painful," the actress explained. "I hope my fans will be happily surprised." The film, which had its world premiere at the Toronto Film Festival in September and is released in the UK on Friday, sees Louis-Dreyfus appear alongside James Gandolfini. The late star of The Sopranos plays Albert, a well-meaning man unaware his massage therapist girlfriend - the character Louis-Dreyfus plays - has taken on his vindictive ex-wife as a client. "I've never done anything as deceitful in my life but I understand why she does it," said the actress, who described her co-star as a "gentle giant" and a "dear, dear man". "This is a woman on the precipice who's been emotionally hijacked by herself. The dread and fear of her daughter's impending departure fuels this horrible thing she does." The scene in which her character's deception is exposed was both "tough" and "excruciating" to film, said the New Yorker, who is currently shooting the third season of Veep - a slang term for vice president. "But it was exciting to do something so dramatic about large human emotions." </body>

      <body>A life-size bronze statue of comedy character Frank Sidebottom has been unveiled in his hometown of Timperley in Greater Manchester. The character with a huge papier mache head was the alter-ego of musician and comedian Chris Sievey, who died in 2010. Fans raised £60,000 for the tribute which was made in a Czech foundry. Hundreds of people attended an unveiling ceremony earlier, many in fancy dress for the occasion. Neil Taylor, who helped raise the donations for the statue, said its installation would mean that "Frank will gaze on the Timperley sunset forever". He said: "You either got the humour or you didn't get the humour. "Frank Sidebottom created a whole world, he was just magical. He just made a very modest living entertaining people and that's what he's enjoying doing." Sievey set his character's life in the village, where he lived himself, and, as Frank, hosted tours of the area for fans. He often referenced Timperley in his TV and music work, notably on his 1987 release, The Timperley EP, which featured a version of The Kinks' 1967 song Waterloo Sunset with altered lyrics that referred extensively to the village. He also covered Sex Pistols' Anarchy in the UK, changing its title to Anarchy in Timperley. Although best known for Frank Sidebottom, Sievey also had success in the late 1970s with his punk band The Freshies, who had a hit with I'm In Love With The Girl On The Manchester Virgin Megastore Checkout Desk. His TV fame peaked in the early 1990s with his own series Frank Sidebottom's Fantastic Shed Show. Next year Michael Fassbender will play Frank Sidebottom in Frank, a movie inspired by the character. </body>

      <body>Canadian pianist Anton Kuerti has been taken to hospital after falling ill during a recital in Florida. According to eyewitnesses, Kuerti became disorientated and started repeatedly playing the same passage. "One of the audience members who's also a pianist actually went up to the stage to put his arm around him," said concert organiser Alan Penchansky. "He tried to find out what was wrong, and [Kuerti] started again. He simply was trapped," he told Canadian press. The fellow-musician, Santiago Rodriguez, a professor of keyboard performance at the Frost School of Music, eventually coaxed Kuerti off stage, and an intermission was called. During the intermission, Kuerti was seen by paramedics and taken to hospital by ambulance. He did not return. The Austrian-born pianist has been performing live almost all of his life - having first taken to the stage with the Boston Pops Orchestra at the age of 11. As a soloist, he has specialised in Beethoven, frequently playing the composer's entire cycle of 32 sonatas, and all five of his concertos. In 1997, US classical music magazine Fanfare called him "the best pianist currently playing", and he was an made an Officer of the Order of Canada the following year. BBC Radio 3 also named him one of the 50 Great Pianists in 2012. Now 75, he was performing at the Coral Gables Congregational Church in Miami when he was taken ill. Audience member Dorothy Hindman said the pianist "spoke intelligently and humorously" before the recital, which focussed on Beethoven's lesser-known works. He started playing Rondo in G major, Op 51, No 29 with an "exceptionally clear tone", she added, and his repetition of the closing theme was initially interpreted "as a private musical joke". But "Kuerti's growing disorientation and numerous stops and starts during the second of the Eleven Bagatelles, Op 119, signalled clearly to the large audience that something was terribly wrong". Writing in the South Florida Classical Review, Hindman said the stricken musician received a standing ovation as he left the stage. There was no further information on his condition at the time of writing. </body>

      <title>An American in Paris heads to stage</title>
      <description>Gene Kelly film An American in Paris is being adapted for the stage and will premiere in Paris late next year.</description>

      <body>Gene Kelly film An American in Paris is being adapted for the stage and will premiere in Paris late next year. The 1951 film, notable for its score by George and Ira Gershwin, follows a GI falling in love in post-war Paris. The stage adaptation will include the famous 16-minute ballet sequence between Kelly and co-star Lesley Caron, reconceived by director and choreographer Christopher Wheeldon. The musical is expected to transfer to Broadway in 2015. The estates of the Gershwin brothers have been trying to develop a stage musical of An American in Paris for two decades, hoping to recreate the success of 1992's Tony-winning musical Crazy for You and last year's adaptation of Porgy and Bess. At their suggestion, US producer Stuart Oken and partner Van Kaplan have joined forces with Jean-Luc Choplin, of Paris' Theatre du Chatelet - where the musical will open - who was separately seeking the rights for a stage adaptation. "The Chatelet is more than a place to do the show," Mr Oken told the New York Times, "Though who wouldn't want to do An American in Paris in Paris, and to bring that feel to our show." Casting has yet to be announced. Wheeldon, a star at New York's City Ballet, previously created a ballet set to the music of the film for the company. The choreographer, who has never previously directed on Broadway, remains best known for his work on the 2002 musical adaptation Sweet Smell of Success. </body>

      <body>American film director Michael Bay has been injured in an attack in Hong Kong while filming on the set of his latest Transformers film. Two men have been arrested on suspicion of blackmail and assault after they demanded money from the film crew, police have said. Mr Bay, 48, received injuries to the right side of his face. But he declined to seek treatment and continued filming in a busy area of Hong Kong island. A local newspaper in Hong Kong reported that three men caused what it called "a huge disturbance" to the filming of the American science-fiction film. It said that the men could have missed out on disturbance fees which the film crew paid to shop and business owners whose businesses were likely to be affected during filming. The two men approached Mr Bay on the set during filming, a police spokeswoman told Reuters. One of them demanded payment of HK$100,000 ($13,000; £8,000). As the discussion continued, the man assaulted Mr Bay and also attacked three police officers who tried to intervene, police say. The officers received treatment at hospital for minor injuries. Police also arrested a third man at the scene. There has been no comment from Mr Bay or his crew on the incident. The fourth instalment of the Transformers franchise starring Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz is scheduled for public release in June 2014. Hong Kong's striking Victoria Harbour is believed to be among the film's locations, along with the city's dense and bustling streets. </body>

      <body>American character actor Ed Lauter, recently seen in the Oscar-winning The Artist, has died aged 74, it has been announced. Lauter played chauffer to the female character Peppy Miller, played by Oscar nominee actress Berenice Bejo. Publicist Edward Lozzi said Lauter died on Wednesday of mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lung, commonly caused by asbestos exposure. He also starred in ER and opposite Burt Reynolds in 1974's The Longest Yard. Released under the title of The Mean Machine in the UK, Lauter played a sadistic prison guard whose team squares up to Reynolds' team of misfit convicts in a game of American Football. He also starred in a 2005 remake, starring Adam Sandler. The original landed him a starring role in Alfred Hitchcock's final movie Family Plot in 1976. Last year, Lauter starred with Clint Eastwood and Justin Timberlake in the baseball movie Trouble With the Curve. The actor, who started out as a stand up comic was also famed for his impersonations of movie stars. Lozzi told the Hollywood Reporter: "He called me as Clint Eastwood from the set of Trouble With the Curve last year. We really thought it was Eastwood!" He was also known to do impersonations of black and white stars James Cagney and Humphrey Bogart. Born in Long Island, New York in 1938, Lauter made his Broadway debut in the original 1968 stage production of The Great White Hope, which also starred James Earl Jones. His TV debut was came in a 1971 episode of private eye series Mannix and he made his first big screen appearance in the Western, Dirty Little Billy. Standing at 6ft 2in and prematurely bald with a long, square face, Lauter was often cast as thugs or stern authority figures. He was quoted as saying: "I like those roles. Lee Marvin once told me, 'When you play a heavy, every once in a while make the audience like you a little bit. Then they'll think, 'Wait a minute, he's not such a bad guy. Did you see the way he petted that dog?'" Lauter played the recurring character Dick Healy in the US version of Shameless and had several projects in post-production. A charitable foundation is being established to honour his work and an annual scholarship fund will be awarded to aspiring young actors. His family, which includes four children and his wife of eight years, Mia, have asked that donations be made to the foundation. </body>

      <body>US filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen have received France's highest cultural honour at a ceremony in Paris. The brothers, who won three Oscars in 2008 for their crime drama No Country For Old Men, were each made a Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters. Accepting the award, Joel said: "Sometimes life plays jokes on you - some of them are very unfortunate, some of them are very fortunate. "This is one of the most fortunate jokes I think life has played on us." The award is given by the French government to people who "significantly contributed to the enrichment of the French cultural inheritance". Eight of the Coen's films have premiered at the Cannes Film Festival, with 1991's Barton Fink winning the Palme d'Or. Their latest film, Inside Llewyn Davis, also won the Grand Prize of the jury at this year's festival. Released in the UK next January and starring Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake, the film tells the story of a struggling singer-songwriter against the backdrop of the 1960s New York folk scene. French Culture Minister Aurelie Filippetti, who presented the honour to the pair, said: "We have extremely strong links between French cinema and American cinema so it's natural there's this recognition for two of the greatest directors in the US today." Other recent recipients of the honour from the world of film and music include Ringo Starr, Bono and Bruce Willis. </body>

      <description>Child abduction thriller Prisoners holds on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million.</description>

      <body>Child abduction thriller Prisoners has held on to the top spot on the UK box office chart in a weekend that saw no release make more than £1 million. The Hugh Jackman movie remained the UK's number one picture for the third week in succession, despite making only £968,990 between Friday and Sunday. Its takings were almost twice that of WikiLeaks drama The Fifth Estate, which opened in a disappointing sixth place. The film made £502,495 in its first three days in UK and Ireland cinemas. Previews of animated movie Turbo, not included in this week's chart, are understood to have taken more than any title in the official Top 15. The DreamWorks release officially opens in the UK on Thursday and will have its preview takings added to its first weekend tally. The lacklustre landscape allowed Edinburgh-based musical Sunshine on Leith to claim second place in this week's chart after opening last week at three. Dexter Fletcher's film, which features songs by Scottish sibling duo The Proclaimers, took £732,296 in its second weekend on release. Woody Allen's Blue Jasmine is ranked at number three with a third weekend tally of £642,241. The film, which boasts an Oscar-tipped performance by Cate Blanchett, has now made £3.33m, making it Allen's most profitable title ever at the UK and Ireland box office. With Filth at four and Rush at five, The Fifth Estate held the dubious honour of being this week's highest new entry. This is despite a major promotional push and the presence of Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch as WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange. Its failure to woo UK audiences was further underlined by the performance of marital drama Le Week-End at number seven. On a screen-for-screen basis, Roger Michell's film - which stars Jim Broadbent and Lindsay Duncan as a long-married couple spending a weekend in Paris - made more than twice as much as its tech-savvy rival. Further down the chart, action sequel Machete Kills languished in 12th place with a three-day tally of £165,586. Its takings were only marginally superior to those recorded by Romeo and Juliet, an adaptation of the William Shakespeare play by Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes, whose £137,448 tally saw it open outside this week's Top 15. </body>

      <body>Liam Gallagher has said it was an easy decision to take part in a special concert in memory of The Charlatans' drummer Jon Brookes. Mr Brookes, 44, who was diagnosed with a brain tumour three years ago, died in August. The Charlatans will perform alongside other guests at the Royal Albert hall on Friday night in aid of The Brain Tumour Charity. Liam Gallagher described the musician as a "good lad". "He didn't have an ego, do you know what I mean? "I wouldn't claim to be his best mate and that. I only met him through the gigs we've done, but every time I met him I had a splendid time." Gallagher said he was on holiday at the time the concert was announced, but said he signed up straight away. He will be performing alongside fellow former Oasis band mates Andy Bell, Paul "Bonehead" Arthurs and Chris Sharrock, as well as Jay Mehler, currently part of Gallagher's band Beady Eye. West Midlands indie band The Charlatans said they organised the gig as a "fitting tribute" to founding member Mr Brookes, originally from Staffordshire. Keyboard player Tony Rogers said in some ways the event would be a tough night, when the reality of their friend's death "will hit home". "He was always very upbeat. His illness never got on top of him, he never let it get to him. He was always very positive and never moaned," Rogers said. "It's not like he's gone really. It's like his spirit is still there. It will be a tough one I think, but every time you think of Jon it puts a smile on your face." The Brain Tumour Charity's chairman Andy Foote said: "One of our biggest challenges is raising awareness of the disease, because the general public are not aware of the facts and they're quite startling. "For example, brain tumours kill more people under the age of 40 than any other cancer, yet less than 2% of funding that goes into cancer research goes into brain tumours." </body>

      <title>Morrissey opens up in autobiography</title>

      <body>Former Smiths singer Morrissey has used his autobiography to criticise the UK legal system and music business; and revealed his first full relationship came with a man when he was in his 30s. The star was scathing about the judges in his 1990s legal battle with former bandmate Mike Joyce, describing one as the "pride of the pipsqueakery". The Smiths' record label Rough Trade, he said, had been "brutally drab". And he accused music paper NME of being out to "get Morrissey" in the 1990s. The star, who is normally protective of his private life, opened up about a relationship with Jake Walters that began in 1994. He wrote about how Walters followed him back to his house after meeting him at a restaurant and "steps inside and stays for two years". "For the first time in my life the eternal 'I' becomes 'we', as, finally, I can get on with someone," he wrote. He also revealed how he later discussed having a baby - or, as he put it, a "mewling miniature monster" - with Tina Dehgani, with whom he described having an "uncluttered commitment". Giving his version of his 1996 court battle with Joyce, who was seeking 25% of The Smiths' earnings, Morrissey accused the drummer of "constant inaccuracies and assumptions vomited out with leaden fatigue" in court. The group, one of the most revered bands in British music, split up in 1987 after five years together. The presiding judge, John Weeks, came in for particularly scathing criticism, portrayed caustically in the book as an "unsmiling Lord of the Hunt, with an immutable understanding of the world of The Smiths". "The pride of the pipsqueakery, John Weeks begins his judgment by falling flat on his face: He brilliantly announces to the world how The Smiths formed in 1992 - his judicial accuracy not to be questioned!" Morrissey wrote. Geoff Travis, who signed The Smiths to Rough Trade, was another who failed to impress Morrissey. When the singer and guitarist Johnny Marr turned up for an appointment, Morrissey claims he waved them away and refused to listen to their music until Marr "pinned him to the swivel chair". Travis, Morrissey drily noted, "would have found himself wandering from kaftan to kaftan" if it had not been for The Smiths, who the singer claimed "saved his life and made it count in the long run". The singer's bitter and long-running row with the NME began, he said, when a new editor took over and "allegedly called a staff meeting at which he has passed the command that his staff writers must now 'get Morrissey'". In 1992, the magazine questioned whether he was racist after he appeared on stage with a Union Jack. It put him on its cover under the headline: "Flying the flag or flirting with disaster?" The singer also detailed the brutality of teachers at St Mary's school in Stretford, Manchester, where each day was "Kafka-esque in its nightmare". One teacher, he recounted, "stands and stares and stands and stares" at naked boys in the shower, while another was recalled for the way he rubbed anti-inflammatory cream into the young Morrissey's wrist after he had fallen over. "At 14, I understand the meaning of the unnecessarily slow and sensual strokes, with eyes fixed to mine," Morrissey wrote. The autobiography was published on Thursday as a Penguin Classic. It had been due for release in September, but was delayed by what Morrissey described as "a last-minute content disagreement". </body>

      <title>Mark Thompson recalled to face MPs</title>
      <description>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson is ordered to answer parliamentary questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative, which was scrapped at a cost of £100m.</description>

      <body>Former BBC director general Mark Thompson has been ordered to answer MPs' questions over the corporation's failed Digital Media Initiative (DMI). The project, which was designed to do away with tapes and digitise the BBC's archives, was abandoned in May at a cost of £98.4m The Public Accounts Committee said on Wednesday it was "dismayed" by the collapse and would investigate further. It intends to ask Mr Thompson whether MPs were misled about the scheme. The former director general told the committee in February 2011 the DMI project was "on track" and there were "many programmes being made" with it. He also ruled out any "significant further delays" in its introduction, and added: "I think you are going to see a broader deployment of the system across the BBC than we expected, because of the enthusiasm with which it is being used". Later that month, the National Audit Office reported DMI had "progressed well" after the BBC took control of the project from technology firm Siemens. However in May this year, the entire initiative was scrapped. The BBC Trust said it had "delivered little or no assets" and should be shut down to prevent "throwing good money after bad". "This is, on a personal level, probably the most seriously embarrassing thing I've ever seen," BBC Trustee Anthony Fry told the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee in June. In a statement, Mr Thompson insisted his 2011 testimony had been given "honestly and in good faith". He added: "I did so on the basis of information provided to me at the time by the BBC executives responsible for delivering the project." No date has been set for his appearance in front of the committee, although the meeting will not take place until next year. It will be the second time he has been called to answer MPs questions since becoming chief executive of the New York Times, following his previous testimony on BBC management pay-offs in September. A spokesman for the committee said Mr Thompson was "happy to come and give evidence" again, although he may appear by video link if necessary - and that other witnesses would also be called. The BBC Trust has asked accountancy firm PriceWaterhouseCoopers to complete an independent review into the DMI failure. The National Audit Office may also compile a report next year. </body>

      <body>Glee creator Ryan Murphy has confirmed the musical show will end after the next series, it has been reported. Speaking at a media event in Los Angeles, Murphy said he had planned for the sixth season to revolve around the characters of Rachel and Finn. However, following the death of actor Cory Monteith, who played Finn, in July, he was forced to create a new ending, TV Line reported. He added he had penned a new finale that would be in Monteith's honour. "The final year of the show, which will be next year, was designed around Rachel and Cory/Finn's story," Murphy said. "I always knew that, I always knew how it would end. I knew what the last shot was - he was in it. I knew what the last line was - she said it to him. "So when a tragedy like that happens you sort of have to pause and figure out what you want to do, so we're figuring that out now." Murphy said he planned to pitch his new ending for the show to US network Fox later this month. "I think it's very satisfactory and kind of in [Monteith's] honour, which I love," he added. The show said goodbye to the actor in a special tribute episode broadcast in the US last week. In April this year, Fox renewed Glee for a fifth and sixth season as part of a two-season deal. It had been hinted the sixth series could be the last, however it was not confirmed at the time. </body>

      <body>Brian Sibley is one of writing's multi-hyphenates. He is a prolific and award-winning writer of radio drama, such as Radio 4's acclaimed Lord of the Rings adaptations. He has written plays of his own and many books focusing on film. The subjects of his biographies range from CS Lewis to Mickey Mouse. In fact, a love of Disney has been central since childhood. At home his walls are plastered with Disney artwork. "In the 1980s, it was exciting to be flown over to LA to sit in script conferences at Disney, working on what looked like a marvellous project - the studio's second Poppins movie." Though the screenplay he wrote with PL Travers was never made, he looks back on the experience fondly. And he's in a unique position to explain what she really thought about the 1964 film. "I first corresponded with Pamela Travers in the 1970s, when I was writing a book about Walt Disney. I didn't get to meet her for a decade but when finally we met it quickly became a friendship. "Since she died, Pamela's been painted as an old dragon but it's not true: I'd go round for tea on a Sunday and she was great company. Writing with her turned out to be an eccentric experience but that was because she remained proprietorial about Mary Poppins. "But why shouldn't she be? - it was her creation. Though Pamela, who was very spiritual, would probably have said that the character had been given to her." The first Poppins film had been a massive hit. "But in some ways it's quite a loose adaptation, " Brian Sibley says. "Her books were really collections of free-standing short stories. The first film used elements both of the original Mary Poppins book (published 1934) and the second one, Mary Poppins Comes Back. "The Disney studio had been very keen to make a sequel but Pamela always said no. One Sunday we were having tea when she mentioned they'd been in contact. She described the latest idea to me and said she was about to reject it." "I said it was a pity there couldn't be a new film - so many people had loved the Mary Poppins character. Pamela said 'Oh I could only agree if I could do it on my own terms. I'd have to work with someone I trust.' And she paused. 'If it were you dear that would be different." "So I wrote a letter to Roy Disney (Walt's nephew, by now in charge) who I had met a few times. This was the 1980s and people still wrote letters. I told him there might be a chance of making the film. After a couple of days I got news Roy was sending someone to London to talk to me. Within a fortnight we were working on an outline." The project was Mary Poppins Comes Back, based on those parts of Travers' second book unused in 1964. Disney contracted Sibley and Travers to supply a treatment which they then set to work to expand. "For months I would sit and talk with Pamela at her home in Chelsea about the ideas I had. Then she would give me notes on what Mary Poppins would or would not do and think. She was very particular, even down to how a line should be said. I recorded her on tape and went away. Of course I then wrote what I needed to write - but I always bore her comments in mind. I would give her my script pages and she would write notes all over it. Some parts came back with 'no No NO!' scrawled all over the page. But she also said when she liked what I'd written." Sibley thinks they managed to find a balance between what Travers had written in her books and what the Poppins character then became in the film. But he also sensed a cloud looming over the movie's chances of getting made - the thorny issue of casting. "It was more than twenty years since the original so who could play Mary? Julie Andrews was no longer in her twenties and she had moved a long way from the My Fair Lady - Sound of Music stage of her career. Disney made an approach but it came to nothing. And who could ever have played Mary Poppins half as well?" Casting the world's most famous nanny was not the only quandary. "In our screenplay there was no longer a Bert (as played by Dick van Dyke). Instead there was Bert's brother, who had a similar function of being Mary's friend and possible admirer. Finding a Bert replacement was almost as tricky as re-casting the lead role. "I remember sitting in a restaurant on Rodeo Drive listening to an executive explain they thought Michael Jackson might be right for the part. Bear in mind this was an ice-cream seller in a park in Edwardian London. Or maybe it would have worked - who knows?" And contrary to popular belief, Sibley insists it's untrue that PL Travers hated the original film. "She may have mellowed in her views by the time I knew her but she knew there were good things in it. When we got down to work I thought it would be a good idea if we watched the original film first so I arranged a private screening. "I asked Pamela how long it was since she'd seen Poppins - this was the mid-1980s. She said 'Well not since the premiere, obviously'. I was astonished she hadn't seen this hugely famous film for more than twenty years. But Pamela didn't have a video or even a TV set. "Throughout the film she gave me notes. There were one or two moments where she said 'Oh that's terrible'. But there were more where she got excited at what was up there on screen. She patted my hand and said 'Oh we must remember that, that's excellent, I like that bit very much...' And that's how we began to build our screenplay." Eventually the sequel fell victim to a combination of inherent casting problems and the fact that new executives were running Disney. "But I treasured my time working with PL Travers," Sibley says. "And we stayed in touch almost until she died. She was demanding as a friend. But she had great wisdom and great knowledge of so many things: literature, life, love, faith. She was prickly and difficult at times. But she was also someone of a towering intellect whose friendship I really valued." </body>

      <title>Stage revival of film giant Laughton</title>
      <description>The Thick of It star on spin doctors and screen legends</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24580390</url>

      <body>He made his name as an insufferable spin doctor in political satire The Thick of It and a plain-speaking manager in the BBC's Twenty Twelve. Now actor Vincent Franklin is on stage portraying one of Britain's greatest film stars, Charles Laughton. The legend of Charles Laughton has faded in the 50 years since his death, but the actor was among Britain's first Hollywood superstars, a giant of the silver screen from the 1930s onwards. Whether playing Henry VIII - a role that won him an Oscar in 1934 - or Rembrandt, Captain Bligh or Quasimodo, he was regarded by many as the greatest character actor of his age. "I certainly felt very excited about the idea of playing Laughton when I was asked to do it," explains Vincent Franklin. "Then within a week of being asked, when I'd started to read some books, I thought, this is the most arrogant thing I've ever agreed to do. "If somebody said to an actor, 'Do you want to play Laurence Olivier? Do you want to play Gielgud? Do you want to play De Niro?' you'd go, 'No I'm not going to play De Niro. Unless you're as good as De Niro how can you possibly play De Niro?' "But somehow I'd foolishly gone, 'Yeah, I'll play Charles Laughton.'" Laughton was born in the Yorkshire seaside resort of Scarborough and it is in the actor's home town that Franklin is bringing the Laughton legend back to life. A private and insecure person, Laughton never gave interviews. In the play, Franklin attempts to peel back the screen persona to reveal the real man. "He was an extraordinary lost soul," Franklin says. "As a fat, bald, northern actor myself, the idea that you can be an actor is fine. "But the idea that a man who is by his own [admission] an ugly man can become a film star is quite extraordinary. "On the surface of it, he's an extraordinary, successful human being. But on the inside it's a man who struggled with his own religious beliefs, struggled with his sexuality and struggled with self-loathing while at the same time being a true artist." The play, titled Laughton, is at Scarborough's Stephen Joseph Theatre, which was run by Alan Ayckbourn for 37 years. On display in the foyer is a photograph of Laughton, the guest of honour when the building was opened as a cinema in 1936. Franklin, from Bradford, was most recently seen playing Labour whip Michael Cocks in the National Theatre's 1970s political drama This House. But he is most recognisable from his TV roles as the no-nonsense head of contracts Nick Jowett in Olympic spoof Twenty Twelve and the all-nonsense Conservative PR guru Stewart Pearson in The Thick of It. The insufferably smug Pearson likes nothing better than to "imagineer the narrative" or "take a few turns on the ideas carousel". The Thick of It looks to be on indefinite recess now that Peter Capaldi, who played Pearson's expletive-slinging nemesis Malcolm Tucker, has been cast as Doctor Who. Writer Armando Iannucci recently said the show "has quietly been put in its box". "There's room for some specials," Franklin believes. "Whether Malcolm Tucker will be able to come back from Alpha Centauri or wherever he's been taken in the Tardis I don't know, but I hope so. "I regularly meet some people from it and there is a real sense of, 'It would be nice to do one more, wouldn't it?'" Unusually for an actor, Franklin also has a real job - a decade ago, he founded a company called Quietroom, which advises companies and government departments on how to communicate clearly. In that capacity, he is the anti-Stewart Pearson. "We improvise quite a lot of The Thick of It and quite a lot of what I do is the exact opposite of what I would tell someone to do [at Quietroom]," he says. For someone who advises people how to communicate, Franklin is suitably conscious of his choice of words as an interviewee. At one point he warns, "I'm just going to ramble for a moment now" and regularly checks: "Does that make sense?" When Quietroom works for the government, there are some startled reactions when Franklin pops up in Whitehall between acting jobs, he says. "Between the last government and this one, I went in to do an audit of the language the Treasury was using in things like the Budget and their website," the actor says. "I had my Stewart Pearson beard on - because that's my beard - and I do get very strange looks from people walking around the Treasury or HMRC [Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs] from people going, 'Satan lives!' "What's great about this show is that its biggest fans are people who work in government. Real MPs do want to come and have their picture taken with you, which always seems really bizarre to me." Back in Scarborough, Franklin praises Laughton's writer, the author and geologist Roger Osborne, for his use of language. "So much of what we do in life is about reading stuff and understanding what lies behind it," he says. "Does that make sense? Whether that's us buying an insurance project or playing Charles Laughton. So choosing the right words is really important." Laughton is at the Stephen Joseph Theatre in Scarborough until 26 October. </body>

      <body>Living for two years in Paris changed Vincent van Gogh. He might not have realised it at the time, but as he met other artists in the French capital, he gradually moved away from his dark, sombre Dutch works - towards much brighter palettes and expressive brush work. Van Gogh's transitional story is currently being told at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London - with paintings by the artist and his contemporaries on show. Take a look with gallery partner, Nicholas Maclean. Van Gogh in Paris can be seen at the Eykyn Maclean Gallery in central London, until 29 November 2013. Reservations required.

      <title>Lech Walesa: 'I only fear God, and my wife'</title>
      <description>What does the former Solidarity leader make of his biopic?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24538140</url>
      <date>1382082115</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70494000/jpg/_70494898_walesa_-002.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>In the space of a few months, Lech Walesa went from being an electrician in a Polish shipyard to one of the most famous faces in global politics. So how does he feel about the new film of his life? Early on in the biopic Walesa: Man of Hope, a character describes Lech Walesa as being "full of contradictions and surprises". Walesa, in the UK to promote the film at the London Film Festival, smiles when I quote the line back at him. "I am a man of surprises," he says. "That's why I won. I surprised the communists, I surprised Yeltsin, I surprised many presidents." And then, after a pause, he adds: "I had a lot of luck as well." Walesa: Man of Hope is acclaimed Polish director Andrzej Wajda's companion piece to his Man of Marble (1976) and Man of Iron (1981). The film charts Walesa's life from the bloody suppression of the 1970 workers' protests through to the founding of the Solidarity union in 1980, the imposition of Martial Law in 1981, and the eventual fall of communism. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 and was elected president of Poland in 1990 (although the film stops before this point). Wajda has described Wałesa as "the most difficult subject I have ever dealt with" in his 55 years of film-making. "I just don't see any other director making a movie about Lech that I would find satisfying. I have no other choice," he said in his director's statement. Although Walesa is helping to promote the biopic, he kept his distance when it was being made. "I didn't interfere and I didn't want to get involved with the film-making," he explains. "Wajda needed to finish off and underline communism." In the film, Walesa is played by Polish theatre and film actor Robert Wieckiewicz whose on-screen likeness to the moustachioed union leader is uncanny. Wieckiewicz's Walesa comes across as both a charismatic and contradictory figure. At one point his character admits: "I am a man of great internal anger." The film picks up Walesa's life story in 1970 as the communist authorities put down the workers' protests, and Wałesa is forced to sign a paper agreeing to be an informer. The following scenes showing his path to political maturity and its impact on his family life and relationship with his wife Danuta (Agnieszka Grochowska). Wieckiewicz didn't meet Walesa as preparation for the role. Their first encounter was at this year's Venice Film Festival. The actor wasn't concerned he was portraying such a well-known figure, and one who is still alive. "For me he is just a man, a worker, a husband and father. Of course he is a leader and a very smart, intelligent man and Nobel prize winner," he says. "So I approached this role in the same way as any other role. Read the script and try and capture the different levels of the character." He remembers being a teenager in 1980 and hearing about the Gdansk shipyard strike on Radio Free Europe. He went to Gdansk on holiday and recalls the "atmosphere of freedom" in the Baltic seaport city. "You could say whatever you wanted without censorship. For the first time in my life I could breath. "Walesa was like a man from Mars, a super-hero. People understood him. He was like us. " He acknowledges the post-presidential Walesa remains a controversial figure. "He is not an easy man to manage. He doesn't want to shut his mouth. He is still active in political sense. Sometimes he says something tricky. "Polish society is divided between people who still believe he is a hero and others who think he is a traitor." He adds: "In the history of the world there are a lot of people who are icons - like [Nelson] Mandela - because they did something very important for other people in the world. Walesa is, in my opinion, among them." Walesa remains enigmatic when asked what he thinks of his portrayal on the big screen. "I have no opinion. I'm going to allow the viewers to make their minds up." How hard did he find balancing his life as a family man with being a political activist? "It was very hard because I always want to be the best. I'm not sure if it worked. I was born to be number one. "I don't have regrets I didn't spend more time with my family because I've lived my life to the full and you can't look back in regret." Walesa points out there could be "another 30 films" made about his life. "This is one viewpoint, but there are many different viewpoints. This is only two hours of my 70 years. "You could make a lot more films about what happened. Time will show whether this is a good film or not." What is not in doubt from the film is in taking on the authorities, Walesa placed himself in great danger. During the arrests and interrogations, how afraid was he? "I'm a man of faith," he replies. "I only fear God, and my wife - sometimes." Walesa: Man of Hope is out in the UK on 18 October </body>

      <title>Why academics are taking comic books seriously</title>
      <description>The academics in thrall to formerly "throwaway" literature</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24458521</url>

      <body>Thousands of comic fans are descending on a small Cumbrian town this weekend for an international festival. Among them will be a growing number of academics who are now taking the art form - previously regarded by many as "throwaway" - as seriously as other literature. With Batman, Superman and The Avengers dominating box offices after making the leap from the page to the big screen, comic-inspired characters have been making a comeback for years. But it is not just cinema-goers who are drawn to the exploits of cartoon creations. Academics are also taking an increasing interest in the world of comics and graphic novels. There are now thought to be about 150 comic scholars in the UK - university lecturers, PhD students and independent researchers. They are exploring how subjects such as gender, feminism, history and mental and physical health are portrayed. Dr Mel Gibson, a comic book expert at Northumbria University, said the genre had "matured" in the 1980s, mainly thanks to British writers such as Bryan Talbot, Alan Moore and Grant Morrison. "That's also when academics got involved. But it's not ivory tower stuff, it's rooted in the real world. It has practical applications," she said. Dr Gibson is one of 50 leading figures from the world of graphic novels who will be appearing at the inaugural Lakes International Comic Art Festival in Kendal from Friday until Sunday. With writers, artists and industry figures coming from as far afield as Japan, the United States and Scandinavia, the event promises to transform the picturesque Cumbrian market town. While there are still only a handful of courses across the UK dedicated solely to comics and graphic novels, Dr Gibson says they find their way into many traditional undergraduate subjects. "Some of my final-year students are looking at children's literature and as part of that they will explore comics and graphic novels," she said. "They can even be included in social work studies and paediatric nursing - Bryan Talbot's The Tale of One Bad Rat has been used by health professionals around the world dealing with people who have suffered childhood abuse. "The victims might not want to or be able to talk about their situation, but through the story they can begin a discussion. That's a valuable tool for a health worker to have in their arsenal." The Tale of One Bad Rat, written in 1994, tells the story of a girl who flees London to escape sexual abuse at the hands of her father. "That is the graphic novel I'm most proud of," said Talbot. "I still get people today writing to me to say they were abused and that the book helped them cope." The 61-year-old - a founding patron of the Lakes event - is a doyen of the comic art world. Originally from Wigan, he has lived in Sunderland for the past 15 years with his wife Mary, an academic-turned-graphic novelist, and the pair won the Costa 2012 biography prize after teaming up for Dotter of Her Father's Eyes. It was with one of the first British graphic novels, The Adventures of Luther Arkwright, that Talbot made his name in the late 1970s. A story of parallel worlds, it features several nods to the poet William Blake. More recently, 2007's Alice in Sunderland explored the links between the North East city and author Lewis Carroll, mixing myth and history along the way. In recognition of his work, Bryan was given an honorary doctorate by Sunderland University in 2009 while last year he was presented with an honorary degree of doctor of letters by Northumbria University. "Academic interest has grown over the years and I'm proud," he said. "Someone once sent me a PhD thesis they had written about Luther Arkwright and its historical elements. "When I started working in comics it was almost like working at the bottom of the artistic barrel. To most people they were only just more interesting than patterned toilet paper. "Steadily they gained credibility, but that's down to the talent of the writers and illustrators. If the novels weren't any good then no one would be taking any notice of them." Taking inspiration from the annual Angouleme International Comics Festival in France - which draws 250,000 fans - the Lakes event will feature ticketed exhibitions, workshops and panels, as well as a programme of free family-friendly events. Venues across the town will stage sessions, shops are displaying artwork by schoolchildren and college students while the town hall will even replace its Union flag with one bearing the Batman logo. Talbot's latest work, again in partnership with his wife Mary, as well as illustrator Kate Charlesworth, is Sally Heathcote: Suffragette - a tale following a maid-of-all-work and the fight for the vote in Edwardian Britain. For academics such as Dr Gibson, gender is a key area of study. "Sally Heathcote is an example of a strong central female character - something comics are now very good at," she said. "For a while it was forgotten that girls read comics, much less that they were represented within them. "In the 1960s publications such as Jackie featured comic strips, but they disappeared over a period of 20 years and those titles began to steer girls towards magazines like Cosmopolitan rather than comics, which is different to the way boys' reading patterns were shaped." For Dr Gibson the move from a niche, underground offering to graphic novels being seen by many as having mainstream educational appeal is a welcome one. "Graphic novels were once seen as throwaway, but now they are more highly valued and viewed as things which deserve space on the bookshelf." </body>

      <title>Minister: Police culture will change</title>
      <description>Policing will become more open, with independent overseers given more powers to stamp out wrongdoing, a Home Office minister says.</description>

      <body>The "culture" of policing will improve, with independent overseers given "more powers" to investigate wrongdoing, a Home Office minister has pledged. Damian Green said the "Plebgate" investigation was "one incident among many", citing the Hillsborough cover-up and the death of Ian Tomlinson. But only a small minority of officers had acted inappropriately, he added. The Independent Police Complaints Commission was working to ensure greater "openness", Mr Green said. A Sunday Times poll by YouGov suggests 66% of the public trust the police, down from 71% in August. The figures come after several controversies involving police over the last few years. In August the Metropolitan Police apologised to the family of Ian Tomlinson over his death at the G20 protests in London in 2009, with one officer using "excessive" force. Last year David Cameron apologised for a police cover-up over the Hillsborough disaster, in which 96 football fans died in 1989. And, on Wednesday, the chief constables of West Mercia, Warwickshire and West Midlands Police are due to appear before the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee to explain the handling of a meeting between officers and former government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell. The MP resigned after he was accused of calling Downing Street police "plebs" when they prevented him from riding a bicycle through gates leading into Whitehall in September last year. The meeting with officers, working as representatives of the Police Federation, was held during the weeks following the claims. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made shows that, while he admitted swearing, he denied using the word "pleb" or insulting the police. But, after the meeting, three senior police officers said he had refused to elaborate on what had happened and should quit, which he later did. Mr Green said the officers' comments had been "palpably untrue", adding: "He deserves an apology." Mr Green added: "Andrew Mitchell clearly can command the resources that other people might not be able to prove that what individual police officers said about him wasn't true. So that's the key underlying issue." Mr Green said: "If police officers behave badly then it's really serious for the police. But it's a very small minority who behave badly. By and large the police do their job well." Citing the Sunday Times poll, he added: "Two-thirds of people still have confidence in the police, which is quite surprising given the spate of stories." However, the government was increasing resources for the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) and was changing police recruitment to ensure people with a background from outside the service could enter at a senior level. Mr Green said: "The fact that people will bring a new attitude and background will help the police service. It will open it up." He added: "The IPCC needs more powers and resources, We are giving it both. It's not just a question of following rules. It's a question of having a culture of openness and transparency." Former Metropolitan Police detective Peter Kirkham told the BBC's Sunday Politics there was not a "culture of deceit" among officers. Communities Secretary Eric Pickles told BBC One's Sunday Politics he had "always believed" Mr Mitchell's account of Plebgate. "I'd be honoured to sit with Andrew Mitchell in the cabinet," he said. </body>

      <title>Bank 'has room to raise UK rates'</title>
      <description>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners on the Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers.</description>

      <body>The Bank of England could raise interest rates a "fair amount" without hurting homeowners taking up the government's Help to Buy scheme, according to one of its policymakers. Ben Broadbent, who is on the committee that decides rates, was asked how rate rises would affect those new borrowers. "I think there is a fair amount they could go up before borrowers got into great difficulties," he told Sky News. But he added that a rate rise must not be allowed to "choke off" recovery. Rates would only go up if the economy was in good health - or if inflation was out of control, said Mr Broadbent. "We want to ensure that this recovery continues and is not choked off by a premature rise in interest rates," he told Sky News. Interest rates have been at a record low 0.5% since 2009. A rise in interest rates would mean an increase in mortgage payments for most homeowners, which could lead to a rise in repossessions if people were unable to afford the higher monthly payments. Under the second phase of the Help to Buy scheme, which is now in place, borrowers across the UK can put down a deposit of as little as 5% of the property price. The government provides a seven-year taxpayer guarantee to the lender covering 15% of the loan value. It is available for properties sold for up to £600,000 in the UK. There are concerns that Help to Buy may lead to another housing bubble and borrowers could get into trouble when rates do eventually rise. Mr Broadbent told Sky News that "the numbers entering this [Help to Buy] scheme are relatively low and although interest rates will, as you say, at some point start to rise, it is worth remembering quite how low a level we are starting from." Last week, the Bank's chief economist, Spencer Dale, said that economic conditions are unlikely to improve enough to merit a rise in rates next year. In a QandA on Twitter, Mr Dale said: "Rates will only rise when had sustained period of strong growth as long as no risk to stability." He was also asked how many mortgage repossessions there'll be when interest rates return to long-term average. "Don't know," he replied. "But when we raise interest rates economy should be stronger, higher employment, higher real wages." Mr Dale and Mr Broadbent are two of the nine people at the Bank who set monetary policy. In its last minutes, the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) said it would make no change to the £375bn of monetary stimulus it is providing through its quantitative easing (QE) programme. The programme, brought in to give an extra stimulus because interest rates could barely be cut below the current 0.5%, has been criticised by some for helping the financial markets and the banks, by making money cheap, rather than the economy as a whole. </body>

      <body>Criminals who trade in child abuse images are to be targeted in a new British-American task force. Police Minister Damian Green will fly to the US later to formalise arrangements for the new body. The agency will be co-chaired by Mr Green and US Attorney General Eric Holder. Mr Green said: "Child abuse and exploitation online are not restricted by borders and our efforts to combat them should not be either." He went on: "British and American parents rightly expect us to do all we can to protect our children and that is why I want to agree to a much closer working relationship in this area. "This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this sickening crime." Mr Green will sign a memorandum of understanding between the two countries in the next few days. The Sun on Sunday reported that as part of the trip Mr Green will meet senior figures within the FBI, Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies. Internet companies are also being called on to share information with their British counterparts. The move follows the 22 July announcement from Prime Minister David Cameron that most households would have sexually explicit material blocked by the internet provider unless they chose to opt out. Joanna Shields, UK business ambassador for Digital Industries and a former Google and Facebook executive, will be the industry lead for the project. She told the Sun on Sunday: "The US-UK Taskforce will play a critical role in taking forward the Prime Minister's commitment to eradicating exploitative material from the internet and keeping our children safe online. "I strongly believe that industry and government can successfully tackle this problem together. "I look forward to working with the brightest minds in the industry to develop truly innovative and creative technical solutions that will help protect the most vulnerable in our society." </body>

      <title>Call for whistle-blowing inquiry</title>
      <description>The government should launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, Tory MP and health select committee member Charlotte Leslie says.</description>

      <body>Ministers must launch an inquiry into how whistle-blowers are treated in the wake of the Orchid View care home scandal, MP Charlotte Leslie has said. The Tory MP spoke after Lisa Martin revealed she had not worked since exposing abuse at Orchid View in Copthorne, West Sussex, in 2011. That was "an indictment of our system", Ms Leslie told BBC Radio 5 live. The government said it would be publishing plans on protecting whistle-blowers later this year. On Friday, at an inquest into 19 deaths at Orchid View, West Sussex coroner Penelope Schofield said the home was riddled with "institutionalised abuse". She ruled that neglect contributed to five of the deaths and said the home, then run by Southern Cross, was "mismanaged and understaffed". Orchid View has since reopened under a new name and new management. Ms Martin, who first told police about problems at the home, told 5 live on Saturday: "I do want to work back in care but I can't get a job in the care industry again. "Where I live is a very small village, next to Copthorne - everyone knows what went on. "It's just been an absolute nightmare for me. "Obviously I know, morally, that I did the right things. "Whether I would ever do that again - I probably wouldn't because it's had a huge impact on my life." Conservative MP Ms Leslie, who is also a member of the health select committee, told 5 live's Sunday Breakfast that Ms Martin's experience was "absolutely appalling but sadly it's becoming a recurring theme". "Whistle-blowers across the NHS and the care system do the right thing, stand up and save lives, in many cases. "And then other future employers look at them and, instead of saying, 'thank goodness - here's someone who can prevent bad things happening', they look at them and say 'here's a troublemaker'. "People who are saving lives are losing their jobs, losing their livelihoods and everything." She added: "That's why I think a whistle-blowing inquiry or review is needed into how we can ensure that whistle-blowing isn't needed - because management systems iron out these things before it gets to whistle-blowing - and how you can protect whistle-blowers." A spokesperson for the Department of Health (DoH) said staff in the health and social care sectors "should never be stopped from raising concerns about patient safety and the secretary of state for health has told trusts that doing this is unacceptable". "Staff should be able to speak out and we are determined to ensure that if individuals raise concerns about patient safety they are listened to," they added. The department said that, later this year, it would publish its response to a public inquiry report released in February into failings at Stafford Hospital which came after years of neglect led to the unnecessary deaths of hundreds of patients. Its response to the inquiry would "lay out how we plan on making sure whistle-blowers are not just protected but also praised for their courage and thanked by management". That would form "a key part of the effort to build the safe, effective and compassionate culture that patients, the public and the overwhelming majority of staff across health and social care expect", the spokesperson added. </body>

      <title>Salmond: 'Scotland's time is now'</title>
      <description>SNP leader Alex Salmond tells his party conference it is "time for independence" and that the case for voting yes will be made on 26 November.</description>

      <body>SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's conference that it was Scotland's time to be independent. During his speech to delegates gathered in Perth, he also announced that the detailed case for independence would be published on 26 November. The long-waited white paper will come ahead of the referendum itself, on 18 September next year. Mr Salmond said: "We are Scotland's independence generation and our time is now." Scotland's first minister reckoned devolution had provided a "taste of independence", but the country was now ready to make its own decisions. Mr Salmond also told the 1,000 people gathered that, under independence the national minimum wage would rise at least with the level of inflation, to help people keep pace with the cost of living. And he urged bosses at the Grangemouth petrochemical refinery, which has been temporarily shut down due to a dispute with workers to "fire up the plant". At the same time he urged union officials to drop their threat of strike action. The SNP leader said the white paper would have two functions, the first being to set out what would happen between achieving a "yes" vote in the referendum and the first elections to an independent Scottish Parliament, in the spring of 2016. He went on: "It will therefore be clear that independence is not, at its heart, about this party or this administration or this first minister but about the fundamental democratic choice for Scotland - the people's right to choose a government of their own. "Secondly, the white paper will set out our vision for Scotland - the why of independence - the Scotland that we seek. "We seek a country with a written constitution protecting not just the liberties for the people but enunciating the rights of the citizen." Mr Salmond told the conference: "We will not wake up on the morning of 19 September next year and think to ourselves what might have been. "We will wake up on that morning filled with hope and expectation - ready to build a new nation both prosperous and just. "After almost a quarter of a century moving forward to this very moment - let us ask ourselves these simple questions: If not us, then who? If not now, when? "Friends - we are Scotland's independence generation - and our time is now." Mr Salmond said of a "yes" vote in the referendum: "It will be, above all, an act of national self confidence and national self belief. "We, the people of Scotland, have by far the greatest stake in its success." Mr Salmond said the devolved Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, had been used to enact policies, like the public smoking ban, free personal care for the elderly and a council tax freeze. He went on: "With just a taste of independence, we've been able to deliver fairer policies than elsewhere in these islands. "With a measure of independence on health, on education, on law and order we've sought to make Scotland a better place. "So, let's consider what we can achieve by extending our power over the things we don't currently control. "Our welfare system, our economy, our energy supplies, our international security. "Because there is no doubt that we are paying a heavy price for Westminster decisions." The first minister said Scotland had to move away from Westminster government decisions, which he said people north of the border did not want, from housing benefit welfare reforms - branded the welfare tax by critics - to Trident nuclear weapons on the Clyde. Mr Salmond said the national minimum wage, which was brought in by the UK Labour government and which benefits about 70,000 people in Scotland, had failed to increase in real terms in almost 10 years. The first minister said a fair work commission, established under independence by an SNP government, would be to set a minimum wage guarantee. He said: "This guarantee will ensure that the minimum wage rises at the very least in line with inflation. "Let us pledge that never gain will the wages of the lowest paid in Scotland fail to keep up with the cost of living." At the same time, Mr Salmond again challenged David Cameron to face him in a referendum TV debate - an invitation the Prime Minister declined after arguing the event should be between the leaders of the campaigns for and against independence. The SNP leader said: "Here's the deal prime minister - we'll publish the white paper then you and I must debate, prime minister to first minister. "The choice is yours - step up to the plate or step out of the debate." Turning to the Grangemouth dispute, Mr Salmond said it was time for an injection of "common sense" into the bitter row between its operator Ineos and the Unite union. Ineos says the site is losing £10m a month and will close by 2017 unless workers agree to a rescue package which includes a change in their terms and conditions and final salary pension scheme. Mr Salmond left the conference on Thursday to facilitate talks between the two sides, but no agreement has been reached, and the petrochemical plant remains closed. The first minister said the threat to Grangemouth grew the longer it was shut, saying: "To the union - drop any strike threat. To the management - fire up the plant and then negotiate against the background of a working facility, not one which is in mortal danger. Find common ground. "Let us be quite clear - Scotland wants to see Grangemouth operating and the people of Grangemouth working - fire up the plant and do it now." </body>

      <title>HS2 will benefit UK, says minister</title>
      <description>Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin says the HS2 project will benefit the whole UK, after figures suggested some areas would be worse off if it was built.</description>

      <body>The HS2 high-speed rail project will bring benefits to the whole UK, the transport secretary has said. Patrick McLoughlin was speaking after details of the potential losses that HS2 could cause in about 50 regional economies as calculated by consultants KPMG were revealed by BBC Newsnight. Some of the "losing" areas would benefit from other planned rail improvements, Mr McLoughlin said. He said the project "was controversial, but it was the right thing to do". Speaking to the BBC, Mr McLoughlin said he wanted to see every part of the UK benefit from HS2. "All these investments that we are looking at is to serve the people of the UK, to make the UK a place where we attract investment," he said. "It's of no doubt to me that it's beneficial to the UK. We need to make sure our cities in the north are able to compete with the rest of Europe as well. "HS2 is vitally important overall for the long-term future of the economy." The KPMG report, which was released in September, said the line could boost the UK economy by £15bn a year and listed the regions it said would benefit, with Greater London and West Midlands the biggest winners. But although it included maps showing which areas not on the route could potentially be worse off, it did not include details of the scale of possible losses. KPMG's findings have now been released in a freedom of information request passed to BBC Two's Newsnight programme. According to the research economic output would be worst affected: HS2 Ltd's chief executive has called them "unsurprising". But James Bream, policy director of Aberdeen's Chamber of Commerce, said it was "really disappointing" that such a huge number was left out of the original report. He added the negative impact for the whole north-east of Scotland could be "significant to say the least." Richard Houghton, from campaign group HS2 Action Alliance, claimed the whole project is based on "voodoo economics". He said: "If I was sitting in one of the 50 areas set to lose out to the tune of millions of pounds, I would be asking very clear questions." The chief executive of HS2 Ltd, Alison Munro, said: "What this is showing is that the places that are on the high-speed network... those are the places that will benefit most from high-speed two. "But high-speed two isn't the only investment that the government is making. Over the next five years it is planning to spend £73bn on transport infrastructure." </body>

      <title>RBS decision imminent, says Osborne</title>
      <description>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he tells the Daily Telegraph.</description>

      <body>George Osborne expects to make a decision about how to break up the state-controlled Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) in "the next two or three weeks", he has told the Daily Telegraph. He said the government - which owns 81% of RBS - was considering hiving off weaker parts into a "bad bank". The decision was "top of his in-tray", the chancellor told the Telegraph. Meanwhile, chief executive Ross McEwan has told staff not to be distracted by speculation on the bank's future. RBS was bailed out for £45bn in 2008 at the height of the financial crisis. "We are looking at the case for a bad bank and, if not a bad bank, what is the alternative strategy that really gets on top of the problems in that bank and goes on being what I want it to be which is a bank supporting the British economy," Mr Osborne said. He added that he was considering offering shares to the public in Lloyds, the other major bank in which the state holds a substantial stake. "We are now looking actively at a retail offer for the next tranche of Lloyds shares," he said. But he said the government was not, "at the moment, close to the stage of being able to sell RBS shares". He added: "RBS was a much more complex bank. "To be fair to management past and present, it was a bank that was in a lot more trouble." He said "the clean-up job" had been "more difficult but we have got to make these decisions now about the future for RBS". Investment bank Rothschild has been advising the government on whether the bank's bad loans should be hived off into a separate entity. But in a memo to staff, Ross McEwan - who took over as RBS chief executive at the start of this month - said a bad bank would only affect a small proportion of RBS's overall business. Analysts have said that the vast bulk of RBS's assets are likely to be unaffected by the review. "The truth is, the review and its outcomes are important, but not in the way many people think," Mr McEwan said. "The future of this company will not be about whether we operate in particular areas or where our problem assets sit. The future of this company is about how good a job we do for our customers, including those who are having difficulty repaying their loans. "But the debate you read about in the papers - and that has taken up too much time of the management team - has been about what is now a small proportion of our activity." He said the bank was "taking responsibility for resolving these debates", "Let's address the legitimate concerns shareholders and other stakeholders have," he added. "And then let's get on with building a great bank for customers." Mr McEwan replaced Stephen Hester, who spent four years trying to repair the bank's balance sheet. </body>

      <body>The Aberdeen North Labour MP Frank Doran is to stand down at the next general election in 2015. He has represented the people of the north east city at Westminster since 1987. Mr Doran told the party he believed it was now time to step aside and give someone else the chance to fight for the seat. The 64-year-old said it had been an "enormous privilege to represent the city in parliament". Mr Doran was elected MP for Aberdeen South in 1987 and subsequently for Aberdeen Central in 1997. Following boundary changes in 2005, he was then elected to represent Aberdeen North. The MP said: "By the next election I will have been an MP for 23 years I think it is time to step aside to give someone else the chance from the Labour Party the opportunity to represent Aberdeen in Westminster." Mr Doran was shadow minister for energy between 1988 and 1992, he has sat on the culture, media and sport select committee and has campaigned for improved safety in the North Sea. </body>

      <title>Drop siege mentality, says Robinson</title>
      <description>First Minister Peter Robinson has challenged unionists to drop their "siege mentality" during a speech to Castlereagh council.</description>

      <body>First Minister Peter Robinson has challenged unionists to drop their "siege mentality". He said they should move forward with nationalists to overcome the problems facing Northern Ireland. "Unionism has historically had a siege mentality," he said. "When we were being besieged it was the right response. But when we are in a constitutionally safe and stable position it poses a threat to our future development." Mr Robinson made his remarks in a speech to Castlereagh council on Friday. It came less than 24 hours after he acknowledged the efforts of the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA) to build better community relations in a symbolic address at Queen's University in Belfast. "Unionists and nationalists will face some big decisions in the next few months," added Mr Robinson. "We can get back on track to a shared and united community which can benefit everyone in Northern Ireland or we can go back to the 40-year conflict. There is no middle option." Reflecting on a troubled last 12 months, when disputes over flags, parades and commemorations erupted into street disorder and damaged community relations, the DUP leader said there was a need for more strategic thinking within unionism. He urged the unionist community not to let recent difficulties throw them off course from the ultimate objective of forging a "shared and united" society. Mr Robinson said there was no prospect of the assembly falling, but nevertheless warned that such a development would likely lead to an upsurge in paramilitary violence. Former US diplomat Dr Richard Haass is currently chairing talks in a bid to find solutions on the contentious issues of flags, parades and dealing with the past. While Mr Robinson's address included criticism of, and challenges to, nationalism and republicanism, its intended audience was unionism. He said the Union was stronger than ever, and cautioned unionists not to "turn the clock back to a bygone era" and urged them to have more self confidence. He said unionism should not be defined simply by the issues of "flags and parades" but by what he described as the benefits of living in the UK. "Unionism needs to think and act strategically," he said. "Adopting political strategies that will inevitably lead down a cul de sac is not politically courageous, it is politically crazy. Because if unionists are not seen to make Northern Ireland work within the Union then no one will. "Unionism will only succeed if it is a broad coalition of interests. I accept that not every person who wishes to remain part of the United Kingdom will share my affection for the national flag or even my cultural heritage. "My responsibility as leader of the largest unionist party is to seek to hold that broad coalition together for it is only the capacity to bring together those with differing views under a common banner that gives unionism its strength." The speech marked the installation of David Drysdale as mayor of Castlereagh. </body>

      <title>Welby urges energy firm 'generosity'</title>
      <description>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit.</description>

      <body>The Archbishop of Canterbury has entered the debate about energy prices by urging firms to act with generosity, rather than just maximising profit. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, the Most Reverend Justin Welby said he understood people who found the latest price hikes "inexplicable". The former oil executive said companies had to "justify fully" their actions. Last week, British Gas followed SSE's rises with a 9.2% increase in its dual-fuel bill price. The archbishop told the Mail on Sunday: "The impact on people, particularly on low incomes, is going to be really severe in this. "I do understand when people feel that this is inexplicable, and I can understand people being angry about it, because having spent years on a low income as a clergyman I know what it is like when your household budget is blown apart by a significant extra fuel bill and your anxiety levels become very high." Amid predictions that the four other major energy suppliers - EDF, E.On, npower, Scottish Power - will now also raise their prices, Archbishop Welby urged firms to be "conscious of their social obligations". He added they had to to "behave with generosity and not merely to maximise opportunity". "They have control because they sell something everyone has to buy. We have no choice about buying it," he said. "With that amount of power comes huge responsibility to serve society. "It is not like some other sectors of business where people can walk away from you if they don't want to buy your product and you are entitled to seek to maximise your profit. "The social licence to operate of the energy companies is something they have to take very, very seriously indeed." The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, previously suggested the City of London has been affected by a "culture of entitlement" at variance with what others think reasonable and hit out at payday lenders charging high interest rates. He said he was concerned that fuel poverty was "a very severe issue... because real incomes are flat or declining and the cost of energy has gone up". "It ties in with the food banks and the debt," he said. "They are all part of the reality of life for many people today." The rise in energy costs has sparked a huge political debate with Labour leader Ed Miliband pledging a price freeze for 20 months if his party wins the next election. Prime Minister David Cameron has said he was "disappointed" by the rises but described Mr Miliband's plan as a "con", saying that he did not have control over the worldwide price of gas. He has said consumers should look to switch suppliers to keep bills down. </body>

      <title>PM backs 'illegal immigrant' texts</title>
      <description>David Cameron backs the 'principle' of sending warning text messages to suspected illegal immigrants - even though some have gone to the wrong people.</description>

      <body>David Cameron "agrees with the principle" of sending text messages suggesting the recipients are illegal immigrants, despite some going to the wrong people, his spokesman has said. The Home Office says just 14 people out of a total of 58,800 contacted were mistakenly asked if they had overstayed their visas. But campaigners say the true number of people wrongly contacted is far higher. Labour described the government's tactic as "shambolic and incompetent". Some people suspected of having outstayed their visas were sent a text reading: "Our records show you may not have leave to remain in the UK. Please contact us to discuss your case." The prime minister's official spokesman acknowledged that the wording of the texts had changed since the campaign began. Originally, they had included the phrase: "You are required to leave the UK as you no longer have the right to remain." The Home Office said it was "right to enforce the rules", and Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "The prime minister agrees with the principle of the texts. "It is one of various means the Home Office contacts people who may not have the right to remain in the UK." But two recipients of the texts - campaigner Suresh Grover and immigration lawyer Bobby Chan - reacted angrily to the message. "I came here with my parents in 1966, I was born in East Africa and have a British passport," Mr Grover told the Independent newspaper - adding he was "shocked" and "horrified" to be contacted in this way. Mr Chan said the texts "stereotype immigrants as a criminal community and create an atmosphere of fear". But the Home Office defended its position: "We are taking proactive steps to contact individuals who records show have no valid right to be in the UK." The individuals affected had been contacted in a variety of ways, including email and text, it added. It also denied that Mr Grover had been contacted at all. Mr Grover told the BBC he would instruct his lawyers to write to the Home Office, challenging its claim he had not received the text directly. The department has received more than 140 complaints about the campaign, although Capita said: "Most complaints occurred in the early part of the contract where Capita was, as part of the contract, updating sometimes out-of-date Home Office records." Capita believes that 4,160 people have departed the UK since December 2012 as a result as a result of being contacted, the Home Office said. Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said: "Theresa May's immigration system lurches from one gimmick to another with little effect. "The reports that the government has allowed a private contractor to send British citizens text message telling them to leave the country demonstrates once more just how shambolic and incompetent the Home Office's border police is under Theresa May. "These messages will rightly cause distress and offence to British citizens, many of whom have done much to contribute to our society. It is simply wrong for this sort of message to be sent by text, and to be so poorly targeted." UKIP leader Nigel Farage, who campaigns for tighter border controls and Britain's exit from the EU, said the text message scheme was the product of a government with "absolutely zero sensibility and even less sense". "To send threatening text messages and emails to people on some sort of clearly ill-managed central database is deeply disturbing and the sort of behaviour one would expect from a fascistic police state, not a democratic and inclusive nation. Quite frankly it's abhorrent." UKIP MEP candidate Amjad Bashir said: "I find it utterly repugnant that people like me, who may have been born abroad but who are passport-holding and hard-working citizens of the UK are being threatened by the government in this way." Meanwhile, immigration minister Mark Harper has said that vans telling illegal immigrants in London to "go home or face arrest" could be deployed across the UK. He told BBC One's Question Time that the government was assessing the results of the scheme, which was piloted in the capital earlier this year. During July, they were driven around the London boroughs of Barking and Dagenham, Redbridge, Barnet, Brent, Ealing and Hounslow for a week. Labour accused ministers of "borrowing the language" used by the National Front in the 1970s. Lib Dem Business Secretary Vince Cable said the campaign had been "stupid and offensive". Earlier this month, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) banned the posters, saying they had misled the public about the arrest statistics displayed. However, it cleared the campaign of being offensive and irresponsible. Mr Harper told Question Time: "I don't have any problem with saying to people who are here illegally that they shouldn't be here anymore." </body>

      <title>Portillo 'misspeaks' on pleb claims</title>

      <body>Michael Portillo has said he "misspoke" when he claimed he had heard former Conservative chief whip Andrew Mitchell say the word "pleb". Mr Mitchell resigned his post in 2012 after Downing Street police accused him of calling them plebs during a row - a word he denied having used. In a live discussion on the BBC's This Week, Mr Portillo revealed: "I have heard him use that word in private conversation - the pleb word, I mean." But he now says he got "carried away". Pressed on the This Week programme on Thursday about whether he had heard Mr Mitchell use the word, Mr Portillo said: "I think I did, but not in a bad context. "Some policeman thought: 'Ah, that's a word that people will believe that Andrew Mitchell might have used.' "But he wouldn't have used it in that context." On Friday, the former Conservative cabinet minister added: "I seem to have misspoken. I had no right to say that. "I think I got carried away in the heat of the moment. I did not mean to say it and I want to withdraw it." The former politician, who served as defence secretary under John Major, is a regular pundit on the show. Mr Mitchell admitted swearing during the September 2012 row with police officers who said he could not ride his bicycle through the main Downing Street gate. But he also maintained: "I think most people who know me know I would not use words like pleb or moron in describing anyone." The Conservative MP has claimed that the officers involved conspired against him in a bid to "toxify" his party. After a meeting with Mr Mitchell at his Sutton Coldfield constituency office in October 2012, three local representatives of the Police Federation criticised the MP for casting doubt on the Downing Street officers' version of events, said he had refused to disclose the exact words he had used in the row, and had "no option but to resign". Mr Mitchell says he has a transcript contradicting their account of the meeting. The chiefs of West Mercia, West Midlands and Warwickshire police forces concluded that no disciplinary action was needed against their officers, even though an internal investigation by West Mercia Police had initially said there was a "case to answer for misconduct". The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has said the officers who spoke to Mr Mitchell should have faced misconduct hearings, and Prime Minister David Cameron has said the MP is "owed an apology". Eight people have been arrested and bailed under Scotland Yard's investigation into the affair, including five police officers. The Crown Prosecution Service is considering whether to bring criminal charges against any of them. </body>

      <title>SNP pledges energy bill cut post Yes</title>
      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister Nicola Sturgeon unveils plans to cut energy bills by 5% a year in an independent Scotland.</description>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister has unveiled plans to cut energy bills by about 5% a year if the country votes for independence. Nicola Sturgeon told the SNP's conference in Perth the reduction of about £70 would be achieved by removing a number of "green" charges. She believed the measure would not be a short-term fix, but a "real and lasting cut". People in Scotland vote in an independence referendum next year. On Thursday, 18 September, 2014, they will be asked the straight "yes/no" question: "Should Scotland be an independent country?" Ms Sturgeon explained that two schemes worth up to half of the green costs imposed on energy companies would be removed from the bills of consumers. The minister told the party's annual gathering: "Right now, the Scottish government invests around £80m a year on energy efficiency schemes to help meet our climate change targets and lower the costs of energy bills. "A further £120m comes from a scheme designed in Westminster, operated through energy companies and paid for by a levy on your gas and electricity bills. "It is a disjointed approach, it doesn't take account of Scottish priorities and it's not as efficient as it could be." Ms Sturgeon went on to announce that an SNP government in an independent Scotland would remove the energy saving measures and the warm home discount from energy bills. She said the current system would be replaced by a more joined-up approach with funding for fuel poverty schemes - worth up to £200m per year - coming directly from government. Ms Sturgeon added: "Independence will allow us to tackle fuel poverty much more directly, delivering Scottish solutions to Scottish problems, and ensuring that energy companies always behave in a socially responsible way to protect vulnerable customers." She insisted the energy schemes would be delivered more effectively and it would save hard-pressed consumers money. The SNP deputy leader told the conference: "We estimate that it will cut energy bills by around 5% - or £70 a year. "Not a short-term measure - but a real and lasting cut in Scottish energy bills." The minister went on to demand that the coalition government at Westminster ditch its spare room subsidy, which is described by critics as the ''bedroom tax''. But she said if it refused to act, the current Scottish government would allocate "up to £20m" for a second year to help those who have been affected. Ms Sturgeon also announced that the Holyrood administration would fund the Poverty Alliance to deliver a Living Wage Accreditation Scheme to "promote the living wage and increase the number of private companies that pay it". Turning to the issue of health, Ms Sturgeon said a UK-wide approach "would be the worst thing that could ever happen to the Scottish NHS". She added: "Westminster privatisation of the NHS is not wanted in Scotland. "Scotland's national health service is staying in public hands." Ms Sturgeon went on to warn that Westminster MPs in all the UK parties were "itching to abolish the Barnett formula and cut Scotland's share of spending". She said: "So, I say this to everyone yet to make up their mind [on independence]. Consider carefully the arguments for a Yes vote. Subject them to scrutiny and ask the tough questions. "But do not ever let anyone pull the wool over your eyes about the consequences of a No vote. "They are clear and they are real. Scotland's social security system will be dismantled; Scotland's public services and universal benefits will be under threat and Scotland's budget will be cut. "The risks of a No vote are real." Ms Sturgeon promised that the Scottish government's White Paper on independence, which is due to be published next month, would "answer all your questions". She added: "The White Paper will be Scotland's detailed guide to independence. "It will make the positive case. It will explain the process by which we will become independent and describe how our newly independent country will work. "It will set out the gains of independence for you, your family and for your community." Towards the end of her speech, Ms Sturgeon said: "The vote in 2014 is not a vote for or against the SNP. "It is a vote for or against the power to take decisions in Scotland." She insisted that an SNP government after independence would bring the mail service back into public ownership; reverse welfare reforms; protect state pensions and get rid of Trident nuclear weapons. </body>

      <title>East Coast rail 'sales pitch leaked'</title>
      <description>The RMT says it has obtained leaked documents that show the government is playing down the success of a publicly-owned rail line in its pitch to would-be investors.</description>

      <body>A rail union claims to have obtained a leaked copy of a prospectus for the privatisation of the East Coast Main Line. The RMT says the document shows the government is playing down the success of the line under public ownership to "bulldoze" the sale of it through. The East Coast line was taken back into public hands in 2009 when National Express handed back the franchise. The government said the RMT was "scaremongering". But the RMT says the leaked prospectus showed the government was engaged in a "systematic and politically motivated devaluation of the performance" of the line, which is due to return to private hands in 2015. The document appears to be a draft version of the final sale brochure for potential investors, with handwritten notes and revisions in the margin. It is intended for "investment professionals only" and not for wider circulation, the text warns. The union claims a paragraph noting the line "three percentage points ahead of the long-distance train operator average" in the 2012 National Passenger Survey had been deleted. A comment on the document also referred to avoiding "references to competitors", the union claimed. "The crucial commentary that East Coast is not only ahead of Virgin and First Great Western - the other inter-city franchise holders - but that East Coast under public ownership is also amongst the highest performers in Europe for passengers per mile had been redacted," the union added. RMT general secretary Bob Crow said: "This leaked document, coming on the day of union protests at Parliament aimed at keeping the East Coast in public ownership, is political dynamite which blows the lid off the lengths to which the government are prepared to go to bulldoze through reprivatisation before the next election. "The fact that the public option is putting over £1bn back into the Treasury, while improving services and delivering more capacity, has been cynically airbrushed out of the final document in a disgraceful piece of political chicanery which must be called in for scrutiny to hold back this full-tilt dash for privatisation." The union also said the document redacts sections highlighting the good punctuality and performance of the service under public ownership. But a Department for Transport spokesman said: "This is ill informed scaremongering from the RMT. "By choosing to release inaccurate information, they are misleading the public. We have no intention of requiring a 'third class' service, reducing performance levels, or in any way devaluing this vital railway. "As the independent Brown Review concluded, franchising works for passengers and taxpayers alike. " Labour says services can be run just as well under public ownership. Shadow transport secretary Mary Creagh said: "East Coast is working well and will have returned £800m to the taxpayer by the end of this financial year. "This government has learned nothing from the West Coast franchising fiasco, which saw over £50m of taxpayers' money wasted in compensation to train companies, through ministers' incompetence." </body>

      <title>Lib Dems 'veer left like a trolley'</title>
      <description>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, recently sacked as a Home Office minister, compares his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left".</description>

      <body>Lib Dem MP Jeremy Browne, who was sacked as a Home Office minister in a recent reshuffle, has compared his party to a faulty shopping trolley that "defaults to the left". In an interview with the Times, he said he had spent years trying to exert "corrective pressure" on the Lib Dems to make them a "party of government". Now they were in danger of becoming a "party of protest" again, he warned. "We must avoid facing inwards," he told the newspaper. Mr Browne had been regarded as one of Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg's closest allies before the reshuffle and a rising star within the party. He was replaced at the Home Office by fellow Lib Dem MP Norman Baker, seen as being on the left of the party. Mr Browne described his sacking as "puzzling" and "a bit painful". "I saw my role, and continue to do so, as doing everything I can to accelerate the Lib Dems' journey from a party of protest to a party of government," he said. The MP for Taunton Deane, in Somerset, continued: "If the Lib Dems look ambivalent about being in government we can hardly then complain if people assume that its successes must be down to the party that doesn't look ambivalent. "You can't be half in and half out of government. We have to avoid the trap of looking like a party that is a reluctant party of government and looking uncomfortable and that we'd be grateful to be relieved of our collective responsibilities. "There is a role in politics for stopping things you don't want to happen, but I want the greatest emphasis to be on what we have managed to achieve rather than what we have managed to prevent the Conservatives from achieving." Mr Browne was appointed a Foreign Office minister when the Lib Dem/Tory coalition government was formed in 2010 and was moved to the Home Office in 2012. At the Lib Dem conference in September, he accused the Liberal Democrats of being "uncomfortable" with wealth creation and always wanting "to demonstrate our disapproval of people becoming wealthy and successful and creating jobs in our economy". He also called for a debate on whether Muslim girls should be banned from wearing full-face veils in some public places. He ruled out defecting to the Conservative Party in his Times interview, saying he had turned down the offer of a meeting with Tory chairman Grant Shapps. He told the newspaper he planned to fight the next election as a Liberal Democrat. "I had no intention or desire to defect to the Conservatives," he added. </body>

      <title>Corroboration 'must go' for justice</title>
      <description>Scotland's justice secretary voices his determination to get rid of the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources, despite opposition.</description>

      <body>Scotland's justice secretary has voiced his determination to get rid of the need for evidence in criminal trials to come from two sources. Kenny MacAskill told the SNP conference dropping the centuries-old requirement for corroboration meant people would no longer have to suffer in silence. Sections of the legal profession oppose the move and the SNP's Christine Grahame has urged caution. But Mr MacAskill said criminal law had to be brought into the 21st Century. Proposals to drop the general requirement for corroboration are part of a series of justice reforms which have been put forward by the Scottish government. Supporters say the plan could improve conviction rates in areas such as sex crime and domestic abuse cases. But opponents argue corroboration provides an important safeguard against miscarriages of justice. Addressing delegates in Perth, Mr MacAskill said: "We need to address the historic anomaly of the routine requirement for corroboration. "Those who suffer rape and other serious sexual assault are denied justice by it. "But it's not just the victims of these horrendous sexual crimes, but many others, whether children or the elderly - crimes committed without eyewitnesses." The justice secretary went on: "Of the latest shameful statistics on domestic abuse, 10% of crimes reported to the Crown couldn't be prosecuted because of the lack of corroboration. "And those were only the ones the police reported - many others didn't even make it to the fiscal's office as they knew the Crown couldn't pursue them." Mr MacAskill said the abolition of corroboration would come hand-in-hand with additional safeguards including a "qualitative and quantitive" test for prosecutions and increasing the majority required by juries for a conviction. He said: "Justice there must be and corroboration must go." Ms Grahame, convener of the Scottish Parliament's cross-party justice committee, which is scrutinising the government's proposals, has warned any changes must be for the benefit of the complainer and accused, not because they are "politically popular". </body>

      <title>Anger as diabetic children miss out</title>
      <description>Some health boards are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales finds.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24593744</url>

      <body>Some health boards in Wales are not following mandatory guidelines by failing to provide insulin pumps to children with type 1 diabetes, BBC Wales has found. Pumps change the lives of diabetics by removing the need for daily injections and must be provided if needed. But BBC Wales has found there are 29 young patients in Wales waiting for insulin pump therapy. The Welsh government said it expected health boards to follow the guidelines. BBC Radio Wales current affairs programme Eye On Wales spoke to the Children's Commissioner for Wales who said it could be a breach of the children's human rights. There are two kinds of diabetes. Type 2 accounts for 90% of cases - and 10% of NHS spending - and is linked to lifestyle, obesity and age. Type 1 diabetes has no link to lifestyle choices and occurs when the pancreas fails to produce the insulin the body needs to process glucose. It is managed by measuring the sugar in the bloodstream and then giving the body the insulin it needs to survive. There are approximately 16,000 people with type 1 diabetes in Wales and 1,400 of them are children and young people. Nine-year-old Emily Agutter, from Usk in Monmouthshire, has to test her blood sugar levels and inject herself with insulin several times a day after being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes over a year ago. She does not like the injections and would like to try an insulin pump but her health board has told her family she cannot have one yet. Emily has been waiting for 10 months despite the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines which say one should be provided. Her father, Neil Agutter, who also has type 1 diabetes, has an insulin pump. "It makes me incredibly angry - it's there in black and white," Mr Agutter said. "We have asked and there are funding issues in terms of resources for the hospital. "The hospital doctors and nurses who treat Emily are lovely and they do a great job. We've just been told they can't do it yet, there's too many people waiting. And when somebody's nine years old, it's a long time for somebody so young." Emily is not the only child with type 1 diabetes waiting for an insulin pump in Wales. Eye on Wales has learned that three health boards have children on a waiting list - Emily's own board, Aneurin Bevan, has 15 youngsters waiting while Cardiff and Vale has 11 and Hywel Dda, three. "If you're on a waiting list then I think you could take a pretty clear view that that's a breach of that child's rights," said the Children's Commissioner for Wales Keith Towler. "Now if the child wants the pump and the family are happy for the child to have the pump, then actually sort out the resource issues later if you have to, but actually just make that pump available. "This is a life-changing diagnosis for a child and that child needs as much support as they can possibly get. Let's take it right back to the child and make sure that the child gets that service." Aneurin Bevan Health Board said while it could not comment on individual cases it was committed to increasing access to insulin pump therapy as a treatment option. The board said it planned to increase the number of children on the therapy from 33 to 90 over the next two years. Health Minister Mark Drakeford said: "I'm afraid just in the practical world, it won't always be the case that the minute someone has been assessed for an insulin pump that that pump will immediately be available..." He said staff were also required to make sure the pump was "successfully used". "So I would expect anybody who has been assessed that every effort is made at local health board level to make the period of time they have to wait between being assessed for suitability and getting the pump to be short as possible," he said. "I certainly expect the health boards will follow mandatory NICE guidance, that they have to find ways within their very stretched budgets to be able to do that." He said the Welsh NHS spent £500m a year on diabetes, and health boards had to prioritise and put the money where it was most needed. Eye on Wales is on BBC Radio Wales on Sunday, 20 October at 12:00 BST. </body>

      <title>Loan companies 'preying on the poor'</title>
      <description>A new study calls for action after finding payday and doorstep lenders were "preying on the poor".</description>

      <body>Eleanor Eamens started off borrowing £100 from a doorstep lender to help with the cost of Christmas. Soon she ended up with six separate loans, owing the lender £4,000. The mum from Belford in Northumberland found the £50-a-week payments impossible on her income, forcing her to choose between servicing the debt and feeding her five children. But even towards the end when she was missing payments, the company continued to offer her loans. She said: "I take responsibility for what I did. Nobody forced me to borrow the money, but when you are on a small income it's so tempting. "They did not ever look if I had other debts or whether I could afford it on my income. They simply didn't have a clue." And a new study carried out in the North East has found that Eleanor Eamens' experience was all too common of low income households. Durham University worked with 24 families in Middlesbrough and Stockton. Many didn't have a bank account, and the ones that did were only allowed basic services with no access to an overdraft or credit card. The most any of the families had in savings was £4, yet their debts ranged from £340 to £10,000. Many had multiple loans with payday and doorstep lenders, at annual interest rates of up to 4,000% even though their incomes were small. Professor Sarah Banks, who led the study, says this had a profound and negative impact on their lives. She said: "It was quick and convenient to get the loans, but very soon people were finding themselves saddled with large debts. "Many were desperate, some had moved home, others had gone off incognito to try and get away from the debt and many had mental health problems which were quite severe." The researchers believe these families were preyed upon by lenders even though they clearly couldn't afford the debt. Professor Banks believes there needs to be a cap on the amount loaned to individuals and greater checks on their ability to pay. She said: "The companies were purely interested in getting more customers and not in whether people could pay it back. They charge huge rates and built into those rates is the assumption that they will default. "We want all these high cost credit companies to carry out affordability checks. If people can't afford them they shouldn't really be offered the loans." And the pressure does seem to be ramping up on high cost credit companies. The government is planning tighter regulation of the industry from next April, but Labour has gone a step further by backing some form of cap, and promising a levy on the firms. That money will then be used to help develop community credit unions to provide low cost alternatives. But some believe the idea is unworkable. Phil Hall from the ifs University College, which specialises in financial education, says credit unions will never be a substitute because they require people to save before they can lend He also believes the high cost credit industry is already well-supervised. He said: "The fixation with huge APR rates for payday lenders is very misleading because APRs are annual, payday loans are not. Often it is cheaper to borrow from a payday lender than to dip into an unauthorised overdraft or to take out a lengthy bank loan but these basic facts appears to be lost on policymakers. "The government should be cracking down on illegal lending and loan sharks rather than directing misguided attention to what is already a well regulated market." And those who work in the industry believe they provide a vital service. Julio Martino runs a local payday loan shop in Newcastle. He says he does check people's ability to pay and charges realistic interest rates. He said: "I think it is important businesses do not charge ridiculous interest rates but we do have to charge a rate that allows us to make money. We are not a bank, or building society or a huge financial organisation so we cannot charge APRs similar to credit cards. "We are essentially lending to people who cannot get credit from banks, and companies like mine are willing to take a slightly greater risk to lend to these people who do need credit." But the researchers at Durham University believe people can be given help to avoid unmanageable debt. They worked with community organisation Thrive Teesside to provide mentors for low income families to guide them. That helped many, and some now do use credit unions. Eleanor Eamens has also drawn a line under her loans. She'll be debt-free by January and has begun saving with her local credit union. She says she'll never go back to high cost credit. But with the high cost credit industry worth many hundreds of millions of pounds, will it ever be possible - or even desirable - to wean people off the payday and doorstep lender? </body>

      <title>VIDEO: Food scandal 'could happen again'</title>
      <description>With cuts to food inspection and reports of increasing fraud, can the public be confident the food we eat is what we think it is?</description>

      <body>With cuts to front line inspectors and reports of increasing food fraud, can the public be confident about food standards following the recent horse meat scandal? Food writer Jay Rayner investigates how well food producers and retailers have responded and visits Tesco's laboratories in Wolverhampton to see what the retailer is doing to improve testing. But the industry is vast and the system of keeping it under control is complex. A new report by the National Audit Office has found the public's expectations about the authenticity of food are not being matched by the effectiveness of controls in place. Andy Foster from the Trading Standards Institute says the inspection system is "creaking" and in his view "the horse meat scandal could happen again". The Food Standards Agency says the current financial environment is challenging but it has invested considerably more in the last year to boost efforts and resources to detect problems.

      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander has dismissed the idea of cutting VAT on energy bills. Conservative MP Robert Halfon had called for the 5% VAT rate on energy to be reduced or scrapped. Concerns about energy affordability have risen due to sharp rises in the cost of gas and electricity over recent years. British Gas has announced it is increasing prices for domestic customers in November, with a dual-fuel bill going up by 9.2%. </body>

      <body>This week at Westminster has been dominated by one topic: energy prices. It is a case study of the biggest theme in politics at the moment, the cost of living. With British Gas joining energy provider SSE in hiking its prices, what are people feeling the squeeze and fearing the cold supposed to do? Enter, stage left, the humble jumper. And welcome to a brief snapshot of how headlines sometimes appear despite what might have emerged out of the lips of politicians and their advisers. Energy Secretary Ed Davey spent much of Thursday touring TV and radio studios criticising British Gas and suggesting people should shop around for the best energy deal. In an interview on the BBC's Newsnight, he was asked about what happened in the Davey household. Did Mr Davey, presenter Jeremy Paxman asked, wear a jumper? "I am sure people do wear jumpers, I wear jumpers at home, but you are missing the point here Jeremy, we do need to help people with their bills, I am extremely worried about them, we can use competition the way we have, we can make our homes warmer and use less electricity and gas by going more energy efficient," said Mr Davey. Cue headlines suggesting the energy secretary said wear a jumper. Great story. Except he didn't say this. Mr Davey was asked about jumpers. Mr Davey mentioned jumpers. But Mr Davey didn't say you or I should wear a jumper. Fast forward 12 hours to Friday's briefing for Westminster journalists, which is conducted by one of the prime minister's official spokesmen. The Daily Mirror - which is no fan of the coalition government - chased this theme with some vigour. The clear aim of the questions was to attempt to get an answer along the lines of "the prime minister tells you to wear jumper". If he'd said that, I'd have been jumping at the chance to get on the television, radio and online to tell it. But he didn't. Here is the exchange, as I scribbled it in my notebook: Reporter: "Does the prime minister wear a jumper at home?" Official Spokesman: "The prime minister doesn't tend to give fashion tips." Several further questions along the same lines came along, which didn't get very far. The spokesman was then asked about what the PM thought of charities giving advice that perhaps people should consider wrapping up warm. Here was the response: "Clearly, he is not going to prescribe necessarily the actions individuals should take about that. But if people are giving that advice, that is something that people may wish to consider." Next came the headlines claiming the prime minister was suggesting people should wear a jumper. Great story. Except the spokesman did not say this. Labour leapt at the chance to have their say, claiming Downing Street was in chaos and offering Ed Miliband for interview. Downing Street then issued a statement: "To be clear, it is entirely false to suggest the Prime Minister would advise people they should wear jumpers to stay warm. Any suggestion to the contrary is mischief-making." And so concludes the story of a story which isn't really a story at all. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Migrants and asylum in the EU</title>
      <description>What are the pressures on Europe from non-EU migrants fleeing war and poverty?</description>

      <body>The arrival of boatloads of poor and desperate migrants in Europe has put pressure on the EU to find a solution. Hundreds of non-EU migrants have drowned off the tiny Italian island of Lampedusa this month, after fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. How big is the migration challenge affecting Europe now? There is no doubt that the Arab Spring has put new migration pressures on Europe, swelling the numbers of people prepared to risk their lives by crossing the Mediterranean in rickety, overcrowded boats. In 2011 the big challenge was thousands of Tunisians arriving on Lampedusa. Later it was thousands of sub-Saharan Africans fleeing the conflict in Libya. Now it is the wave of Syrians fleeing the vicious civil war in their country. Italy and Malta have appealed for more help from the EU - not for the first time. Before this summer the focus was more on Greece, because its land border with Turkey had become the biggest crossing point for illegal migrants entering the EU. The Italian government says 35,085 migrants came ashore in Italy in January-October this year, of whom 73% met the legal criteria for asylum. Lampedusa is a migrant bottleneck because it is tiny and lies closer to North Africa than to Italy itself. Italy is expanding its reception centres to a 16,000 capacity, from the current 3,000. It had closed temporary camps for migrants from war-torn Libya at the end of 2012, after the defeat of Libyan ruler Col Muammar Gaddafi. Italy's problems are shared by some of its Mediterranean neighbours. Reception centres in Greece and Malta are overcrowded and under-resourced. Both countries have been criticised by the UN refugee agency UNHCR and human rights groups, who accuse them of violating migrants' rights. There are plenty of other routes taken by irregular migrants to enter the EU and start a new life. Mainland Greece remains a major transit point - many migrants travel up through the Balkans, hoping to reach northern Europe. Many illegal migrants go undetected, so there is no overall figure for them. But in 2012 there were 344,928 detections of illegal stay in the EU, according to the EU border agency Frontex. It calls the trend "generally stable". How does the Mediterranean compare with other entry points? In 2012 the Eastern Mediterranean route - via Greece - accounted for the most detections of illegal border-crossing. There were 37,214 detections (51% of the total). But in August 2012 the numbers trying to get in that way began to fall after Greece, helped by Frontex police, beefed up security on its land border with Turkey. The figure for the Central Mediterranean route - via Italy - rose to 10,379 (14% of the total). Before the Arab Spring the Western Mediterranean route was a big challenge for Spain, as many migrant boats arrived off the Canary Islands, carrying poor sub-Saharan Africans. Since then Spain has tightened up border co-operation with Morocco and has erected fortifications around its North African enclaves - Ceuta and Melilla. In 2012 detections of illegal border-crossing totalled 6,397 on the route to Spain. People traffickers also smuggle migrants into the EU via Eastern Europe, often hiding in lorries. The numbers entering that way are smaller. Some are victims of sexual exploitation, often from the former Soviet Union. But Germany has also seen a surge in the numbers of Chechens fleeing Russia and claiming asylum. Where do most of the migrants come from? On the Central Mediterranean route this year the largest numbers have been Syrians and Eritreans, followed by Somalis. War is raging in Somalia and Syria, and Italian officials believe many of the migrants are genuine asylum seekers, fleeing persecution. In the case of Eritrea, it appears many are young men fleeing compulsory military service, which has been likened to slavery. Eritrea is blighted by political repression, human rights groups say. In 2012 the largest number of asylum applications in the EU came from Afghans - 28,010. The other major countries of origin were Russia (24,285), Syria (21,100), Pakistan (19,685), Serbia (19,060) and Somalia (14,270). It is important to remember that huge numbers of EU citizens move from one EU country to another freely. They are also described as "migrants", but they are fully protected by EU law, unless they are fugitive criminals. Their status is quite different from that of non-EU migrants. In some EU countries, including the UK, they have become an issue because of pressure on social services and competition for jobs. Most EU countries are in the Schengen zone, which has made it much easier to cross borders without having to show a passport or other papers. How is the EU reacting to the current migrant problem? For years the EU has been struggling to harmonise asylum policy. That is difficult with 28 member states, each with their own police force and judiciary. More detailed joint rules have been brought in with the Common European Asylum System - but rules are one thing, putting them into practice EU-wide is another challenge. The Dublin Regulation is a core principle for handling asylum claims in the EU. It says responsibility for examining the claim lies primarily with the member state which played the greatest part in the applicant's entry or residence in the EU. Often that is the first EU country that the migrant reached - but not always, as in many cases migrants want to be reunited with family members, for example in the UK or the Netherlands. There are tensions in the EU over the Dublin Regulation - Greece complained that it was inundated with applications, as so many migrants arrived in Greece first. Finland and Germany are among several countries that have stopped sending migrants back to Greece. The EU also has the Eurodac system - a common database of asylum seekers' fingerprints, which can be accessed under strict controls. Police use it to intercept false or multiple claims. The European Commission has urged EU governments to expand the Mediterranean surveillance operation "from Spain to Cyprus", to prevent more boat tragedies. Frontex has only a few aircraft and boats off Italy - the agency's entire annual budget is 86m euros (£73m; $118m). Italy is stepping up its maritime patrols and the EU has agreed to launch a data exchange system in December, called Eurosur, to detect illegal migrant boats faster. How do migrants get asylum status in the EU? They have to satisfy the authorities that they are fleeing persecution and would face harm or even death if sent back to their country of origin. International law provides that protection for genuine refugees. The ban on mass "push-backs" - also known as "non-refoulement" - is an EU principle. In some cases it has not been respected, however. Before the Libya uprising the Italian government of Silvio Berlusconi routinely prevented migrant boats coming ashore, without processing asylum seekers. Greece has been accused of similar actions in the past. Under EU rules, an asylum seeker has the right to food, first aid and shelter in a reception centre. They should get an individual assessment of their needs. They can apply for asylum after giving fingerprints and being interviewed by a trained case worker. They may be granted asylum by the authorities at "first instance". If unsuccessful they can appeal against the decision in court, and may win. Asylum seekers are supposed to be granted the right to a job within nine months of arrival. The European Commission - the EU's executive - says there is still too much variation in the way EU states handle asylum claims. For example, the recognition rate for Sudanese asylum seekers is 2% in Spain, but 68% in Italy, the Commission says. How many asylum applications are successful? In 2012 there were 335,365 asylum applications in the EU - a rise on 2011. Germany ranked first, handling a quarter of the total applications. Nearly three-quarters of first instance rulings were negative, so just over a quarter of the applications were successful. Of the successful ones, 52% got refugee status - granted for those who have fled persecution. The others got "subsidiary protection" - meaning they would not be sent back, as that would put them in danger. </body>

      <title>London Mayor Boris Johnson sparks Chinese interest</title>
      <description>Boris Johnson wins Chinese fans on six-day tour</description>

      <body>Boris Johnson rode a rental bicycle through crowds of admirers, travelled on the Beijing subway and made a speech which mentioned Harry Potter, Downton Abbey and James Bond. Along the way, the mayor of London managed to impress legions of young fans in China. Mr Johnson is wrapping up a six-day tour of China, which is happening at the same time as a trade mission headed by UK Chancellor George Osborne. Mr Johnson appears to be the more popular of the two politicians in China. The mayor's visit sparked thousands of comments on Weibo, China's version of Twitter. Few posted similar remarks about Mr Osborne, the mayor's Conservative Party rival. "[Mr Johnson] is a little bit special," says 19-year-old Song Yige, a second year law student at Peking University, who was in the audience to watch speeches by both men. "Politicians in China, they're like the chancellor. They're very calm and composed. But the mayor, he is very humorous. He is not distant like other politicians." Weibo users were slightly less reserved in their admiration of Mr Johnson. "I like your fluffy hair," one user wrote in English. "If you get bald someday in the future, will you put a wig? What colour will you like to choose?" "I simply want to know how to move to London without breaking any law? PS: I am poor!!! PPS: we all love you!! XOXO!" wrote another. The mayor's Beijing subway ride was particularly impressive, Ms Song says. "It's like some fresh air to China because we have never seen that before." Chinese leaders have been criticised in the past for their reluctance to use public transport, preferring instead to travel in chauffeur-driven cars. However, China's leaders are starting to use the same populist approaches as Boris Johnson, says Wang Zhanpeng, director of the British Studies Centre at the Beijing Foreign Studies University. "Chinese leaders weren't doing things like this as much in the past, but now there are some changes," Mr Wang says. "There are also more cases of leaders demonstrating their man-of-the-people approach and their personalities, although our leaders would do it more often on occasions like disaster relief." Sina, a top Chinese web portal, hosted a web page this week titled "Ask Boris Johnson", in which the mayor answered questions on his love of bicycling and expected upgrades to London's underground system. Most comments and questions asked Mr Johnson for his experience running a city like London, asking for tips on how he might improve vast Chinese cities like Beijing. "Our nation's officials, please learn from others," one Weibo user said. </body>

      <title>Is it a good idea to allow China a stake in UK nuclear?</title>
      <description>Is the UK getting too close to China with latest power deal?</description>

      <body>The UK is to allow Chinese companies to take a stake in British nuclear power plants. Is this a good idea? It is 57 years to the day since the Queen threw a lever to start electricity flowing from the world's first civil nuclear power plant, at Calder Hall, in Cumbria. If you had told any of the dignitaries present that day that Britain would one day surrender control of its nuclear industry to foreign powers, losing in the process the ability to build its own reactors, they would have thought you were mad. But we have long got used to the idea that Britain is no longer an industrial powerhouse. So why should we be concerned that China, a former Cold War enemy, has been given the go-ahead to invest in new nuclear plants? The economics are simple enough. The government believes it needs new nuclear power plants to keep the lights on. But it has ruled out public subsidies, so badly needs private investment. "We need to see investment not just from China but from Japan, the US, France and the City of London," said Energy Secretary Ed Davey, an architect of the deal between French energy giant EDF and China General Nuclear Power Group. The deal is initially confined to a 30% stake in a single new plant, at Hinckley Point, which will be built using French and Japanese technology. But it could lead to Chinese companies taking majority stakes in future projects, and will see Chinese technicians being trained by British nuclear scientists. It is being hailed by Chancellor George Osborne as a triumph of British diplomacy, potentially opening up China's rapidly expanding nuclear energy market to British companies and keeping energy bills down for British consumers. But not everyone is quite so ecstatic. "With continuing concerns about Chinese cyber-attacks on foreign governments' computer systems, should we really be inviting companies which many believe to be effectively arms of the Chinese government into our critical infrastructure at all?," writes Stuart Nathan, in trade magazine The Engineer, calling the deal "inexplicable". In a recent Financial Times blog, former Downing Street energy policy adviser Nick Butler summed up the concerns: "They will be inside the system, with access to the intricate architecture of the UK's National Grid and the processes through which electricity supply is controlled, as well as to the UK's nuclear technology." Lord West, cyber security minister in the previous Labour government, has been vocal about the threat posed by China to Britain's computer networks - something always denied by the Chinese government. "China has an army of people hacking into our systems. They are engaged in industrial espionage on a massive scale," Lord West told BBC News. He is particularly concerned about the deal between BT and Huawei, which gives the Chinese telecoms giant access to Britain's telecommunications network, as highlighted earlier this year in a highly critical report by the intelligence and security committee. But the former Home Office minister says he is relatively relaxed about a Chinese company taking a stake in Britain's nuclear industry, beyond the "embarrassment" of living in a country that is no longer capable of building its own reactors. "We probably don't have to worry too much, as long as we have a separate and free state with a Parliament that retains control," he says. It is not as if China is a rogue state or about to go to war with Britain, although, he adds, things could change. "In 50 years time you never know what will happen. If someone knows your critical infrastructure very well they can do damage to it." There are also concerns about China's human rights record, which does not seem to have been mentioned by Chancellor George Osborne in his meeting with Chinese officials, despite a new Foreign Office 'action plan' urging firms to pay more attention to the issue. "It could set a dangerous precedent," says an Amnesty International spokesman, "If other countries see Britain doing business with China without mentioning human rights then they will follow suit." The key question for many, however, is why can't Britain, the country that pioneered civil nuclear energy, build its own reactors? The UK is uniquely relaxed among Western nations about foreign ownership of key national assets like nuclear power plants, says Antony Froggatt, lead author of the annual World Nuclear Industry Status Report. In the US, Australia and Canada foreign companies are prevented by law from owning critical infrastructure. EDF was recently blocked from building a third reactor at the Calvert Cliffs nuclear plant, in Maryland, due to America's ban on foreign ownership. In some European nations, state-backed "national champions", such as EDF, dominate the nuclear market, while in others, such as Germany, the industry is being wound down. British companies will be involved in building new nuclear plants, says Mr Froggatt, and there is nothing to stop the government breathing new life into Britain's own nuclear industry, which once led the world. But nuclear is a "very risky" investment without massive public subsidies, due to the long lifespan of the plants, and even mighty state-backed enterprises now like to spread the risk by seeking partners. It is also an increasingly niche business. At the nuclear industry's peak in 1979, there were 234 plants under construction around the world. Now there are just 66 - 28 of which are in China. "If you were to build up a new industry you would be better doing it in other fields," says Mr Froggatt. But he adds: "I hope that the government, by encouraging this Chinese investment isn't promising that Chinese reactors will be built in the UK because it hasn't got the power to do that." The current design of Chinese reactors would be unlikely to meet British safety standards. But experts say the real prize for the Chinese is to gain approval from the UK nuclear industry regulator, known as one of the toughest in the world, for a new generation of designs, which could open the door to Western markets. Mr Froggatt is also concerned that the political consensus in the UK, with all three main parties now firmly behind nuclear energy, has prevented tough questions being asked about the wisdom of the current policy. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, quizzed about the China deal on his weekly LBC radio show, summed up the government's laissez fare approach. "If people want to come here and build safe sustainable low-carbon ways of generating energy without dollops of British taxpayers' subsidy in a way which is entirely regulated by us, where the rules are set up by us, not in Beijing, then of course that's something we should be open to. "Because we've got to keep the lights on and we've got to protect the environment." </body>

      <description>More 'plebgate' allegations in growing power struggle</description>

      <body>Tonight yet another serious allegation in what is fast becoming a power struggle between the police and Parliament. An allegation that chief constables overruled a proposal to charge their own men with misconduct. An allegation that - once again - centres on the way Andrew Mitchell was forced from his Cabinet job for calling an officer a "f***ng pleb" - something he insists he never actually said. The minister's fate was effectively sealed after that fateful night in Downing Street when a couple of weeks later he met three representatives of the Police Federation. They stand accused of lying about what was said by Mr Mitchell at that meeting by none other than the Prime Minister himself. "Fortunately, this meeting was recorded, so he has been able to prove that what he said was true and what the police officers said was untrue," David Cameron told MPs. The officers have been effectively cleared of misconduct by their bosses - the Chief Constables of West Mercia, the West Midlands and Warwickshire - who found there was insufficient evidence against them. But the prime minister is echoing the police watchdog in declaring that to be wrong. Tonight the Independent Police Complaints Commission has gone even further revealing that the police forces involved changed their minds about their own investigation. A letter from the IPCC's deputy Chair states that: "I note that in the first draft ...the senior investigating officer did in fact conclude there was a case to answer for misconduct although their final report submitted in August did not" MPs on the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee have asked the three chief constables involved to come down to Westminster to help them with their enquiries into what on earth went on. "The fact that there is now indications of a second report - the first having been changed - is a serious alteration to the story and we need to look carefully at why there was that change," its Labour chair Keith Vaz has said. What might seem a horribly complex story is in fact rather simple. A growing number of politicians suspect the police have been systematically covering up wrong doing by those in their own ranks. </body>

      <title>Elderly care all sorted? Think again...</title>
      <description>Many pensioners face significant fees before they get help</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24534268</url>
      <date>1381842445</date>

      <body>When the government unveiled its plans for a £72,000 cap on elderly care costs from 2016, ministers were quick to claim they had solved the problem. The era of huge bills for care, an issue which resulted in tens of thousands of people selling their own homes each year, was over, they said. But as politicians and campaigners sift through detail it is becoming more and more clear that all is not quite as it seems. One of the measures trumpeted by ministers was the fact that the bill individuals face could be deferred by getting councils to pay for the care and then allowing them to recoup it from an individual's estate after their death. This option is already available in some areas, but under the changes every council would have to offer it, they said. But it has now emerged the option of deferring payments will not be open to wealthier people. Only those needing residential care who have assets of less than £23,250 (excluding the value of their home) will be able to get their local council to pay the costs. For example, it means someone with £50,000 in the bank when they enter a care home will have to pay the bills as they come in until that has been reduced to £23,250. Only then will they be able to defer the costs. Labour peer Lord Lipsey believes this is such a significant loophole that it amounts to a "sabotaging" of the safeguards. The £72,000 cap will not include the amount an individual pays for the "hotel costs" of a care home - that is to say the normal cost of daily living such as food, energy bills and the accommodation. Under the reforms, these so-called "hotel costs" will be set at £12,000 a year. For a typical care home place that accounts for about a third of the fees. Therefore, it would mean that an individual could find themselves paying over £100,000 over three years (£72,000 in care fees and £36,000 in hotel costs) before the cap kicks in. And once it does they will still be liable for the £12,000-a-year hotel costs until their wealth is whittled away. With any system, there is always winners and losers. In this case it is those in the middle. The poorest will continue to get social care free as they do now. But those with assets of over £118,000 (including the value of property) will be liable for care home costs until they reach the £72,000 cap or their assets fall below the £118,000-mark. It means those with assets of between £150,000 and £200,000 face losing between a third and nearly a half of their in care costs. That compares to 0% for people with below £17,000 and a sixth for those with £500,000. Those even wealthier than that lose even less. It will be up to local authorities to calculate how much an individual has to pay. They will do this by working out the average they pay for care home places for those who get state help. This will stop people moving into a luxury care home and racking up £72,000 in costs in super quick time. Fair enough, you might say. But the problem - recognised by the Health Select Committee earlier this year - is that councils, with the benefit of buying places in bulk, can often negotiate lower fees than an individual can. This could lead to disputes over what the true costs are. The original proposals suggested setting the cap at a much lower level. But in the end ministers came up with the figure of £72,000. This was not plucked out of thin air. Once a person enters a care home, not many live beyond two years. In that time just those requiring the most intensive care are ever likely to accrue bills in excess of £72,000. It means only an estimated one in eight people will benefit from the cap, according to estimates by the government. And that is why Age UK, which has been campaigning for years for reform of the social care funding system, sees the cap as only a start. It argues the cap only benefits those with "the greatest needs" who end up in care homes "for a considerable amount of time". </body>

      <title>The reshuffled face of politics</title>
      <description>What impact will the frontbench changes have?</description>

      <body>Reshuffles. Like the old cliché about buses, you wait ages for one then three come along at once. But how much of an impact will the latest changes in personnel have? Inside the coalition, the Conservative and Lib Dem leaders independently decided the fate of their ministers. And Ed Miliband, no longer encumbered with a shadow cabinet chosen by his MPs, had a free hand to promote fresh talent. But has the political territory shifted, or is it just the personalities that have been moved? In some ways, the face of politics is changing. Across the board, women are taking more prominent roles - so far, a net increase of four in government, and 44% of Labour's shadow cabinet are female. Among the beneficiaries are two former stars of GMTV - Esther McVey for the Conservatives, and Labour's Gloria De Piero. The equation telegenic + down to earth = promotion has been proven. Though some rather less telegenic but talented people have done well too. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class as well as gender. That isn't a misprint. For the Conservatives, the reshuffle has also, in part, been about class. What some of our tabloid colleagues have depicted as a process of replacing the "top hats" with the "flat caps". In fact Monday didn't really amount to a revolution in millinery. It's simply that some of those who haven't been to public school are winning more prominence. Racing up the junior ranks is Sajid Javid, son of a bus driver from Rochdale. And Mike Penning - a plain-speaking former soldier and fireman - will welcome the challenge of taking the heat for welfare reforms. As a former spokesman for Iain Duncan Smith, he should, at least, have a good working relationship with his boss. So expect some of the non-cabinet ministers to speak with less expensive accents. Allies of the chancellor have also done well from the reshuffle: the aforementioned Mr Javid; Matthew Hancock, a former chief of staff to George Osborne; and the former Treasury whip Greg Hands, are all moving up. Their careers may be moving forward but their advancement doesn't signal a change in direction. None of the better-known Conservative figures around the cabinet table have been moved - any purge at the top will await the outcome of next year's European parliament elections. It was, in fact, Nick Clegg rather than David Cameron that engaged in the night of the long knives. Or, rather, the long knife. It was plunged into the front rather than the back of Micheal Moore, the Secretary of State for Scotland. He had very competently carried out negotiations on the forthcoming referendum on Scottish independence. But now that thorny issues over timing and, crucially, what question to put to the Scottish people, have had been smoothed over, it was felt that it was time to move on from the constitutional niceties and in to campaigning mode. So step forward the robust figure of the former Lib Dem chief whip Alistair Carmichael, whose job it is now to tweak Alex Salmond's tail. But at more junior level, Jeremy Browne was dismissed. This surprised some at Westminster as he had been seen as close to Nick Clegg, and he could never be described as a coalition-sceptic. Certainly working with Conservative ministers didn't seem to trouble his conscience. So it's possible that the Lib Dem leader - while continuing to liaise closely with David Cameron's colleagues - also wants his own ministers to spell out the differences between the two coalition partners more clearly in the run-up to the next election. But even Lib Dems raised eyebrows at Mr Browne's replacement at the Home Office, the former transport minster Norman Baker, the author of a book alleging a cover-up over Dr David Kelly, the government scientist whose death led to the Hutton inquiry. At first glance Ed Miliband's reshuffle marks more of a shift in position - away from his party's Blairite past. At education, Stephen Twigg - who had praised a "free school" in his area and worked hard to find a way of reconciling Michael Gove's creations with Labour's existing (and more hostile) policy - has been dumped from the shadow cabinet, as has Liam Byrne - the former shadow work and pensions secretary who accepted the principle of a cap on benefits payments. And it just so happens that in an interview with the left-of-centre New Statesman earlier, the leader of the Unite trade union Len McCluskey had described both politicians in unflattering terms. Labour sources, naturally, say that Ed Miliband didn't discuss his reshuffle with union leaders. And certainly Tristram Hunt's appointment to replace Stephen Twigg hardly marks a lurch to the left. He is close to Peter Mandelson and was parachuted into his Stoke constituency at the last election with the blessing of the then leadership. And while he has reportedly described free schools as "a vanity project for yummy mummies", expect him to champion "parent-led academies" in the future . Rather, he represents a bit of generational shift - someone who is younger than the Labour leader (not yet 40) and who can potentially appeal beyond the Westminster village - albeit to viewers of TV history shows on BBC Two and Four, rather than breakfast telly. Labour insiders say they wanted to make space for some of the 2010 intake who could prove to be energetic campaigners. That was more important than whether they were Brownite or Blairite, David or Ed. The new shadow women's and equalities minister Gloria De Piero is an admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as her party leader. And there was additional ballast against the "Blairite purge" stories - which some of the papers will write tomorrow - in the shape of Lord Falconer. He is Tony Blair's former flatmate and he has agreed to advise the party on the transition from opposition to government. The shunting of the former shadow transport secretary Maria Eagle to the environment brief has led to speculation that Labour is preparing to derail HS2. Instead, party sources insist, Mary Creagh's move to transport from shadowing Defra is a tribute to her campaigning flair during the horsemeat scandal. She is now going to be tasked with standing up not for the consumer but the commuter, arguing against higher fares as part of Labour's pre-election theme of tackling what it calls the cost-of-living crisis. But if she is a fan of HS2, she may have to turn her campaigning skills to greater effect against some of her shadow cabinet colleagues who think the money could be better spent. Amongst the sceptics is Ed Balls, supportive of the rail project in principle, but in practice stressing he can't back it "at any price". And the shadow chancellor, like his opposite number, will be pleased to see some of his key allies in important posts - including Rachel Reeves, his former number two, taking over the work and pensions brief, and Vernon Coaker moving to shadow defence. Michael Dugher, a redoubtable attack-dog who initially backed Ed Balls for leader, has been given a key role in planning for the next general election. He will be joined by Douglas Alexander (in addition to his foreign affairs role) and Spencer Livermore - the former Gordon Brown apparatchik who was - he believed unfairly - criticised by some of his colleagues for the handling of the 2007 election-that-never-was. Well, with fixed-term Parliaments now, there is little doubt when the next election will come. But perhaps the wider significance of the Labour reshuffle is what it says about the other Ed. The fact that Messrs Twigg and Byrne accepted demotions, and Jim Murphy moved from defence to international development, suggests that his leadership is secure - that there is no prospect of a shadowy group of Blairites outside of the shadow cabinet waiting - or campaigning - for Ed Miliband's political demise. At least, not this side of an election. So, in the days and months ahead, the battle lines will be more clearly drawn between rather than within the parties. </body>

      <body>The EU has a reputation for being slow and cumbersome - largely because of the difficulty of getting agreement among 28 member states with different languages and traditions. Here BBC Europe correspondent Matthew Price gives a video guide to the complex bargaining that results in new EU laws and the EU budget. The right to initiate legislation in the EU belongs to the European Commission - the union's civil service and rule-enforcer. Usually Commission proposals go through many amendments before becoming law - a process that takes years. In most policy areas the Council of Ministers - representing EU governments - and the European Parliament reach joint decisions through negotiation. Their role is called "the ordinary legislative procedure". During their negotiations they come under pressure from lobby groups, for example industrial firms or environmentalists. Often EU laws arise because national governments and MEPs tell the Commission that there is a need for them. Public consultations, scientific research and impact assessments also feed into the legislation. Once a measure becomes EU law the member states have two years to adopt it nationally - "transpose" it, in the jargon. The Commission can fine them for failure to do so. The budget is one of the most contentious policy areas among the member states, whose priorities differ greatly. The 2013 EU budget is 132.8bn euros (£113bn; $178bn). The size of the budget has to be decided annually, but there is also a seven-year budget framework, agreed in advance so that money can be set aside for long-term projects. This year for the first time EU leaders agreed to cut the multi-year budget (for 2014-2020), under pressure from the UK and some other countries, including the Netherlands and Sweden. The eurozone crisis has exacerbated tensions in the budget negotiations. Net contributors to the budget - the richer countries including the UK - argue that it should reflect the tough austerity policies adopted nationally. But net beneficiaries, such as the new member states in Central and Eastern Europe, oppose EU cuts to key areas like agriculture and infrastructure projects. EU spending is a small fraction of what the national governments spend in total, but those governments have to pay for big public sector areas like education and health, which are largely outside the EU's remit. </body>

      <title>Major piracy site to be shut down</title>
      <description>IsoHunt, a major website that indexed illegal files, is to close and pay $110m (£68m) to a US movie industry body.</description>

      <body>IsoHunt, a popular website offering BitTorrents of mostly pirated material, is to shut down following a court settlement. The site's owner, Canadian Gary Fung, has agreed to pay $110m (£68m) to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA). MPAA chairman Chris Dodd said the move was a "major step forward" for legitimate commerce online. In a blog post, Mr Fung said: "It's sad to see my baby go." The site is currently still online, but will soon be shut. It is one of the most popular sites of its kind on the internet. A group of companies, including Disney, Paramount and Twentieth Century Fox, accused the site of wilfully infringing copyright by listing millions of popular movies and TV programmes - in a court battle that has lasted for more than seven years. Now Mr Fung has agreed to settle. He added: "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race and I have remained faithful. 10.5 years of IsoHunt has been a long journey by any business definition and forever in internet start-up time. "It started as a programming hobby in my university days that has become so, so much more." Court documents acknowledged that it is unlikely that Mr Fung's company could pay $110m, and that the MPAA would probably receive between $2m and $4m. Like a similar site, The Pirate Bay, that has been blocked in the UK by a court order, IsoHunt did not host pirated material itself. It instead acted as a directory of sources from which to download illegal files. According to court documents, Mr Fung's defence hinged on this degree of separation - and argued that it was the users of IsoHunt responsible for distributing pirated material, not IsoHunt. The Californian court disagreed. "It sends a strong message that those who build businesses around encouraging, enabling, and helping others to commit copyright infringement are themselves infringers, and will be held accountable for their illegal actions," said MPAA chairman Mr Dodd. "The successful outcome of this landmark lawsuit will also will help preserve jobs and protect the tens of thousands of businesses in the creative industries, whose hard work and investments are exploited by sites like IsoHunt." Ahead of the ruling, Mr Fung had taken to social news site Reddit to take part in an AMAA - Ask Me Almost Anything - session. In it, he described himself as a "reluctant revolutionary", and backed calls for copyright reform. He said he did not hold a disregard for the law, and acted upon requests to remove links to pirated content when the company was made aware. He also said the industry could render sites like IsoHunt obsolete if it offered simultaneous releases worldwide, as well as digital offerings that were cheaper than physical copies. His thoughts echoed findings by a trio of researchers at George Mason University in Virginia, US. Their site piracydata.org has been collating the weekly top 10 most-pirated films and investigating whether legal digital methods were available. They found that half of the movies in the list were not available to access legally online. Furthermore, none of the 10 titles could be streamed - arguably the most straightforward way to consume media online. However, in contrast, efforts by Fox to curb piracy of TV series The Walking Dead fell flat. Despite the first episode of the latest series being made available to stream free online, the programme was still illegally downloaded more than 500,000 times, according to data gathered by Torrentfreak.com.

      <title>Ship trackers 'vulnerable to hacks'</title>
      <description>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacks and exploitation, security experts warn.</description>

      <body>A system used globally to track marine activity is highly vulnerable to hacking, security experts have warned. Weaknesses in outdated systems could allow attackers to make ships disappear from tracking systems - or even make it look like a large fleet was incoming. Researchers at Trend Micro said their findings showed the danger of using legacy systems designed when security was not an issue. But one vessel-tracking specialist said spoof attempts could be easily spotted. Lloyd's List Intelligence's Ian Trowbridge said that in addition to the vulnerable technology - known as the Automatic Identification System (AIS) - other measures could be used to identify marine activity. "The spoofing would immediately be identified by [Lloyd's List Intelligence] as a warp vessel," he said, "providing unexplained position reports outside of the vessel's speed/distance capability and thus subject to further investigation and validation." The AIS system is used to track the whereabouts of ships travelling across the world's oceans. For ships over a certain size, having AIS fitted is mandatory under international maritime law. It is designed to transmit data about a ship's position, as well as other relevant information, so that movements can be seen by other boats as well as relevant authorities on shore. One other use is to alert nearby ships when a man or woman is overboard - an alert that can easily be spoofed, says Trend Micro's Rik Ferguson. "It boils down to the fact that the protocol was never designed with security in mind," he told the BBC. "There's no validity checking of what's being put up there." Using equipment bought for 700 euros (£600), the researchers were able to intercept signals and make vessels appear on the tracking system, even though they did not exist. In one example, the team was able to make it look as if a ship's route had spelled out the word "pwned" - hacker slang for "owned". The information broadcast by AIS is public - but when the system was first put in use, in the early 1990s, the technology required to receive the information was prohibitively expensive for those not directly involved in the industry. But now, a typical internet connection can be used to see the locations of boats, as well as an indicator of what type of cargo they may be carrying. There has been speculation that Somali pirates have been making use of the system. "It has long been thought that the pirates are basically using AIS as a shopping list," Mr Ferguson said, "seeing what's coming into local waters, and what cargo it may have." However, Lloyd's List Intelligence noted that captains are permitted to disable AIS if they feel their crew could be endangered by it. Follow Dave Lee on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC </body>

      <title>LED 'li-fi' step closer, says China</title>
      <description>Chinese scientists say they are closer to achieving wireless internet connectivity through light bulbs, rather than traditional radio frequencies.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24579776</url>

      <body>Wi-fi connectivity from a light bulb - or "li-fi" - has come a step closer, according to Chinese scientists. A microchipped bulb can produce data speeds of up to 150 megabits per second (Mbps), Chi Nan, IT professor at Shanghai's Fudan University told Xinhua News. A one-watt LED light bulb would be enough to provide net connectivity to four computers, researchers say. But experts told the BBC more evidence was needed to back up the claims. There are no supporting video or photos showing the technology in action. Li-fi, also known as visible light communications (VLC), at these speeds would be faster - and cheaper - than the average Chinese broadband connection. In 2011, Prof Harald Haas, an expert in optical wireless communications at the University of Edinburgh, demonstrated how an LED bulb equipped with signal processing technology could stream a high-definition video to a computer. He coined the term "light fidelity" or li-fi and set up a private company, PureVLC, to exploit the technology. "We're just as surprised as everyone else by this announcement," PureVLC spokesman Nikola Serafimovski told the BBC. "But how valid this is we don't know without seeing more evidence. We remain sceptical." This year, the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute claimed that data rates of up to 1Gbit/s per LED light frequency were possible in laboratory conditions, making one bulb with three colours potentially capable of transmitting data at up to 3Gbit/s. Li-fi promises to be cheaper and more energy-efficient than existing wireless radio systems given the ubiquity of LED bulbs and the fact that lighting infrastructure is already in place. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum and 10,000 times bigger than the radio spectrum, affording potentially unlimited capacity. But there are drawbacks: block the light and you block the signal. However, this is also a potential advantage from a security point of view. Light cannot penetrate walls as radio signals can, so drive-by hacking of wireless internet signals would be far more difficult, if not impossible. Prof Chi's research team includes scientists from the Shanghai Institute of Technical Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the report says. She admitted that the technology was still in its infancy and needed further developments in microchip design and optical communication controls before it could go mass market. Her team is hoping to show off sample li-fi kits at the China International Industry Fair in Shanghai on 5 November, the report said. </body>

      <body>Criminals who trade in child abuse images are to be targeted in a new British-American task force. Police Minister Damian Green will fly to the US later to formalise arrangements for the new body. The agency will be co-chaired by Mr Green and US Attorney General Eric Holder. Mr Green said: "Child abuse and exploitation online are not restricted by borders and our efforts to combat them should not be either." He went on: "British and American parents rightly expect us to do all we can to protect our children and that is why I want to agree to a much closer working relationship in this area. "This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this sickening crime." Mr Green will sign a memorandum of understanding between the two countries in the next few days. The Sun on Sunday reported that as part of the trip Mr Green will meet senior figures within the FBI, Homeland Security and other law enforcement agencies. Internet companies are also being called on to share information with their British counterparts. The move follows the 22 July announcement from Prime Minister David Cameron that most households would have sexually explicit material blocked by the internet provider unless they chose to opt out. Joanna Shields, UK business ambassador for Digital Industries and a former Google and Facebook executive, will be the industry lead for the project. She told the Sun on Sunday: "The US-UK Taskforce will play a critical role in taking forward the Prime Minister's commitment to eradicating exploitative material from the internet and keeping our children safe online. "I strongly believe that industry and government can successfully tackle this problem together. "I look forward to working with the brightest minds in the industry to develop truly innovative and creative technical solutions that will help protect the most vulnerable in our society." </body>

      <body>The creators of legendary adventure game Myst are seeking cash for a new game via Kickstarter. Cyan Worlds is looking for $1.1m (£679,000) from the crowdfunding site to develop a game called Obduction. The game-maker said its new title would be a spiritual successor to its earlier point-and-click adventure games Myst and Riven. If Cyan reaches its funding target it plans to release PC and Mac versions of Obduction in mid-2015. Released in 1993, Myst was a huge hit thanks to its sumptuous look, detailed world-building and intricate puzzles. On its Kickstarter page, Cyan said Obduction would continue with these traditions but update them to take advantage of the power of modern computers. It said the game would use the Unreal 4 game development engine to create a detailed far-flung world that players find themselves upon at the start of the game. Playing Obduction involves exploring the world, solving puzzles and working out why the player has been abducted and taken to the alien planet. The cash being sought was for the most basic version of the game, said Cyan. Cash raised beyond the original total would go towards making the game world bigger and moving the title to other gaming gadgets beyond PCs. Cyan said it was turning to Kickstarter because it allowed the company to connect with fans, meant it had control of development and ensured everyone involved had an intimate link to the project. Nathan Grayson at PC game news website Rock, Paper Shotgun said the "meagre" information provided by Cyan did not give a good idea about how the final game might turn out. He wondered if the game would reach its funding target despite getting pledges of more than $100,000 within a day of being kicked off. "Obduction really does feel like it'd be a shoo-in if it wasn't currently a pile of napkin scrawlings and a series of excited hand gestures," he wrote. </body>

      <body>Google shares have topped $1,000 (£617) for the first time, jumping 13.8% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Shares in the online giant closed 122 points up at $1,011.4, and have risen 42% since the start of 2013. Friday's share price rise followed the company posting a 36% jump in net profits to $2.97bn for the July-to-September period on Thursday. Google's revenues also beat forecasts with a 12% rise year-on-year. "We are closing in on our goal of a beautiful, simple, and intuitive experience regardless of your device," Google's chief Larry Page said in a conference call with analysts. The strong earnings report also helped other online companies, with Facebook shares adding 4.4% to a new high of more than $55. Amazon rose 3.4%. Google's market value is about $334bn, which is still well below Apple's $461bn. Google was floated in August 2004 at $85 a share, giving the company a market value at the time of $23bn. The company reported its quarterly earnings on Thursday after US markets had closed. Google said that paid-for clicks increased by a quarter during the July-to-September period, from a year earlier, the highest rate of growth in the past year. This offset an 8% fall in average cost-per-click, the price advertisers pay Google when consumers click on their ads. "We view solid paid clicks growth to be a good indicator of demand, driven by the continued shift to mobile," JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Several brokers have raised their share price target for Google on the back of the company's new initiatives to attract advertisers. In February, the company launched a service to help advertisers market through a mix of smartphones, tablets and desktop computers. And analysts believe there is still significant potential to generate revenues from its video-streaming website YouTube. YouTube-branded video-ads surged more than 75% in the quarter from a year earlier, with 40% of traffic now coming from mobile devices. "We estimate that Google's key YouTube asset generated approximately $4bn in revenue in 2012, positioning Google extremely well for the strong growth in video advertising," RBC Capital Markets analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Jefferies said Google is best positioned to benefit from mobile devices with one billion activations of its Android system. Google sells applications and content through its Google Play store. </body>

      <description>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has released the Windows 8.1 update for its flagship operating system. The download seeks to address some of the criticisms levelled at the original version of Windows 8. In particular, the update restores the start button and allows a computer to boot up with a traditional desktop interface. The launch comes at a critical time for Microsoft as it seeks a new boss, with PC sales experiencing a long decline. Windows 8 sought to bridge the gap between touchscreen devices, such as tablets and smartphones, and more traditional form laptops and desktop machines. As such it had an interface built of tiles that could be tapped or swiped to open applications. However, many people found the tiled interface did not work well for some of the things they were used to doing with a computer. The changes in 8.1 include: A host of other changes, including better support for multi-tasking and improved links to Microsoft's Xbox game console, are also in the update. Windows 8 was created to capitalise on the growing popularity of tablets and other portable gadgets. Microsoft needs to get people using its software on these machines because sales of desktop machines are in sharp decline. Global shipments of PCs hit a five-year low in early October, according to figures from market research firm Gartner. Sales of PCs had now fallen for six quarters in a row, it added. The downward trend in sales statistics were confirmed by IDC, which added that the decline would probably continue into 2014. The shrinking sales are important for Microsoft because traditionally the bulk of its revenue comes from people and companies buying laptops and desktops and office software to run on them. It is not clear that Microsoft is adjusting to the changes in the types of gadgets that people use. In July, Microsoft wrote off $900m (£559m) following poor sales of its own-brand Surface touchscreen devices. At the same time, Microsoft has undergone a major reorganisation and has bought phone maker Nokia. It is also launching a new version of its Xbox games console and has begun searching for a new chief executive. Servers ready to dispense the update were turned on at 07:00 New York time (12:00 BST). The update is free to those already running Windows 8. Charges will apply if users upgrade to 8.1 from Windows 7. The update comes just over a year after the launch of Windows 8. </body>

      <body>US intelligence leaker Edward Snowden has insisted he took no classified documents to Russia when he fled to Moscow from Hong Kong in June. He told the New York Times he had given all the papers to journalists in Hong Kong and had kept no copies. Mr Snowden, who worked for two US spy agencies, also said no confidential information had been passed to China. The US authorities want Mr Snowden extradited to face trial, but Russia has refused to hand him over. The Russian authorities gave him a one-year visa earlier this year after he claimed asylum. Mr Snowden told the US newspaper that he did not take any of the documents because it would not have been in the public interest. "What would be the unique value of personally carrying another copy of the materials onward," he said. Claims had surfaced in media reports that China was likely to have gained some intelligence from the former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor before he left Hong Kong. Some analysts had suggested he was working with Chinese intelligence, while others said he was working with the Russians. But Mr Snowden rebuffed these claims, saying: "There's a zero per cent chance the Russians or Chinese have received any documents." He said his last job for the NSA had focused on China, and he had "access to every target", so he felt confident that the data was safe from Chinese agencies. The New York Times report said its interview was conducted over several days via encrypted networks. The information leaked by Mr Snowden has led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale of governments, businesses and members of the public. Targets have included rivals like China and Russia, as well as close allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. </body>

      <title>Adidas smartwatch has pulse sensor</title>
      <description>Adidas announces a touchscreen colour watch that can measure its owner's heart-rate to create tailored training programmes.</description>

      <body>A watch with a colour touchscreen and built-in heart monitor that studies the wearer's pulse to create training programmes has been unveiled by Adidas. The gadget - which is being targeted at runners - also includes a GPS location chip to maximise the accuracy of its readings. It marks a move by the German firm into the smartwatch sector, although the device does not run third-party apps. The news comes the same week as rival Nike updated its own activity tracker. The two companies - which are best known for their sports clothing and shoe ranges - are taking different approaches with their flagship products. At $399 (£350 in the UK) Adidas's Micoach Smart Run is more than double the price of Nike's $149 Fuelband SE. But it offers a wider range of sensors as well as the ability to play MP3 audio files to wireless headphones via Bluetooth. It also has the advantage of offering partner apps for Android, Windows Phone and iOS devices. By contrast, Nike only offers a Fuelband app for the iPhone. The US firm does, however, offer a separate Nike-branded watch made by the Dutch firm TomTom that features a GPS chip and can be paired with a heart rate strap made by another company. Adidas announced its new product at Gigaom's Mobilize conference in San Francisco. It said athletes could use the watch to create a coaching programme to improve their fitness levels and would then receive feedback via animated graphics on its screen, vibrations, and audio commands - using paired headphones - telling them to speed up or slow down. The new device is bigger than less advanced digital watches and screenless activity trackers also sold by Adidas, but its 1.45in (3.7cm) display is smaller than the screens on Samsung and Sony's new smartwatches. The Galaxy Gear and Smartwatch 2 both offer a range of activity apps of their own as well as other Android software, but rely on being paired with a smartphone for much of their functionality. Adidas says its product's battery lasts about 14 days when its tracking sensors are switched off. However, that drops to just four hours when it is switched into "training mode". Motorola's Motoactv watch may be its closest competitor. The gadget also features a GPS chip and MP3 player, but not a pulse rate sensor of its own. Consultancy Juniper Research recently predicted the wider wearable tech market will grow from $1.4bn of sales this year to $19bn by 2018. However, it suggested that sales of specialist fitness tracking equipment and watches that are, in effect, slaves to smartphones will be cannibalised by more powerful standalone devices. "The products currently available in the market only appeal to a niche demographic, but as we move towards the age of a true multifunctional smartwatch we expect them to become more appealing," said its senior analyst Nitin Bhas. "We believe players like Apple, Google and Microsoft will release devices that can acts as a fitness tracker, as a digital wallet, as a way of offering ticketing and coupons, and all sorts of other things. To be honest, the market is still waiting for a killer app. "There is an opportunity for Adidas here - but along with start-ups entering the wearable tech sector, it has a very narrow window and is likely to struggle as the marketplace becomes increasingly crowded." Adidas said it would start selling the new watch next month. </body>

      <title>EE rapped over 'misleading' maps</title>
      <description>The Advertising Standards Authority asks for changes to EE's mobile coverage checker following a complaint about its accuracy.</description>

      <body>The Advertising Standards Authority has ordered EE to change its mobile coverage checker after a customer complained it had wrongly told him he would receive excellent service in his area. The checker must make it clearer that it is only a guide, the ASA said. The decision is likely to have an impact on other mobile operators offering similar maps. Mobile coverage can vary widely from street to street. It depends on a variety of factors, including the density of buildings and the number of trees in the area. Despite the fact that the EE coverage map has an addendum which states that it is "only a guide and not guarantee of service availability in a particular location", the ASA still felt the ad was misleading Its ruling stated: "We noted that the claims under the coverage results were presented in language that was not conditional and consider the overall impression of the ad was such that it was likely to be understood to mean that fast reliable internet access and high quality calling was available... to consumers in the relevant postcode." In response EE said: "The Coverage Checker offers a prediction of our network coverage across the UK. In this instance, we deemed coverage to be Excellent in the postcode as confirmed by testing that found over 98% of the postcode had an excellent signal." "We take on board the ASA's ruling and will amend the disclaimer language as necessary," it added. EE customers are given a 14-day cooling off period if they are not happy with the mobile service after signing a new contract. O2 also points out that customers have a seven-day window to cancel their service if they find it is not as good as expected. "Our coverage maps are created on accurate predictions of the network, but unfortunately they can't always take into account a number of factors affecting signal like building structures and natural landscape," the mobile firm said in a statement. "We're making daily improvements to our network and our coverage maps for 2G, 3G and 4G are updated to reflect these on a weekly basis." Most operators have ambitious plans for 4G coverage, both indoors and outdoors, with most planning to reach around 98% of the population by 2017. But it is notoriously hard to produce accurate mobile coverage maps. All the operators produce their own and use different metrics for measuring coverage. Some have called on Ofcom to produce its own coverage map, something that the regulator has rejected. There are a few independent coverage maps available from firms such as RootMetrics and OpenSignal. Matthew Howett, analyst with research firm Ovum said: "While the operator's own coverage checkers are usually very accurate, they don't all necessarily measure the same thing. For instance some might only be for outdoor coverage, whereas others will also give you an idea what you can expect indoors. "Given these peculiarities, they are useful only up to a point for consumers when making comparisons between networks," he added. </body>

      <title>Google shares hit record highs</title>

      <body>Google has reported a profit of $2.97bn (£1.84bn) during the July -September period, beating expectations. The company missed forecasts during the last quarter. However, a closely watched measure, cost per click - how much advertisers pay to place an advert - declined by 8% from the same period last year. Shares in the company jumped to an all time high in after hours trading, rising 6% to $941.25. Google boss Larry Page said in a statement that: "Google had another strong quarter with...great product progress". Overall, paid clicks increased by 28% from the same time last year, and were up 8% from the previous quarter. This is taken as a good sign by analysts, as advertising makes up the dominant share of Google's profits. The company's troubled Motorola unit continued to be a drag on the figures, however. It lost Google $248m, despite the launch of the flagship Moto X phone in August. Mobile battle In a call to discuss earnings with investors, Mr Page highlighted just how dominant mobile has become among consumers. He said that 40% of users reached YouTube through their mobile phones compared to just 6% two years earlier. Analysts were closely watching how Google is faring in this mobile transition, particularly as it relates to advertising. Google charges less for mobile than for its traditional web browser ads, which is why even though ad sales increased throughout the quarter, the cost per click figure declined. Research firm eMarketer estimates that the mobile ad market worldwide will grow 89% to $16.65bn this year; up from $8.8bn in 2012. Google's market share in the ad market is 6.9%. This has recently slipped slightly as rival Facebook has made inroads. Facebook now has 14.9% of the market, a jump from 9% last year. In a personal move, Mr Page said that he would no longer be participating in every earnings call. While he said this move was intended to better prioritise his time, many observers noted that his voice remained strained after surgery to repair an injured vocal chord. </body>

      <title>Bumper security update for Java</title>
      <description>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots 51 separate security holes in the software.</description>

      <body>Oracle has released a bumper update package for Java that closes lots of security holes in the software. The update fixes 51 separate security bugs in Java, which owner Oracle says is used on billions of devices. About a dozen of the bugs were serious enough to allow attackers to take remote control of a compromised system, researchers said. Java is one of the most popular targets for cyber-thieves and malware writers seeking to hijack home computers. In its advisory about the update, Oracle urged customers to patch the software as soon as possible "due to the threat posed by a successful attack". Programming language Java has proved popular because software written with it can easily be made to run on many different types of computer. Twelve of the holes in Java addressed by the update topped the table that ranked the severity of security weaknesses in software, wrote Qualys security expert Wolfgang Kandek in a blogpost. If these bugs were exploited, attackers could bypass ID controls and take over a target system, he added. He said those seeking to exploit Java would probably seed web pages with booby-trapped links in a bid to catch vulnerable machines. Security glitches in Java are favourites among those that write and run so-called "exploit kits" that seek to compromise vulnerable websites and other systems. Security blogger Brian Krebs said if people needed to run Java, it was well worth taking time to apply the update. Those that did not need the software should consider disabling it altogether, he said. "This widely installed and powerful program is riddled with security holes, and is a top target of malware writers and miscreants," he wrote. The update is available via the main Java website and has prompted follow-up action from other electronics firms. Apple has released an update to the version of Java that runs on its computers. This update points people towards the official version of Java from Oracle instead of that supplied by Apple. In the past, Apple has faced criticism over the speed with which it updated its version of Java. </body>

      <title>Watch Dogs delay wounds games maker</title>
      <description>More than a quarter of Ubisoft's market value is wiped out after the French video games publisher delays the launch of hacker-themed title Watch Dogs.</description>

      <body>Shares in video games firm Ubisoft have slumped by 26% after it delayed the release of two much-anticipated titles. Hacker-themed Watch Dogs and open-world racing game The Crew have both been postponed until the publisher's next financial year, which begins in April. The company said it wanted to allow its developers to fine tune their work. Watch Dogs had been due to go on sale on 19 November and will miss out on being a launch title for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Retailers, including Amazon and Gamestop, have assured consumers who had pre-ordered bundles including both the Chicago-based title and one of the games consoles that they will still receive the machine on the day they had been quoted. The Crew had originally been due out some time in the first three months of 2014. France-based Ubisoft has had success with its Assassin's Creed, Just Dance and Splinter Cell franchises. However, it warned that the delays meant it was likely to swing to an operating loss when it declares its full-year results. Chief executive Yves Guillemo called the move a "tough decision". "We are building franchises that will become perennial pillars of Ubisoft's financial performance," he added. "In a context of growing successes for mega-blockbusters, the additional time given to the development of our titles will allow them to fulfil their huge ambitions and thus offer players even more exceptional experiences." A blog posted by the Watch Dogs development team added that it planned to launch the game before the end of June. "As we got closer to release, as all the pieces of the puzzle were falling into place in our last push before completion, it became clear to us that we needed to take the extra time to polish and fine tune each detail so we can deliver a truly memorable and exceptional experience," it stated. Ubisoft added that The Crew would now go on sale before the end of September. The news caught many analysts by surprise. To make its November debut, the "gold master" version of Watch Dogs' code would have needed to have been finalised soon in order for the discs to be manufactured and shipped to stores in time. It is unusual, though not unknown, for a game to be pulled so late in development. In February, Ubisoft delayed its platformer Rayman Legends by half a year, less than a month before it had been due to go on sale. Perhaps the best known example was Valve's announcement in 2003 that its sci-fi action sequel Half-Life 2 was to be delayed, just a week before its scheduled launch date. It went on to become one of the best reviewed games of all time. One industry watcher said a short-term view by investors had caused the firm's stock to dive, but that Ubisoft was better off doing this than releasing Watch Dogs in a state that required later software patches to address major faults. "I think it was going to be one of the drivers for initial games-console bundle sales and will probably push back some of the hardware sales that would have happened right out of the gate for Sony and Microsoft," said Lewis Ward, video games research manager at consultants IDC. "But absolutely it's the right decision if there's something glitchy or there's some game-balance factor that is off. "There's a lot of interconnections between the things you can control in the game and how the story then unfolds, so I can only assume there's some factor with the incredibly complex open-world gameplay that's off. "But there's no reason Ubisoft can't still deliver what they hoped to do with this game." </body>

      <title>Samsung offers to end patent wars</title>
      <description>To avoid a huge fine for allegations that it has abused the patent system, Samsung has waved the white flag on patent wars.</description>

      <body>Samsung has said that it will stop taking rivals to court over certain patent infringements for the next five years. The white flag in the patent battle has been raised because the South Korean electronics firm faces a huge fine for alleged abuses of the system. The move could help end a long-running patent war between the world's largest mobile makers. The EU said that a resolution would bring "clarity to the industry". "Samsung has offered to abstain from seeking injunctions for mobile SEPs (standard essential patents) for a period of five years against any company that agrees to a particular licensing framework," the European Commission said in a statement. Standard essential patents refer to inventions recognised as being critical to implementing an industry standard technology. Examples of such technologies include the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS), a cellular standard at the heart of 3G data; and H.264, a video compression format used by YouTube, Blu-ray disks and Adobe Flash Player among others. The EU had accused the Samsung of stifling competition by bringing a series of SEP lawsuits against Apple and other rivals. Google's Motorola Mobility has been charged with similar anti-competitive practice. Samsung faced a $18.3bn (£11.3bn) fine if it was found guilty of breaching anti-trust laws. "Enforcing patents through injunctions can be perfectly legitimate, said Joaquin Almunia, the European Commission's vice-president in charge of competition policy. "However, when patents are standard-essential, abuses must be prevented so that standard-setting works properly and consumers do not have to suffer negative consequences from the so-called patent wars. "If we reach a good solution in this case, it will bring clarity to the industry," he added. Samsung and Apple are currently battling each other in courts in more than 10 countries across Europe. Interested parties have been given a month to comment on the proposals. </body>

      <title>Flossie the computer to be rebooted</title>
      <description>The National Museum of Computing announces plans to resurrect one of the oldest business computers still in existence.</description>

      <body>Efforts to reboot one of the oldest surviving mass-produced computers are under way in Milton Keynes. The National Museum of Computing has taken delivery of what it believes is the last ICT 1301 computer to ever have a chance of working again. The machine - known as Flossie - had originally been used to produce exam results for students at the University of London. The museum hopes to put it on display by 2016. One of its trustees said Flossie was one of the first computers specifically designed for use by UK businesses rather than scientific institutions. "Before this time, computers were absolutely huge with valves and thousands of vacuum tubes and would get incredibly hot, making them difficult to house in a normal business," Kevin Murrell, a trustee of the museum, told the BBC. "But this machine used transistors, which used very little power. That meant you could have more of them in the same space, you didn't need the complex cooling equipment and you wouldn't require the high power that earlier computers needed." ICT 1301s had a footprint of about 6m by 7m (20ft by 23ft) and weighed some five tonnes. They came with a punch card reader and printer built in to their body, which were used to enter and save data by means of creating a series of holes in a piece of stiff paper. "For medium-sized companies that wanted to computerise their invoicing, their accounting or their payroll, this gave them the help to do that," added Mr Murrell. The University of London bought its machine in the 1960s and used it for accounting and administration tasks in addition to generating GCE examination results for students in England and Wales. It was later sold at scrap metal value to a group of students before eventually ending up at a farm in Kent, whose owner donated the machine to the museum. Other editions of the machine were later used as props thanks to their arresting design. Doctor Who, the Pink Panther and the James Bond movie The Man with the Golden Gun all featured ICT 1301s. Over the years more than 150 computers were created, but the charity said it was only aware of three others being left in existence, all of which are beyond repair. "One of the problems with computers as museum artefacts is that when they are switched off they are fairly boring - it's fairly difficult to learn anything from them," explained Mr Murrell. "So ideally we want it switched on, and once we've restored it we will be able to run the original software. "We will have caused some damage in the move, so we need to deal with that, but I think in about three years' time we will have a properly demonstrable machine." </body>

      <body>The slot-car racing games of the 1980s are being revisited with a modern twist. San Francisco start-up Anki is releasing a new type of gaming concept, which fuses real-world robotics with the artificial intelligence made possible by smartphones. A smartphone app wirelessly communicates with toy cars, equipped with cameras and sensors to help them beat human competitors. The start-up has already received $50m (£31m) of venture capital for what it sees as a new area of consumer entertainment to exploit. But is the $200 (£125) racer a game-changer? The BBC's's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor went along to Anki HQ to find out. You can follow Richard on Twitter @RichTaylorBBC. </body>

      <body>The head of Europe's crime fighting agency has warned of the growing ability of organised crime groups to mount cyber-attacks in drug trafficking operations. The director of Europol, Rob Wainwright, has told the BBC that along with online drug selling, the internet has become "a primary facilitator of the international drug trafficking business". His comments follow a cyber-attack on the Belgian port of Antwerp, in which drugs traffickers are alleged to have recruited hackers to breach IT systems which controlled the movement and location of containers. Prosecutors say the cyber-attack allowed them to steal entire containers in which cocaine and heroin had been hidden. Danny Decraene from the Antwerp organised crime unit of the Belgian Federal Police has been telling the BBC's Tom Bateman how the hackers are thought to have breached IT systems. </body>

      <description>How to attract girls to the tech industry</description>

      <body>Anne-Marie Imafidon is in a rush to get on with life. Perhaps that is why she passed a GCSE in computer science aged 10, became the youngest graduate to attain a masters degree, aged 19, and is already planning the future of her unborn children. And if daughters come along she is clear that she doesn't want them to "feel like the odd ones out," if they decide, like her, to pursue a career in technology. As a self-confessed stubborn woman, she hopes she can succeed where others have failed - in reducing the huge gap between girls and boys studying so-called Stem subjects - science, technology, engineering and maths. To do this, she has set up Stemettes, which she runs when she isn't in her day job at a global investment bank. She was one of just three girls in a class of 70 studying maths and computer science at university. "At the time I wasn't that bothered, I just thought it was part and parcel of studying computer science," she says. "But then last year I spoke at a conference and I heard that the numbers of women in technology was in decline and I thought, 'That isn't right.' "Technology is at the forefront of the economy and women have a vital role to play. When my daughters are born I don't want them to feel like the odd ones out." The UK has a massive skills gap. Only 17% of the UK's tech jobs are held by women. In Stem subjects generally women make up just 13% of the workforce. In engineering women fare even worse, taking up just 8% of the jobs. So where does it all go wrong? At secondary school, girls are as likely as boys to study Stem subjects, at least up to GCSE, but for A-levels and beyond, female representation drops off dramatically. And among girls who carry on and study science at university, two out of three don't go on to Stem-related careers. The reasons for the drop-off in interest are multiple, thinks Ms Imafidon. "Some schools, often girl-only schools, simply don't offer ICT [information and communications technology] at A-level and the girls wanting to do it have to go to a nearby boys school to learn it," she says. "In other schools, computer science often clashes with things like drama or music, meaning the girls can't do both. If every other girl is doing drama, you'd want to be in a class with all your friends rather than take the difficult route and do computer science." Girls are very aware that their choice of A-level subjects impacts what they study at university and which one they go to. It means that girls tend to choose "safe" subjects that they know they will get a good grade in, according to Ms Imafidon. "Choosing computer science is an unnecessarily tough choice and one you aren't going to make unless you are one of the stubborn girls like I was," she says. It isn't like that everywhere. Brazil punches above its weight, ranking highest overall in the representation of women in science and technology, according to a report from Women in Global Science and Technology. Much of that is down to programmes that support women in the workforce, good funding for education and research and support of female entrepreneurship. South Africa and India also score well. For Ms Imafidon, it is because ITC has a very different image and status in these countries. "In India if you go into technology, it is because you want to do well and get ahead in life. If you see a well-dressed women walking down the street, you don't ask is she a lawyer or a banker but is she working in IT," she says. The aim of Stemettes and other sister organisations is to replicate in the West what is happening in the developing world. To facilitate that, the group runs events around the country aimed at getting girls interested in technology. Girls are introduced to a range of women already working in Stem subjects and are invited to take part in events such as hackathons. "We get them making mobile apps, data visualisations, having fun," says Ms Imafidon. The fact that they can do all this surrounded by other girls makes them more confident. "Coding clubs are dominated by boys. We want to make our club as normal for girls as ballet," says Ms Imafidon. At the end of the month the group will host a hackathon in Oxford, and in November it is running an exhibition at the Crystal in London's docklands. Girls aged from seven to 22 will be invited to take a variety of workshops, including dance and science, 3D printing and one on nuclear substances. The goal of Stemettes and its sister organisations is to get the women in the Stem workforce up to 30% by 2020. When you consider that women began coding 200 years ago, it seems like a fairly realistic ambition. This week saw the annual Ada Lovelace day, which every year celebrates the achievements of the Victorian woman credited with writing the first piece of code for Charles Babbage's analytical engine. The fact that Mrs Lovelace was coding in an age when even few men were, shows that there is no inherent aptitude problem, thinks Ms Imafidon. "It isn't that girls can't do it, it is that they are choosing not to do it," she says. "She was doing it 200 years ago so we have no excuse." </body>

      <body>The pursuit of artificial intelligence has long interested computer scientists, but will machines ever think for themselves, asks Lisa Jardine. In the early 1950s, "machine intelligence" was a favourite topic among those who wanted to put the war years behind them and look forward to a sparkling science-led future. From robots to electronic brains, the idea was that human beings would be able to concentrate on useful work, while programmable machines took care of useless toil. That unrealised dream still intrigues us today. In April 1951 I was taken by my parents on an outing to the Bristol laboratory of neuroscience professor William Grey Walter, to see his robotic tortoises. In a large room, half a dozen domed mechanised devices on wheels (roughly resembling tortoises) twirled and gyrated, avoided obstacles, backed away from the edges of their enclosure, and trundled apparently purposefully towards a light source beamed in their direction. These, Grey Walter maintained, were the beginnings of artificial intelligence - machines which simulated human thought and behaviour using analogue electronics to mimic brain processes. I remember the grown-ups were delighted. Back then, aged seven, I was a bit disappointed. These weren't "toys" in any sense that I understood. But the memory of the visit flooded back last weekend when I encountered a piece of archive film of the tortoises in the Codebreaker exhibition at London's Science Museum. Codebreaker charts the life and legacy of the troubled mathematician Alan Turing, best known for his crucial work on the Bombe electro-magnetical device, used to crack the code created by German Enigma machines during WWII. The exhibition includes the story of Bletchley Park, and the top secret cryptographical work Turing and others carried out there, which made such a vital contribution to the Allied victory. But it also explains a wide range of other work on early computers and machine intelligence. The Grey Walter tortoises feature as an early example of a complex machine which appears to replicate human behaviour - in other words, to think. Turing's own contributions to mathematics, and in particular to the theory behind early computers and computing went far beyond his wartime activities. Before he was recruited to the Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park in 1938 he had been working on the idea of a machine which could be programmed to carry out many different mathematical operations or tasks - the precursor for the electronic data processors we take for granted today. After the war Turing returned to this topic, and in 1950 published a paper entitled Computing Machinery and Intelligence, which is still cited today. In it, he speculates on what it would take for a computer to be considered to have gone beyond performing human-programmed tasks to become a "thinking machine". "I propose to consider the question," his paper begins, "Can machines think?" Arguing that they can, Turing chooses to engage directly with a computing pioneer of a century earlier who had given consideration to the question but reached the opposite conclusion - Ada King, Countess of Lovelace, or Ada Lovelace as she is generally known today. This week we celebrated Ada Lovelace day - an occasion on which we honour Lovelace herself and all other women working in what today are known as the STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). So let me say a little more about her before I get on to Turing's interest in her argument about machine intelligence. Lovelace was born in 1815, the only legitimate daughter of Lord Byron. Privately educated in science and mathematics, her mother was determined she should not become a poet like her father. She is acknowledged to be an important contributor to the early development of the computer and computer programming. Aged 17, Lovelace met Charles Babbage, conceiver of the Analytical Engine and regarded as the father of computing. His engine was never actually built, but is nevertheless generally recognised as the abstract precursor to a "universal machine" - one which can be programmed to perform a potentially infinite range of human tasks. Lovelace immersed herself in understanding the potential of the Analytical Engine. In the process she became possibly a clearer and more incisive exponent of it than Babbage himself. In 1842, at Babbage's request, Lovelace translated an Italian article discussing the potential of the Analytical Engine. She added a series of discussions of her own, explaining the possibilities for the engine and offering further explanation in considerable mathematical detail. These notes were approved by Babbage before publication, but Lovelace insisted on retaining total control. In late July 1842, for instance, she writes: "I am much annoyed at your having altered my note. You know I am always willing to make any required alterations myself, but that I cannot endure another person to meddle with my sentences." It is to these notes that Turing is referring a century later in his 1950 article. In one of them Lovelace says: "It is desirable to guard against the possibility of exaggerated ideas that might arise as to the powers of the Analytical Engine. The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths." We do not know how Turing came across Lovelace's notes. But he devotes a significant portion of his 1950 paper to countering what he calls "Lady Lovelace's objection" and he quotes her verbatim. Her objection, he proposes, is tantamount to saying that "computers can never take us by surprise". Indeed they can, he counters. He believes Lovelace was misled into thinking the contrary because she could have had no idea of the enormous speed and storage capacity of modern computers, making them a match for that of the human brain, and thus, like the brain, capable of processing their stored information to arrive at sometimes "surprising" conclusions. Probably the easiest way to understand what Turing had in mind is to think of the Google search engine. Initially it amazed us simply with its ability to search apparently instantaneously through every word currently on the world wide web. Now you can watch as you type, as it rapidly scans every search it has ever processed, to anticipate what you are looking for and suggest to you the question you might be just about to ask. However Turing came to read Lovelace's notes on the Analytical Engine, he considered her important enough to engage with in print. I like to think that he recognised her as a kindred spirit. She was a mathematically precocious woman, considered scandalous for her unashamed desire to engage in intellectual debate on equal terms with men. Turing was an introverted, mathematically gifted boy whose open homosexuality made his life extremely difficult, and who committed suicide in his early 40s. For both, understanding the intricate mechanisms of the mind was a goal to be pursued tirelessly and passionately, while the trials of the body were as far as possible set aside and ignored. Their encounter does help us to understand the magnitude of Lovelace's achievement. When Turing argued that machines would eventually be able to think, he had in front of him at Manchester University a truly programmable machine, the precursor to the Atlas computer - Britain's first "super-computer". Lovelace by contrast had only the idea of a computer on which to base her equally clear conviction that machines would only ever be able to do what we asked them to. Sixty years after Turing's death, when our mobile phone has 1000 times the speed and memory capacity of the Atlas computer, she has not yet been proved wrong and personally, I'm with Lovelace. But let me end with Turing. In August 1951 he and four friends visited the Festival of Britain in London - that "tonic to the nation" devised by the Labour government to foster British pride and optimism for the future. In the festival's science exhibit in South Kensington they spent some time watching Grey Walter's tortoises. They were not particularly impressed - the tortoises seemed to spend most of their time going round and round in circles - although they did like the way the tortoises responded to their own reflections in a mirror. But this wasn't much fun. They quickly abandoned South Kensington, and went instead to the festival funfair in Battersea where they thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It was one of the few happy occasions in the last years of Turing's life of which we have a record. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Olive Uwineza is 12 years old and dreams of becoming president one day. She sits in a class of about 30 pupils, at a high-tech primary school in Kigali, Rwanda. Each student has a green, white and orange laptop that uses cartoon animations to make lessons more fun. A lover of maths and science, Olive says tackling these subjects without computers "can make my lessons difficult". Five years ago, an initiative called One Laptop Per Child (OLPC) was introduced to the school, led by the government and NGOs. It has seen 200,000 laptops distributed in more than 400 schools across this tiny east African nation. Facilities at Olive's school have been upgraded and modernised, with access to wi-fi, and software tailored for the curriculum. The OLPC programme is one of the pillars of Rwanda's Vision 2020, which aims to turn the country into a knowledge-based economy similar to that of Singapore in South East Asia. In the wood-panelled halls of his official office, we meet President Paul Kagame, who has personally been a driver of this vision. He says information technology will help to turn Rwanda into a regional tech hub that will help Rwandans "find jobs, feed their children and regain their dignity". The tragedy of the 1994 genocide is a strong motivation for President Kagame. In his view, better access to information might have helped victims and perpetrators make different political choices. For him, the IT revolution is not only about modernising the Rwandan economy - at the core, it's about healing the nation. Mr Kagame has presided over an era of robust growth in Rwanda. Last year, the economy grew by more than 7%. Government reforms have encouraged foreign investment and the World Bank has ranked Rwanda the third best country in sub-Saharan Africa in its "Doing Business" index. But all of this could be undermined by the recent diplomatic tensions with donors. Rwanda has been accused of helping train child soldiers for rebels in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo, though it has strongly rejected the allegations. In October, the US imposed sanctions on Rwanda, which may have an impact on the government's ability to pursue future economic programmes that support Vision 2020. Undeterred, government agencies continue with their work. Clare Akamanzi is the chief executive of the Rwanda Development Board, tasked with turning Vision 2020 into tangible social programmes. She says Rwanda aspires to "evolve from being an agriculture-based economy to a knowledge-based economy, mainly on high value services". In 2013 a deal was concluded with Korea Telecom to provide 4G technology across the country. At $140m (£87m) this is one of the biggest foreign direct investment deals in Rwanda. The state has laid 3,000km of fibre-optic cables over the last four years and hopes that 4G will help provide last-mile access to all communities outside of the capital, where internet connectivity is low. Clare Akamanzi says they are taking additional steps to ensure this happens. "We've built tele-centres, we've built service points, there's a communal infrastructure where we've put computers," she says. "We've also used ICT buses where we take mobile buses all over the country so people can just come and learn how to use a computer." But new technology isn't working for everyone. At a grain market on the outskirts of Kigali, traders are buying sorghum from local farmers. A mobile phone application called e-Soko was given to farmers in 2007. The app is designed to save farmers time and help them find the best deal, by sending automated text messages with the latest market prices. The farmers here, though, say they still prefer the more traditional method of face-to-face bartering. "When I call with my phone there's that possibility of an interaction," farmer Jean Baptiste Nzabamwita says. "We can bargain and say come, we can raise the price up to this one. But [with] the e-Soko... the prices are not reliable." This is just one small example of how society can sometimes resist the changes brought about by IT. Rwanda is still a largely traditional and rural country, therefore attempts to modernise the economy will have to go apace with the needs of the population at large. So does President Kagame's IT agenda come at the expense of more practical realities like healthcare, housing and rural development? His answer is simple: "The proof of the pudding is in the eating…. and we've been rewarded by progress." </body>

      <title>Silk Road: Will cybercrime evolve?</title>
      <description>Is society safer after the illegal marketplace's demise?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24526677</url>

      <body>Silk Road, the infamous online marketplace for drugs and other illegal goods, was closed down by the FBI earlier this month. Since then its alleged founder, Ross Ulbricht - who denies being the site's operator known as Dread Pirate Roberts - has been taken into custody, and police forces around the world have been making arrests. It is a blow to the sale and distribution of harmful substances, including cocaine and heroin, as well as disrupting other criminal activities arranged online, such as the sale of weapons and hitmen for hire. But for how long will society have been made safer? Does it mean the end for illegal marketplaces hidden in the so-called "deep web", which depend on the anonymity provided by the Tor network and the Bitcoin digital currency to attract buyers and sellers? Or is it little more than a minor inconvenience? One man with first-hand experience of FBI takedowns is Emmanuel Gadaix. He was one of the directors of Megaupload, the popular file-sharing website founded by Kim Dotcom that was closed down by the US Department of Justice in January 2012. "This changes nothing in the same way that the closure of Megaupload changed nothing," he says. "All that happens if you bust him [Dread Pirate Roberts] is that two new people come along. "The closure of Silk Road is no more the end of online narcotics sales as the arrest of Al Capone was the end of organised crime." Another man with similar experience is a twenty-something expat Irishman who calls himself H2.0. He is the ex-spokesman for a deep web drugs marketplace called Atlantis, which was closed down by its operators shortly before the Silk Road takedown for "security reasons". Criminals may be more than willing to prey on others, but when it comes to their own dealings they want to feel safe, and H2.0 says Silk Road had managed to build a strong brand in the underworld. "It was a pillar of trust in an otherwise Wild West of dodgy scamsites," he says. But he is sure an alternative to Silk Road will emerge. "We could be in for a period of sites popping up for a few months and closing [just] as fast. Silk Road will be replaced fast but the trust will take longer." Other marketplaces for illegal goods still exist in the deep web - Sheep and Black Market Reloaded (BMR) are two of the better-known ones - and it appears that former Silk Road sellers are already setting up shop in them. "I do know one vendor who was previously one of the top-selling vendors on Atlantis," H2.0 adds. "He moved to Silk Road as soon as Atlantis closed, and two weeks after Silk Road closed he is already set up on Sheep and BMR. "Vendors even seem confident enough to carry forward the same usernames and reputations from Silk Road, which shows they don't seem too worried about being tracked." But security expert Brian Krebs thinks the takedown is significant. "It once again dispels the myth of anonymity on the web, or in this case on the deep web," he suggests. "That's a big deal because clearly many buyers and sellers in this community were under the impression that their actions somehow could not be traced online." In the future, illegal deep web marketplaces are likely to attempt to reassure drug dealers and their customers that their communications with each other are secure by making it easy to encrypt conversations. It turns out that a software package called BitWasp that aims to provide this is already under development, and as an open source project will be available free to anyone who wants it. The man behind BitWasp is known in internet circles as afk11. He currently spends between 30 and 50 hours a week developing it, he tells the BBC. He describes himself as unemployed, 21 years old and from Ireland. Afk11 claims his motivation is to help promote the virtual currency Bitcoin, suggesting it could become a popular way to pay for concert tickets and other events. "Just because people want to remain private doesn't mean things are suspicious," he says. But does he believe that drugs marketplace operators will also use his software? "The short answer would be yes, they probably will," afk11 says. "We're not specifically gearing our project towards the 'dark web' although it will certainly have features which are popular on it, such as PGP encryption. "But it's more important to us that Bitcoin becomes adopted by the masses." The next generation of illegal marketplace operators will be much harder for the FBI or other law enforcement agencies to catch, according to a Bangkok-based security expert and broker of security exploits known as the Grugq. "You can be famous, or a criminal, but you can't be a famous criminal," he says. "[Dread Pirate Roberts] was advertising everywhere and attracting attention - which is never a good thing." He says that the new marketplaces will last longer because the operators won't make the same mistakes. "Each bust works as evolutionary pressure, selecting out the insecure sites and training the other ones what to do better, so there will be better and better services (for buyers and sellers) with each iteration of these marketplaces after each bust," he says. Mr Krebs concurs: "Denizens of these communities will learn from their mistakes... with the result that the up-and-coming communities probably will be more difficult to penetrate and take down." But the Grugq believes that despite the protection and anonymity that Tor, Bitcoin and encryption can provide, many marketplaces and their users will get caught thanks to old-fashioned police techniques. "What you will see with these sites is that as they become higher-profile, undercover agents will infiltrate them as vendors or customers," he says. "They may even work their way into the inner circle and become administrators working for the site." One thing the Silk Road takedown has done is show that operators of illegal marketplaces can and do get caught. And ultimately it's the fear of that happening that may put many people off embarking on a criminal career in the deep web. "I think a legit career move is best for me," H2.0 concludes. "Whoever wants to be the next Dread Pirate Roberts better be able to handle the stress. I didn't like it." </body>

      <title>Nike and the battle for your wrist</title>
      <description>Can fitness trackers change your behaviour?</description>

      <body>Nike says its new activity-tracking Fuelband SE will motivate people to exercise even more. But can a wristband really lead to better health? Back in 2009, Nike vice-president of digital sport Stefan Olander and his team had an idea: what if a person could track how much they've moved in a day, just by glancing at their wrist? And so, the Nike Fuelband was born. Released in 2012, in a simple, sleek, black plastic design that flashed from red to green once a person's daily fitness goal had been met, the first Fuelband sold out in hours. The pitch was this: by wearing a Fuelband and monitoring fitness data via an app or on the web, anyone - from a professional athlete to Mr Olander himself - could work out a better, more effective, path to health. "In today's society, we are overwhelmed with complexity," says Mr Olander. With the Fuelband, he says, Nike really tries "to filter out what doesn't matter and just give you what you need in order to stay motivated." So what's different this time around? Nike says that in addition to making physical improvements to the latest Fuelband - better waterproofing, stainless steel screws - it has also analysed the data from the first wave of Fuelband adopters to see ways in which the band and its supporting iOS app and website could be improved. They found that 98% of their 20 million users exercised - but they didn't necessarily consistently move the recommended five minutes every hour. Now, the wristband buzzes to alert its wearer if he or she hasn't got up in a while. But Nike is not the only company experimenting with wearable technology - particularly as estimates about the potential growth in the industry range from $10bn to $50bn (£6bn to £31bn) in the next five years. Competitor Fitbit recently released a new model, and Jawbone, iHealth, Garmin, Withings and Adidas are among other firms to offer dedicated fitness-measuring gadgets. Samsung and Sony recently released a smartwatch that can monitor a user's steps, and even Apple - whose boss, Tim Cook, sits on Nike's board of directors - has expressed an interest in a device. But beyond these gadgets, Nike's main competition might not be a rival band, but the smartphone. "Smartphones are going to start doing more of the tracking, and more people have them already and don't have to buy separate devices," says Sara Watson, a fellow at Harvard University's Berkman Center for Internet and Society. Already, there is a spate of apps - from MyMee to MapMyRun - capitalising on these built-in features. Beyond the competition, there is also the basic question: can wearing a wristband really make you healthier? "The notion of tracking itself has been around a long time - this is not something new," says Michael Kim, a former Microsoft Xbox executive who is now the head of Kairos Labs. "The problem is tracking does not create new behaviour change - it tracks what you already do as a behaviour," says Mr Kim, whose firm works to help people cement their habits. But some doctors say the bands can help those who are already interested in exercise better tailor their workouts. "We have done a number of athletic performance tracking projects with people," says Dr Paul Abramson, a physician in San Francisco who uses tracking technologies in his practice. "Things like the Fuelband or more complex versions of them can be very useful for people who want to exercise more." Companies are also showing an interest in tracking sensors. In 2008 Bank of America equipped dozens of its call centre staff with special badges to study the way they interacted with each other as part of efforts to boost productivity. One technology consultant suggested several firms were now interested in using fitness equipment as a way of encouraging their staff to bond. "At a symposium event last week I was talking to a couple of companies that were trying to improve employee engagement, and there's some thinking that not only are healthier employees more productive but that their sharing of information about how much they are walking, how much they are riding etc is becoming the new 'water cooler' moment," says Mike Gotta from Gartner. However, he cautions that managers should resist the temptation to see the gadgets as the human equivalent of the black boxes used by some car insurance companies to track driver behaviour. "A few months back one firm made the news for saying: 'If you don't meet certain criteria we're going to charge you more per month for your healthcare.' That kind of behaviour could create a backlash," Mr Gotta warns. "But if firms give these analytics to the employees for their own self-improvement and are relatively hands-off, then the workers will share the information themselves and that could create better relationships across teams." Experts also note that gadgets like the Fuelband still have plenty of room for improvement. At present the measurements it captures are not always precise. Rivals are attempting to address this by offering a wider range of sensors. Withings, for example, has built a heart-rate monitor into its Pulse tracker; Polar's Loop carries out a similar trick by connecting its wristband to a separate accessory; Fitbit includes an altimeter in its new Force wristband to count the number of stairs climbed; while Motorola's Motoactv can be linked up with bicycle-fitted sensors that measure how fast the equipment is being pedalled and its speed of travel. Sensors that measure skin temperature, perspiration and the electrical activity produced by muscles offer further opportunities. "The fitness space has spawned a whole host of explorations of tracking devices in other areas," says Steve Dean, a partner at Prehype and a founder of the Quantified Self group in New York, which meets to discuss personal data tracking projects and technologies. "It's almost like there's an endless amount of things that we can instrument on our body." </body>

      <body>People around the world are building their own drones. They offer a glimpse of what life will be like when the skies are filled with small, flying robots - and drones become as common as smartphones. Raphael Pirker was sitting on a bench at Washington Square Park on a blustery Friday in New York. A small drone called Discovery, a remotely controlled aircraft made by his company, TBS Avionics, was on the bench next to him. Nearby another drone was flying near a fountain. Even before he saw the drone, he heard it. "It's just like this, 'bzz-bzz'," he said. An onlooker watched the aircraft - "a beginner drone", Pirker said, crash into the pavement. Down the block hundreds of people had gathered at New York University for a Drones and Aerial Robotics Conference. Like Pirker, many of them were carrying their own drones. On a global scale the US and Israel are the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. Yet some European officials want to change the dynamic. Michel Barnier, a European Union commissioner, told a group of French journalists in July that Europeans should make their own drones, rather than rely exclusively on US- and Israeli-made ones. Pirker is also planning for the future. In Europe drones are used to make movies (see Smurfs 2). In the UK officials have granted permission to more than 130 companies and government agencies to fly drones, according to an Aerospace America report. In the US the Federal Aviation Administration has approved the use of drones for police and government agencies, issuing about 1,400 permits over the past several years. The civilian air space will reportedly be open to all kinds of drones in Europe by 2016 - and in the US by 2015. Many of these machines will be small - like the ones Pirker makes. And cheap. You can make a drone, explained South-African-born Mike Winn, of Drone Deploy, for $500 (£310). Pirker, 29, is a Swiss-Austrian who lives in Hong Kong - "for business reasons". He wears rimless glasses, the kind once worn by Apple guru Steve Jobs, and he has light blue eyes. Pirker and the others at the conference belong to a new breed of drone maker. Many are global travellers, and most grew up on drones. At the conference 14-year-old Riley Morgan approached Pirker, carrying a drone he had made. Another enthusiast, Russell de la Torre, who is 31, made his first robot, "a remote-controlled truck with cardboard boxes", at age 12. Pirker started building model airplanes when he was six. "I got bored because they were just flying circles around," he said, spinning his hand in the air in a lazy manner. As an adult he said: "I had this crazy idea of flying [a drone] over the Statue of Liberty. "Everybody said, 'Don't do that - you're doing to get shot.'" "It was a strange feeling," he said, describing the day three years ago when the drone flew, as shown in this head-spinning footage. "It felt a little bit eerie because you're flying past so much history, you know, about America." Drones give one a different perspective. "It's not the plane that turns in the air - it's the world that turns," he said. Drones do more than provide material for trippy videos, though. They help farmers check on crops and allow journalists to report stories. But even small drones - like the kind Pirker makes - cause problems. "Every country has different rules, but we follow our own," Pirker said. "We're not going to hurt anybody. We do it with a little bit of play." Not everyone sees his drones as whimsical. Federal Aviation Administration officials tried to fine Pirker $10,000 for operating a drone in Charlottesville, Virginia, in October 2011. His lawyer filed a motion three weeks ago, describing the aircraft, a "five-pound radio-controlled model airplane constructed of styrofoam", as harmless. Small drones are usually benign. Yet they can be lethal. Roman Pirozek, 19, died last month in Brooklyn, NY, when his remote-controlled helicopter spun out of control - and hit him in the head. Small drones also provide new ways to spy. A Seattle woman felt uneasy about a drone outside her window, as she reported earlier this year on a blog. Amie Stepanovich, director of a project on domestic surveillance at the Electronic Privacy Information Center, thinks drones are cool - and said Pirker's video was "gorgeous". But drones also worry her. "They are helping to usher in a new age of physical surveillance," she said. "They provide a platform for some of the most invasive surveillance technologies we've ever seen." Pirker has a different perspective. Rather than causing anxiety, drones have helped him get over his fear of heights - a handicap, since he lives in a high-rise in Tseung Kwan O, outside of Hong Kong, on the 40th floor. As he sat on the park bench in New York, he stuck out his leg and jiggled it, showing what used to happen when he looked down from a window in a tall building. Now he said: "I just step back." </body>

      <title>Supercell: Europe’s supercharged games success</title>
      <description>Clash of Clans games developer Supercell's $1.5bn deal</description>

      <body>It is a Finnish company started in 2010, whose first products only emerged in 2011. You've probably never heard of Supercell, but on Tuesday it was valued at $3bn, making it the fastest growing technology firm to come out of Europe in, well, just about ever. Supercell is a games business with just two titles, Clash of Clans and Hay Day, which until last week could only be played on Apple's iPhone and iPad. But they have grabbed a huge share of the mobile gaming market, leading the world in terms of revenue, ahead of giants like EA which has 829 titles to Supercell's two. On Tuesday Japan's Softbank paid $1.5bn to acquire a 51% stake in Supercell. The telecoms firm is doing the deal in conjunction with its own gaming subsidiary GungHo, another major player in the new world of mobile games. This might look like another of those dotcom deals, where a wealthy corporate giant pays over the odds for a business with big user numbers but no concrete business plan. But Supercell is making money hand over fist - revenues grew from $100m in 2012 to $179m in the first quarter of this year and are on course to hit $1bn for the whole year. Key to its success has been its ability to crack the Asian market, something many other games developers have tried and failed to do. It has already been working with GungHo and has now brought its games to Android, essential for any firm competing in China. It all looks like a great success for Finland, also home of the Angry Birds firm Rovio, and for the wider European technology scene. Supercell was backed by London-based venture capital firms including Index Ventures and Atomico. They bought in at a valuation of $770m back in February, so have made their investment back four times over in the space of six months - though existing investors will retain half of their stakes in the business. That means more money will now be available to invest in other start-ups, and even if Supercell is now controlled from Japan, Tuesday's news will be a great boost for the image of the European games industry. The UK firm behind the phenomenally successful Candy Crush Saga, King.com, is currently working on its stock market debut, while the Moshi Monsters business Mind Candy is also rumoured to be thinking of an IPO. Both may end up on New York's Nasdaq over the next year. What is slightly disappointing is that these companies seem to be looking outside Europe - to Asia or the US - when they are seeking the funding they need to progress to the next stage of their development. But European games developers are showing that they have mastered what consumers want in the mobile world and using their skills to build big businesses in a hurry. </body>

      <title>7 reasons why Buzzfeed is the death/saviour of news</title>
      <description>Rory's 7 reasons why you cannot ignore Buzzfeed</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24532004</url>

      <body>The social news site Buzzfeed is growing at a scary rate, racing past serious news services like the New York Times - and the BBC - as the way younger people hear about what's happening around the world. It's even announced that it will be launching French, Spanish and Portuguese editions, using students and a language teaching platform called Duolingo to translate stories. So, in the spirit of a Buzzfeed list here are seven reasons why we should love/hate it: With 85 million visitors in August, it is fast becoming one of the most popular sites on the web. And look at where more than a billion Facebook users get their news - Buzzfeed is top of the list when it comes to stories shared by users, ahead of the Huffington Post, CNN and the BBC. And as the founder Jonah Peretti put it in a memo to staff, it's reaching an important audience: "The world needs sustainable, profitable, vibrant content companies staffed by dedicated professionals; especially content for people that grew up on the web, whose entertainment and news interests are largely neglected by television and newspapers." "This Baby Elephant Being Reunited With His Dad is The Cutest Thing You'll See Today" and "9 celebrity tweets you missed today" - if that is the future of journalism, heaven help us all… Some other Buzzfeed headlines today: "The Big Winner in JP Morgan's Earnings - lawyers", "Why These Three Economists Won The Nobel Prize", and "Blackberry's Last Ditch Attempt To Win You Over is Pretty Hilarious". There's business, technology and politics on Buzzfeed, and it's recruiting some serious journalist talent in the US and in London. When I met Jonah Peretti earlier this year and suggested that the cute and silly stuff was just part of a long term plan to fund serious investigative journalism he laughed. "You don't get it," he said. "We love the funny stories - it's what we're about." And some of the daft stuff is brilliantly done. Look at "The 29 Stages of A Twitterstorm." But serious or silly, it is all about clicks - any Buzzfeed writers who can't build an audience for their stories will soon be heading for the exit. The hardest trick in the modern media is making online news profitable - just ask anyone from The Guardian to The Sun. But as well as employing more than 400 people - technologists, journalists, marketing types - Buzzfeed is, according to Jonah Peretti, now making money. It was "accidentally" profitable once before in 2011, and then spent lots on expansion. Now it looks well placed to become a media powerhouse and without loads of intrusive advertising… Buzzfeed's clever trick is to teach advertisers to write Buzzfeed-like stories which promote their brands without in-your-face messages. On this morning's Today programme Jonah Peretti insisted that there was a clear division between "church and state", advertising and content. That may not be anything like as clear to Buzzfeed readers who click on "13 Signs You're Addicted To Fashion Blogs" without noticing that is sponsored by Blackberry UK. Mind you, whether that does any good to Blackberry is another matter entirely… 7. And here's a cute picture of a dog with a bandaged paw….. Well, if you can't beat them….. </body>

      <title>Why tech giants are investing in Africa</title>
      <description>Why the world’s technology giants are investing in Africa</description>

      <body>"I don't understand. Why is it that the media only seems to talk about Africa when bad things happen?" The man behind the counter at my hotel in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, was talking to me about my job, and why I was visiting. He looked genuinely pained. He told me he is a big fan of the BBC - in west Africa the World Service and language services have a big following - but it seemed to him that the media outside the continent often only noticed when bad things happened. It's arguably a fair point. That's not to say the positive stories don't get reported, but he can be forgiven for seeing the headlines and thinking all the world sees is war, famine and pestilence. In fact, Africa is booming, with growth of 5.6% predicted for 2013, according to the World Bank - although research suggests this has yet to trickle down to the very poorest on the continent. The middle class in sub-Saharan Africa is expanding rapidly. With the seemingly unstoppable growth of the mobile phone, greater access to the internet, and an increase in access to education, change is happening, and more people have more disposable income to spend. So it's no surprise that the big technology companies are investing in Africa. But is this the whole story? Is it driven by philanthropy or a desire to get in on the ground before their competitors? Or does Africa offer other opportunities? I spoke to three tech giants about why they were investing in the continent. The company has bolstered existing investments in the continent by opening a research facility in Nairobi, with the official inauguration celebration happening at the end of October. According to IBM, this is the first research facility that does both applied and exploratory research on the continent. "The key thing is… the great growth story of Africa," says Dr Kamal Bhattacharya, the director of IBM Research - Africa. "We know that financial inclusion is the big challenge. About 80% of the population has no access to financial services. There is the lack of access to energy, safe water, sanitation, food security. "As scientists we believe that science and technology is an enabler to express your needs, it is an enabler to shape your own future. "And this is why IBM is making this very significant investment into Africa, starting with Kenya. We've hired some of the top talent from all over the world, the African diaspora, people of African origin, also people who contribute to the growth of Africa, and we bring them all together here. "We believe research for Africa, solving Africa's grand challenges, has to be done on the ground in Africa and this is why we set up and made this investment." His colleague, Dr Uyi Stewart, is chief scientist at the lab. Originally from Nigeria, the role has brought him and his family back to the continent after nearly 10 years in New York. "People ask us: 'Can you do African research from New York?' Yes you can. It is possible, you can do research from anywhere. "But you will miss the mark... In order to capture value, and deliver innovation that leads to commercially viable products that impact people's lives, we have to be here, in the local ecosystem." Fernando de Sousa heads Microsoft's 4Afrika initiative, which focuses on encouraging innovation, increasing access to technology and building skills in the local workforce. The division backs projects across the continent including access to training, roll-out of broadband in rural areas, infrastructure, agriculture and healthcare projects, as well as their App Factories, hubs designed to nurture young developers creating apps for the Windows phone platform. Building these projects has a very personal resonance for Mr de Sousa, who was born in Mozambique and ended up spending time in a South African refugee camp as a child after the outbreak of civil war. "We said we want on focus on young people. We want to focus on skills, we want to focus on small and medium enterprises. We want to focus on access to technology. "Let's take Kenya - so we start with TV white spaces in a village in the Maasai Mara. "It's now evolved into a national policy conversation - President Kenyatta has said he wants 1.3 million students to have a [connected] device by September 2013. And he travelled to the Masai Mara to go and see what we're doing. "It's not just about networks, it's not just about PCs. It's about the end economic impact, it's about the skills. "[Now] we have 11 countries that have formally submitted requests for us to implement TV white spaces technology." But Mr de Sousa is clear about the motivation behind the initiative. "There is a corporate social investment part of Microsoft which has nothing to do with Microsoft 4Afrika. And I think that that is a well-established process, we do a lot of donations in that space. "This is about being on the ground and creating huge consumers. There's no debate about the fact that our objective is enabling economic development. "In proving the value of technology as the enabler for that development, it's not just creating consumption of technology, but it's actually more importantly creating the ability for knowledge to be developed, for technology to actually be built in Africa. "Because that actually drives the IT ecosystem, that drives the IT industry, that makes technology relevant." Isabel Kelly is the international director of the Salesforce.com Foundation, the philanthropic arm of the customer relationship management and services technology giant. She joined the company 11 years ago from campaigning group Amnesty International. The Foundation was started with an initial investment from the company, as well as access to Salesforce.com software, which is licensed to non-profits, and staff members volunteering. The first project in Africa for the Foundation was the suggestion of an employee, who had a brother who was volunteering in a school in the Kibagare slum in Nairobi. "We gave some refurbished hardware to them, we paid for them to get the internet," Ms Kelly says. "And so the school has taken on a bit of a focus on technology, we sponsored about 40 girls through the school, over the 10 years." One of the sponsored pupils from a particularly difficult background would go on to become a lawyer working for the Kenyan Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. The Foundation has its own revenue stream from the bigger NGOs it works with (customers include the Grameen Foundation) and also funds training in how to use the Salesforce platform, and workshops for start-ups at places like Nairobi's iHub and mLab. Meanwhile, a host of social enterprises are using Salesforce tech to power their organisations - like Juhudi Kilimo, a micro-finance social enterprise, focusing on small, rural farmers in Kenya, and Honeycare, an organisation that helps farmers turn to honey production. </body>
