      <body>Iran's foreign minister has expressed cautious optimism about upcoming talks on Iran's nuclear programme, saying the issue is "not insoluble". World powers and Iran are due to meet in Geneva later on Thursday for a further round of discussions. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said the talks would be "highly laboured" but the aim was to "cross over the wall of distrust" created by Western policies. The West suspects Iran of seeking to build nuclear weapons. Tehran says its nuclear programme is for peaceful purposes. In comments broadcast on Iranian TV on Thursday, Mr Zarif repeated Iran's long-standing assertion that to "refrain from seeking nuclear weapons is a policy of the Islamic Republic of Iran". The two-day meetings in Geneva come after the two sides described last month's discussions on the issue as "substantive and forward-looking". International negotiators said they were considering an Iranian proposal, although no details have been released. The latest round of talks bring together Iranian officials and representatives of the "P5+1" - the permanent members of the UN Security Council (Britain, China, France, Russia and the US) plus Germany - also known as the E3+3. Ahead of the meetings, a senior US administration official told reporters that Washington wanted Tehran to agree on a "first step" to stop advancing its programme further. The official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the US was hoping for "an initial understanding that stops Iran's nuclear programme from moving forward and rolls it back for the first time in decades". Last month, the EU's top foreign policy official, Catherine Ashton, said the the P5+1 and Iran had "their most detailed talks ever". Last month's talks were the first since Hassan Rouhani - seen as a relative moderate - became Iran's president in August. International negotiators want Tehran to take specific steps to prevent it from ever being able to make nuclear weapons. In return, they promise to lift some of the international sanctions imposed in recent years. Key international demands include the acceptance by Iran of a comprehensive verification regime - with unannounced checks - and a reduction in Iran's level of uranium enrichment. Iran subscribed to a fuller inspection regime under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which was known as the additional protocol, until 2006. Western nations have also been pressing for Tehran to halt the production and stockpiling of uranium enriched to 20% - a step away from achieving a nuclear weapons capability. They also want Iran to send some of its stockpiles abroad, and shut down the Fordo production site near the city of Qom, where most of the higher-grade enrichment work is done. Since 2006 the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions - including asset freezes and travel bans - on entities and people involved in Iran's nuclear programme. Separate US and EU sanctions have targeted Iran's energy and banking sectors, crippling its oil-based economy. Iran wants the sanctions lifted. </body>

      <description>Twitter shares are priced at $26 each, ahead of the biggest stock market debut of a technology firm since Facebook went public in 2012.</description>

      <body>Twitter shares have been priced at $26 each, ahead of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday. That is above the $23 to $25 range announced on Monday and values the short messaging service at more than $18bn (£11bn). That makes it the biggest market debut for a technology firm since Facebook went public in May 2012. Twitter has attracted 230 million users since starting seven years ago, but is yet to make a profit. Its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier and a recent poll by Reuters/Ipsos showed that more than a third of registered users do not use the service at all. Nevertheless there was strong demand for the shares and the company was able to raise the offering price twice. Some analysts said that investors were excited by Twitter's potential for growth. "Investors see social media and mobile as sweet spots and it is therefore no surprise that Twitter's IPO is creating so much excitement and is oversubscribed," said Eden Zoller of consulting firm Ovum. However, she added that "Twitter needs to step up and deliver on the expectations that are fuelling its valuation, and show that it has what it takes to provide a sustainable business model". The firm has posted an increase in its sales, which more than doubled in third quarter to $168.6m, and it is looking to raise even more revenue from advertisers outside the United States. Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets said that he expected the firm's shares to rise after listing. "Just as Google, Amazon and Facebook have become Internet utilities, so too may Twitter," he said. "As a public, real-time, conversational and distributed platform, Twitter is becoming an essential service for consumers, businesses, media companies, and advertiser." Twitter's $18bn valuation includes the value of shares in compensation schemes for employees and other share awards. Co-founder Evan Williams is the biggest shareholder in the firm with a stake of more than 10% worth more than a billion dollars. Another of the founders, Jack Dorsey, will also become a very rich man. His 4% stake is worth more than half a billion dollars. Biz Stone, another co-founder, is thought to have made millions by selling holdings over the last few years. But Noah Glass, also one of the originals, is believed to have made very little from the company's success. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise $1.82bn, for the company. Unlike Facebook, Twitter has chosen to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook's debut on the Nasdaq - traditionally the market of choice for technology firms - was marred by delays and problems with orders. The NYSE has already tested trading of Twitter's shares to try to avoid any technical hitches. The shares will trade under the symbol "TWTR". </body>

      <body>A torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics has blasted off into space - as part of efforts to showcase next year's games in Russia. A Soyuz rocket is delivering the torch to the International Space Station. On Saturday, two Russian cosmonauts will take it on a historic first spacewalk. The torch will not be lit. The event is part of a rebranding exercise by Russia, designed to portray it as a strong, modern country, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Baikonur. The Soyuz rocket blasted off at 04:14:25 GMT from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koici Wakata from Japan - are taking the torch to the ISS, which it is due to reach in six hours. The Olympic symbol will be handed over to fellow cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky, who are already on the orbiting station, when they go on the spacewalk on Saturday. "Our goal here is to make it look spectacular," Mr Kotov said earlier. "We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work." The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. The Sochi torch will then be returned to earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year. It is all part of the elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It is also the most expensive one so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. In yet another minor setback, the flame has gone out several times since the torch relay began last month. </body>

      <title>Japan to remove Fukushima fuel rods</title>
      <description>Nuclear engineers in Japan prepare to move more than 1,000 fuel rods from the crippled Fukushima power plant in a crucial, but risky operation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24843657</url>

      <body>A task of extraordinary delicacy and danger is about to begin at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power station. Engineers are preparing to extract the first of more than 1,000 nuclear fuel rods from one of the wrecked reactor buildings. This is seen as an essential but risky step on the long road towards stabilising the site. The fuel rods are currently in a precarious state in a storage pool in Unit 4. This building was badly damaged by an explosion in March 2011 following the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Moving the rods to safety is a high priority but has only become possible after months of repair work and planning. One senior official told me: "It's going to be very difficult but it has to happen." The fuel rods are four-metre long tubes containing pellets of uranium fuel and the fear is that some may have been damaged during the disaster. When the tsunami struck the Japanese coast, the flood swamped the diesel generators providing back up power to the reactors. Three of the reactors went into a state of partial meltdown. By coincidence, Unit 4 was undergoing maintenance, so all of its fuel rods were being stored. But the meltdown of a neighbouring reactor led to a build-up of hydrogen which is believed to have led to the explosion in Unit 4. In the days after the tsunami, there were fears that the blast had damaged Unit 4's storage pool and, in desperation, the authorities used helicopters and fire hoses to keep it filled with water. A guiding principle of nuclear safety is that the fuel is kept underwater at all times - contact with the air risks overheating and triggering a release that could spread contamination. So the operation to remove the rods will be painstaking. A senior official in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) told me that the rods will be lifted out in batches of 22 and in casks filled with water. This will be done with a new crane, recently installed in the wrecked building, after the original one was destroyed. The task of removing each batch will take 7-10 days, I understand. Two critically important issues are whether the rods themselves are damaged and therefore likely to leak and whether the casks remain watertight to ensure the rods have no contact with the air. The METI official acknowledged the risks including a possible "release of radiation" from the fuel or if the casks holding the fuel are dropped. He said that "countermeasures" have been prepared - including back-up wires to hold the loads and mechanisms to hold the fuel in the event of a power failure. A briefing document released by the site's owners, Tepco, spells out a series of safety systems designed to minimize the dangers. For example, the fuel pond itself has been strengthened while the new crane can handle loads of one tonne while the fuel cask only weighs 450kg. Collision tests, it is said, have shown that even if the fuel cask is dropped, it may be deformed but its seals will not be broken. The fuel rods will then be deposited into a new "common" pool with a cooling system. According to the METI official, "the common pool is planned to be used over a long period, supposedly for 10 to 20 years, and will be reinforced against possible future earthquakes and tsunamis". The Tepco document says the rods will be checked for signs of damage - large amounts of debris fell into the pool during the disaster so the risks are real. It says that checks for corrosion have found only minor signs so far - with "no corrosion affecting fuel integrity". But only when the operation begins will engineers get a detailed look at the rods and a chance to assess their state. One senior figure in Japan's nuclear watchdog told me: "Inspections by camera show that the rods look OK but we're not sure if they're damaged - you never know." He said Unit 4 presented particular dangers because its entire stock of fuel rods was in the pool at the time of the accident. If the operation goes as planned, attention will then focus on the massive challenges posed by Units 1, 2 and 3. According to the METI official, the latest investigations have shown that despite the meltdowns experienced by each reactor, their temperatures have now stabilised. In Units 1 and 2, readings show the presence of water in what's called the primary containment vessel - suggesting that the melted fuel rods have not penetrated that safety barrier. The radiation level is too high in Unit 3 for that kind of examination to be carried out but using data from the reactor pressure vessel the official assumes that water is also present in the primary containment. Meanwhile, the site continues to be plagued by leaks of radioactive water flowing into the Pacific Ocean. Tepco will not confirm the precise timing of the fuel rod operation but after so much public outrage at the company's handling of the crisis so far, scrutiny of this latest episode will be intense. </body>

      <title>Greek police clear broadcaster's HQ</title>
      <description>Greek riot police clear the headquarters of former state broadcaster ERT, evacuating the building and arresting several people.</description>

      <body>Greek riot police have cleared the headquarters of the former state broadcaster ERT, using tear gas to gain entry and arresting several people. Police formed a cordon round the building in Athens, before going from room to room to evacuate protesters. Former employees have occupied the building since the government closed ERT and sacked its 2,600 staff in June. Greece's conservative-led coalition said the state broadcaster cost too much to run in an economic crisis. The closure of ERT prompted a left-wing party to withdraw from the governing coalition of prime minister Antonis Samaras in protest - a move which almost brought down the government. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Athens, says the question is whether the ERT debacle again fuels social unrest here - and how much stomach the Greeks still have for a fight. Following the announcement of ERT's closure in June, hundreds of staff refused to leave the building and continued to broadcast their programming via the internet. But early on Thursday, Greek police arrived to secure the building in Agia Paraskevi, a suburb in the north of Athens. Riot police used tear gas to disperse about 200 protesters outside the building, and then cleared each room inside. A member of staff inside the building told the BBC that once officers entered, it was fairly peaceful. Twenty or so workers were led out but three refused to go and were arrested. Police have now surrounded the building and protesters are gathering. The state-run Athens News Agency reported that Panagiotis Kalfagiannis, a journalist and head of the ERT employees' union, Pospert, was one of those held for public order offences. ERT was Greece's only TV broadcaster until the advent of private TV channels in 1989. Despite several major overhauls to keep up with fierce private competition, a fall in ERT's ratings in the mid-1990s triggered a long-running debate about its cost and efficiency. In June, as Greece attempted to satisfy international creditors that it was fulfilling its debt restructuring and bailout commitments, the prime minister, Antonis Samaras, announced the closure of ERT. He said the Greek exchequer could no longer afford to pay for a public broadcaster that cost more than $400,000 (£249,000) a year to run, and has refused to reinstate ERT unless it accepts a complete restructuring. An interim TV station, called Public TV or DT, has been broadcasting in Greece since July while a restructured public broadcaster, called Nerit, is not expected to begin operating before 2014. </body>

      <title>Musharraf freed from house arrest</title>
      <description>Pakistan frees former military ruler Pervez Musharraf from house arrest, days after he won bail in the last legal case against him, prison officials say.</description>

      <body>Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf has been released from house arrest and is free to move around the country, prison officials say. It comes days after he was bailed over the 2007 army operation to oust militants from Islamabad's Red Mosque - the last legal case against him. But the former general remains on a government exit control list and cannot leave the country. It is also unclear if he will leave the house because of threats to his life. Mr Musharraf's seven-month house arrest was unprecedented in a country which has been ruled by the military for more than half of its history. Speaking on Monday, his lawyer said Mr Musharraf had no intention of leaving Pakistan. He has consistently maintained that all the charges against him are politically motivated. Prison official Wajad Ali is quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that prison guards were withdrawn on Wednesday night from Mr Musharraf's villa on the outskirts of Islamabad. On Monday the court approved bail in the case on condition Mr Musharraf paid bonds totalling $2,000 (£1,243). The operation ordered by Mr Musharraf on the besieged Red Mosque left a cleric and more than 100 others dead, and fuelled a deadly militant insurgency inside Pakistan which rages to this day. Earlier this year, he returned to Pakistan from self-imposed exile to fight elections - which were won by Nawaz Sharif, the man he ousted in his 1999 coup - but swiftly ran into trouble. He was barred from running in the general election, and was placed under house arrest in April in the first of a series of cases relating to his time in power from 1999-2008. He faces murder trials over the assassination of former PM Benazir Bhutto and Baloch tribal leader Nawab Akbar Bugti. He has also been charged over his attempt to sack the higher judiciary in 2007 - he has been bailed in all three of those cases. Separately, the Sharif government said in June that it planned to try him for treason - but a formal complaint in that case has still to be lodged. </body>

      <title>Arafat 'may have been poisoned'</title>
      <description>Late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with radioactive polonium, says a Swiss forensic report obtained by al-Jazeera.</description>

      <body>The late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with radioactive polonium, says a Swiss forensic report obtained by al-Jazeera. Arafat's official medical records say he died in 2004 from a stroke resulting from a blood disorder. But his body was exhumed last year amid continuing claims he was murdered. The Swiss report said tests on the body showed "unexpected high activity" of polonium, which "moderately" supported the poisoning theory. Many Palestinians have long believed that Israel poisoned Arafat. There have also been allegations that he had Aids or cancer. Israel has consistently denied any involvement. A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said the Swiss investigation was "more soap opera than science". The scientists - from the Vaudois University Hospital Centre (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland - carried out a detailed examination of Arafat's medical records, samples taken from his remains and items he had taken into the hospital in Paris where he died in 2004. The biological materials included pieces of Mr Arafat's bones and soil samples from around his corpse. The scientists concluded that their results "moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210". The scientists stressed that they had been unable to reach a more definitive conclusion because of the time that had lapsed since Arafat's death, the limited samples available and the confused "chain of custody" of some of the specimens. Polonium-210 is a highly radioactive substance. It is found naturally in low doses in food and in the body, but can be fatal if ingested in high doses. The scientists have made "a pretty strong statement", according to Prof Paddy Regan, an expert in radiation detection and measurement at the University of Surrey in the UK, who was not involved in the investigation. "They are saying the hypothesis that Arafat was poisoned with polonium-210 is valid and has not been disproven by the data. However they cannot say definitively that he was murdered." Prof Regan says a series of assumptions would have been made in order to ascertain how much Po-210 may or may not have been in Mr Arafat's body at the time of his death. Po-210 has a short half-life of about 138 days. Prof Regan said measuring the tiny fraction left and extrapolating it back to the time of Arafat's death was like a blind man holding the tail of an elephant and using the information to work out the size of the animal. The second problem, he said, was that Po-210 occurs naturally in the environment. However, an indicator that the polonium may be synthetic is if there was far less Pb-210 (lead-210) in the samples. The professor highlighted results from two samples - the shroud under the corpse of Mr Arafat and urine samples taken from his underwear - both showed high levels of Po-210 compared to Pb-210, possibly suggesting the presence of "additional" synthetic polonium. He noted however that most of the samples of polonium measured in the report were accompanied by activities from Pb-210. Parallel investigations are being carried out by French and Russian experts - one Russian official said last month that no traces of polonium had been found. Yigal Palmor of Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC: "This is more soap opera than science." He said the investigations had been commissioned by "interested parties" - Mr Arafat's widow and the Palestinian Authority - and had "never bothered" to look for some key data. "The other huge hole in the theory is the absence of all access to the French hospital where Arafat died and to Arafat's medical files," said Mr Palmor. "How can the cause of death be determined without the opinion of the doctors or the results of the medical tests they ran on the patient? "Israel doesn't feel concerned in the least." Speaking in Paris, Arafat's widow, Suha, said the Swiss results revealed "a real crime, a political assassination". "This has confirmed all our doubts. It is scientifically proved that he didn't die a natural death and we have scientific proof that this man was killed." Reuters said she did not name any suspects and acknowledged that her husband had had many enemies in his lifetime. Arafat, who led the Palestine Liberation Organisation for 35 years and became the first president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996, fell violently ill in October 2004 at his compound. Two weeks later he was flown to a French military hospital in Paris, where he died on 11 November 2004, aged 75. France began a murder inquiry in August 2012 after the Lausanne scientists, working with an al-Jazeera documentary crew, found traces of polonium-210 on Arafat's personal effects. His widow had objected to a post-mortem at the time of his death, but asked the Palestinian Authority to permit the exhumation "to reveal the truth". His remains were removed from his tomb in the West Bank city of Ramallah in November 2012 and reinterred the same day. Last month, the head of the Russian Federal Medico-Biological Agency, Vladimir Uiba, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Arafat "could not have been poisoned with polonium", saying that test carried out by Russian experts "found no traces of this substance". However, the agency later denied that Mr Uiba had made any official statement on the findings. The head of the Palestinian investigation team, Tawfiq Tirawi, confirmed on Tuesday that the Russian and Swiss reports had been delivered. The Palestinian team is reported to have handed over its findings on Saturday. </body>

      <body>Authorities in the Philippines are bracing for the arrival of Typhoon Haiyan, which is expected to strike central parts of the country on Friday. Haiyan, a category five storm, is moving towards the South East Asian nation with winds of up to 278 km/h (173mph). Some schools have already been closed and evacuations are under way in some areas. Ferry operations have been suspended and fishing boats ordered back to port. Typhoon Haiyan is expected to make landfall around noon on Friday between the islands of Samar and Leyte. It is predicted to hit central areas already struggling to recover from a 7.3-magnitude earthquake last month, including the worst-hit island of Bohol. Around 5,000 people are still living in tents in Bohol after losing their homes in the quake. Meteorologists in the Philippines warned that Haiyan could be as devastating as Typhoon Botha in 2012. Botha devastated parts of the southern Philippines, leaving at least 1,000 people dead and causing more than $1bn (£620m) in damage. "This is a very dangerous typhoon, local officials know where the vulnerable areas are and have given instructions on evacuations," state weather forecaster Glaiza Escullar told AFP. "There are not too many mountains on its path to deflect the force of impact, making it more dangerous." Haiyan is the 25th typhoon to enter Philippines territory this year. </body>

      <title>NZ probe over 'teen rape club'</title>
      <description>New Zealand's government orders a probe into police handling of an investigation into an alleged teen rape club that PM John Key has called "abhorrent".</description>

      <body>New Zealand's government has ordered a probe into police handling of an investigation into a group of teenagers who allegedly raped underage girls. The male teenagers called themselves the Roast Busters and reportedly got young girls drunk, had sex with them, and posted their exploits online. Police initially said they investigated the group for two years, but could not prosecute without a formal complaint. However, it since emerged that a girl had made a formal complaint in 2011. Three other alleged victims had also spoken to the police since 2011, reports said. Prime Minister John Key criticised police handling case, describing it as "disappointing", and "frankly, not good enough". "This is a very serious issue. Parents around New Zealand will want to know that in the event their daughters make a complaint to police it's taken seriously, and actually, we're entitled to know all of the facts up front," he said. Police Minister Anne Tolley said she had asked the Independent Police Conduct Authority to review how the police had handled the case. Both she and the police commissioner had "learnt more about the case through the media than police", she said. The alleged victim, who is now 15 years old, told New Zealand broadcaster 3News on Wednesday that she had made a complaint in 2011. "They said that I didn't have enough evidence to show, because I went out in clothes that was pretty much asking for it," the girl said. She added that she had given evidence in a video interview as part of her complaint. The local district police commander, Bill Searle, said there had been "miscommunication". "I was briefed that there were no complaints," he said. "But when I saw the footage on TV, to me that was a formal complaint. That's when I made the decision that it was to be classed as a formal complaint. He apologised to the girl, and said that since the case of the Roast Busters was revealed by media this week, two members of the Auckland-based group had spoken to the police. Based on their interviews, police had executed a search warrant on one address and "seized some evidence" that could help the investigation, he added. </body>

      <body>Amnesty International has accused major oil companies, including Shell, of failing to report the true picture of oil spills in Nigeria. Amnesty says oil companies often blame oil spills on sabotage in order to get out of paying compensation when in fact corroded pipes are the cause. The report says the process of cleaning up the oil spills is completely discredited. Shell said it "firmly rejects unsubstantiated assertions". It highlighted the issue of theft of crude oil, which it said "remains the main cause of oil pollution in the Delta". Oil spills are having an appalling environmental impact on the Niger Delta and they are happening at an alarming rate, says the BBC's Will Ross in Lagos. Amnesty identifies a "staggering" 474 spills in 2012 in one area alone, operated by the Nigerian Agip Oil Company - a subsidiary of Italian firm ENI. Working with a local human rights group, Amnesty studied the oil spill investigation process in Nigeria over six months. It claims there is "no legitimate basis" for the oil companies' claims that the vast majority of spills are caused by sabotage and theft. Members of the local community together with oil company staff and government officials are supposed to investigate oil spills, but Amnesty calls this Joint Investigation Visit (JIV) process "wholly unreliable" because, it says, the companies themselves are the primary investigators and the process lacks transparency. It says this means that both the causes and severity of oil spills may therefore be misrecorded, sometimes meaning affected communities miss out on compensation. "Sabotage and theft of oil are serious problems in the Niger Delta," the report acknowledges. "However, international oil companies are overstating the case in an effort to deflect attention away from the many oil spills that are due to corrosion and equipment failure. Moreover, securing oil infrastructure against such acts is - to a substantial extent - the responsibility of the operator." It says the majority of the report's findings relate to Shell as the primary operator in the Niger Delta - though it acknowledges improvements to Shell's JIV process since 2011. It also points out that Nigerian Agip suffered more than double the number of spills as Shell, though it operates over a smaller area. Shell said it "firmly rejects" the claims. "We seek to bring greater transparency and independent oversight to the issue of oil spills, and will continue to find ways to enhance this." It said the JIV process was a federal process the company could not unilaterally change. Stolen oil, Shell said, costs Nigeria billions of dollars in lost revenue. "Co-ordinated action from the industry, government, security forces, civil society and others is needed to end this criminality, which remains the main cause of oil pollution in the Delta today," Shell said. It said it regretted "that some NGOs continue to take a campaigning approach rather than focusing on on-the-ground solutions that bring societal benefits". </body>

      <body>Tajikistan's President Imomali Rakhmon has won another seven-year term in office, electoral officials say. They say he secured 83.6% of the vote in Wednesday's elections. Turnout was nearly 87%. The president faced five challengers but the only genuine opposition candidate was barred from standing. Rakhmon, 61, did not campaign actively. The authoritarian leader has been in office for more than 20 years in the impoverished former Soviet republic. The EU and the US have not recognised a single election in the Central Asian country as free and fair. Instead of campaigning, the president relied on extensive media coverage of his visits around the country, which his opponents say was heavily biased in his favour. The opposition accuses Mr Rakhmon - whose huge billboards are seen everywhere in the capital Dushanbe and other towns - of developing a personality cult. He denies the claim. The five other presidential candidates have refrained from publicly criticising Mr Rakhmon. Human rights activists Oynihol Bobonazarova - widely seen as the only genuine opposition candidate - was banned from the polls. The electoral commission said earlier she had failed to collect the necessary 210,000 signatures of eligible voters to be officially registered. Despite the easy victory, critics say Mr Rakhmon will face rising social tension in the country where some 50% of the population live in poverty. Almost half of the nation's GDP is earned by more than one million Tajik migrants working abroad, especially in Russia, Analysts say Tajikistan could also face further security challenges from Islamist groups in neighbouring Afghanistan after the planned pullout of the US-led forces next year. Tajikistan was devastated by the 1992-97 civil war between the Moscow-backed government and the Islamist-led opposition. Up to 50,000 were killed before the conflict ended with a UN-brokered peace agreement. </body>

      <body>The only known copy of a will made by the former emperor of France, Napoleon, is to be auctioned later in Paris. Dozens of people have visited the auction house to see the last testament of the general who died in exile. The will was written 19 days before his death on St Helena island in 1821. The original document is in France's national archives. But the copy, written by a close adviser, is described as "very special" by Pierre Gheno, an expert on Napoleon. It is expected to fetch 120,000 euros ($162,000). "We get access to Napoleon's intimacy," said auctioneer Christophe Castandet. "He makes decisions on who will get his jewellery, and who will get his gold, his garments, we are just a few days before his death, in the intimacy of the man who turned Europe upside down," continued Mr Castandet. The will gives details of Napoleon's six years of captivity on St Helena at the hands of the British following his defeat at Waterloo in 1815. The once-feared general, who conquered half of Europe, had nothing more than a few jewels, sculptures, porcelain crockery and the odd painting at the time of his death. In the document, Napoleon requested that his ashes be scattered along the river Seine - a wish, which historians say, was denied by the then king of France. It was not until 19 years after his death that Napoleon was returned to mainland France and interred in the Invalides monument in Paris. </body>

      <body>The Kristall Sauna-Wellness Park hotel has apologised for promoting a "romantic Kristall Nacht evening" for spa-lovers on the 75th anniversary of Kristallnacht - Night of Broken Glass - when Nazis attacked Jewish homes and businesses, it's reported. Social media users condemned and parodied the online advert until the hotel in Bad Klosterlausnitz, Thuringia, removed the advert and made its apologies via Facebook, Der Spiegel magazine reports. The hotel owners say they often include the name Kristall in promotions, but acknowledge that this time it was "insensitive and extremely inappropriate". The event is now simply called a "long romantic night". Overnight on 9/10 November 1938, at least 91 Jews were killed and tens of thousands were arrested while Nazi mobs burned down synagogues, businesses and homes. Kristallnacht was the first wave of organised violence against Jews across Nazi Germany. Social media comment included references to the spa hotel being a "Heil Bad" - literally a curative spa, but playing on the "Heil Hitler" greeting.

      <description>Moderate Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie wins a landslide re-election, as Democrats seize New York city hall and the Virginia governorship.</description>

      <body>Moderate Republican New Jersey Governor Chris Christie has won a landslide re-election, a possible launch pad for a 2016 White House run. In Virginia, Terry McAuliffe - a key Hillary Clinton ally - narrowly beat a Republican to become governor of the pivotal presidential swing state. Bill de Blasio's thumping victory in New York makes him the city's first Democratic mayor-elect in two decades. Tuesday's results point the way to next year's US midterm elections. New Jersey's straight-talking Governor Christie brushed aside his Democratic challenger, state senator Barbara Buono, by 60.5% to 38%, retaining a handy platform for a potential presidential bid. His ability to attract the support of Democrats, independents and minorities makes him a tantalising prospect for the ideologically split Republican party ahead of 2016. "We stand here tonight showing that it is possible to put doing your job first," said Mr Christie in his victory speech, "to put working together first, to fight for what you believe in yet still stand by your principles and get something done for the people who elected you." The governor, known for his readiness to work with Democrats in a left-leaning state, won much praise for his handling of the carnage wrought on the region by super-storm Sandy one year ago. However, fellow Republicans at a national level lambasted him for his embrace of Democratic President Barack Obama as he visited Jersey Shore to see the devastation. In the Virginia governor's race, Mr McAuliffe eked out a smaller-than-expected, 48% to 45.5% win against socially conservative Republican Ken Cuccinelli. "Over the next four years most Democrats and Republicans want to make Virginia a model of pragmatic leadership," said Mr McAuliffe, a Democrat taking charge in a state with a Republican-led legislature. "This is only possible if Virginia is the model for bipartisan co-operation." During the campaign, Mr McAuliffe had emphasised his opponent's tea party support. The hardline wing of the Republican party was widely blamed for last month's government shutdown, which temporarily laid off many of the federal workers who populate Virginia's suburbs. Mr Cuccinelli, the state's outgoing attorney general, had stressed his Democratic rival's championing of the Obama healthcare law, whose troubled rollout has been a White House public relations disaster. A Libertarian candidate who won nearly 7% of Virginia's vote may have cost the Republican the race, say analysts. Mr Cuccinelli was also vastly outspent by his Democratic opponent. Mr McAuliffe is a veteran Democratic party fundraiser who was chairman of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. His capture of the governor's mansion in a crucial presidential swing-voting state could help plot a road map to victory for her should she run again for the White House, say analysts. Meanwhile, Mr de Blasio will succeed New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg to become the first Democratic mayor of America's largest city since 1993. He secured a whopping 73% of the vote, compared with 24% for his Republican rival, Joe Lhota. In his victory speech, Mr de Blasio said the result showed that America's largest city had chosen "a progressive path", and he promised to make fighting income inequality his top priority. In other elections across the US on Tuesday: Tuesday's off-year polls could be seen as a litmus test of the parties' support ahead of the 2014 midterm elections. Next year's votes will decide the make-up of the House of Representatives, one-third of the Senate, and governorships in more than half the states. Mr Obama's Democratic party controls the US Senate, while Republicans hold sway in the House of Representatives. Now in his second term, Mr Obama will vacate the presidency in 2017. Joseph Lhota (Republican): 24% - Bill de Blasio (Democrat): 73% Chris Christie (Republican): 60.5% - Barbara Buono (Democrat): 38% Ken Cuccinelli (Republican): 45.5% - Terry McAuliffe (Democrat): 48% </body>

      <body>Toronto's mayor has faced angry protesters - and mounting calls to quit - as he arrived for work a day after he admitted smoking crack cocaine. One of Mayor Rob Ford's veteran policy aides resigned on Wednesday, the latest in a string of defections since May. Meanwhile, even Mr Ford's allies on the city council say they have lost confidence in him. Officials in Canada's largest city cannot legally remove Mr Ford unless he is convicted of a crime. More than 200 chanting demonstrators were gathered outside city hall as Mr Ford arrived for work shortly after midday on Wednesday. He entered his office via a back stairway. City Councillor James Pasternak says he and several colleagues are asking Deputy Mayor Norm Kelly to approach Mr Ford again about resigning, in the hopes of a "dignified exit". Another councillor, Janet Davis, said the mayor had "stubbornly refused to listen to everyone across the city to step down". "The mayor has got to come to the conclusion himself that he has to step down," she said on Wednesday. Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne has expressed concern about Mr Ford's personal issues, but she stopped short of calling on him to stand aside. City Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, who serves on Mr Ford's executive council, is proposing a motion asking Mr Ford to take a leave of absence. He says he knows it is a symbolic move, but "the right thing to do is for council to take a clear position". "I remain concerned that there's more information that's going to come out," he told reporters. "I'm troubled by that and that it will hurt this city even further." On Wednesday, Canadian media reported that Brooks Barnett, a Ford police advisor, was no longer on the mayor's staff. Mr Ford's office did not offer details other than to confirm Mr Barnett's departure. In his public apology on Tuesday, Mr Ford said he was "embarrassed" by his behaviour, but vowed to run for re-election. "Folks, I have nothing left to hide," he said. "I would do anything, absolutely anything to change the past, but the past is the past and we must move forward." The mayor has not been charged, but city police chief Bill Blair has said authorities are in possession of a video which apparently shows Mr Ford smoking crack. Mr Blair has also said police are in possession of a second clip, but will not describe its contents. The allegations of drug use first surfaced in May when journalists with the gossip website Gawker and the Toronto Star reported seeing the footage. It is unclear when the video of Mr Ford - described by the Toronto Star as "clearly impaired" and "incoherent and rambling" before smoking from the pipe - was shot. But it was recorded with a phone camera, suggesting it could not be more than a few years old. And in it Mr Ford expresses his distaste for Justin Trudeau, a young parliamentarian elevated to Liberal Party leader less than a month before reports of the video surfaced. Just over 1% of all Canadians 15 years or older used crack cocaine in the past year, according to a Health Canada survey quoted by broadcaster CBC. But 80% of cocaine users said it would be "easy or very easy to get" the drug. </body>

      <title>Key accord at Colombia peace talks</title>
      <description>Colombian Farc rebel leaders and government negotiators agree on a political future for the left-wing group should a peace deal be reached at talks in Cuba.</description>

      <body>Colombian Farc rebel leaders and government negotiators have agreed on a political future for the left-wing group should a peace deal be reached. At the ongoing talks in Cuba, both sides agreed on guarantees, conditions and support for the creation of new political parties. Colombia's largest rebel group and the government are yet to discuss another four items on the agenda. The peace talks aim to end nearly 50 years of armed conflict. Some 220,000 people have died in the violence, according to a study by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory. Hundreds of thousands have been displaced. Wednesday's announcement was made in the Cuban capital, Havana, where the Colombian government and the rebels have held negotiating sessions since last November. Colombia's chief government negotiator said it would provide a "new democratic opening". "Never again politics and weapons together," Humberto de la Calle said. Farc leader Ivan Marquez called it "an important step in the right direction to end the conflict and to achieve a real democracy in Colombia". The peace agenda has six major points: land reform, political participation, disarmament, illicit drugs, rights of the victims and peace deal implementation. They had already partially agreed on land reform. The rebels' political participation is widely considered to be one of the thorniest issues on the agenda so this latest announcement will give the process a much-needed boost, says the BBC's Arturo Wallace in Bogota. There are still important details to be clarified, including the key question of whether some members of Farc can be barred from participating in politics because of human rights abuses or crimes against humanity. But this is something that will be addressed in the near future, when the parties start discussing the reparation of the victims of the conflict, our correspondent says. The government estimates there are just 7,800 active Farc rebels, with approximately another 10,000 people on the margins of the group. </body>

      <title>US hijacker returns from Cuba</title>
      <description>William Potts, who hijacked an American airliner in 1984 and forced it to take him to Cuba, has returned to the US.</description>

      <body>An American man who hijacked a plane in 1984 and forced it to fly to Cuba has returned to the US. The FBI said William Potts was taken into custody shortly after his charter flight landed in Miami on Wednesday. Potts, now 56, commandeered a commercial flight from New Jersey to Florida with 56 passengers aboard. He was a member of the militant African-American Black Panther movement and expected the Cuban government to give him guerrilla training. Instead, Cuba imprisoned him for 13 years for piracy. He later settled in Havana but was keen to return to the US. Before he left Havana, he said he was seeking "closure" by facing the US justice system, which he hopes will be lenient. "I'm ready for whatever. My position is, of course, I did the crime and I did the time, and the United States has to recognise that," he told the Associated Press news agency. Potts had been in contact with US diplomats in Havana, who, he said, had told him that he could leave on a charter flight to Miami on Wednesday. He expected to be handed over to US marshals upon his arrival in Florida. "What happens after that I couldn't tell you," he said. Potts was taken from the airport to an FBI office in Miami and is scheduled to make his first appearance in a US court on Thursday. In the 1960s and early 1970s, dozens of US planes were hijacked to Cuba as the Cold War with then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro intensified. But by the 1980s such incidents had become less frequent and Cuba swiftly convicted Potts. US officials have aggressively prosecuted some of the returning hijackers but gave significant sentence reductions to others who served time in other countries and pleaded guilty. After his release Potts remained in Havana, where he married and had two daughters. His daughters now live in the United States and Potts has sought for a number of years to return to his homeland. "Having completed my sentence, I feel like I want to put all that stuff behind me. I don't want that lingering over or impeding anything I might want to do. Once you've paid your debt to society, you're entitled to a fresh start," he said last month. But Potts says he does not intend to settle in the US: "Just as soon as I finish taking care of this business in the United States, I certainly have every intention of returning to Cuba to live." </body>

      <body>Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) killed the two French journalists who were abducted in Kidal in north Mali, a website used by the group has said. An AQIM statement said the killings on Saturday were in response to France's "new crusade", Sahara Media reports. French troops drove Islamist groups out of northern Mali's main towns after launching an offensive in January. France described the killing of Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon as a "calculated assassination". AQIM said their killing was intended to avenge "crimes" committed by French and African troops against the people of northern Mali, Sahara Media, a news agency based in Mauritania, reported on its Arab-language website. "The organisation considers that this is the least price that President Francois Hollande and his people will pay for their new crusade," AQIM's statement said. Ms Dupont, 57, and Mr Verlon, 58, worked for Radio France International (RFI). They were kidnapped and shot dead on Saturday after interviewing a local leader in the northern town of Kidal. There are 200 French troops and 200 African peacekeepers as well as a Malian army base in Kidal. The bodies of the journalists have been repatriated to France. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius has said operations are ongoing to find their attackers. On Monday, Malian police officials said a number of suspects had been arrested in connection with the murders. The French government could not confirm than anyone had been detained. </body>

      <body>South Africa's governing African National Congress party has criticised a school for displaying students' artwork which "borders on racism". The exhibition included images of ANC leaders, including President Jacob Zuma and Nelson Mandela, printed on T-shirts as part of an end-of-year art exam. The ANC said they ridiculed its leaders with one labelling them "fakers since 1994", when white minority rule ended. But the school in Durban denied there was any racial motivation behind them. Headmaster Trevor Hall said Westville Boys's High School in Durban was committed to a "non-racial democratic South Africa" and apologised for any offence caused by the T-shirt images. The visual art syllabus included a section on social and political commentary, he said. One of the satirical T-shirts has a picture of Mr Zuma posing as the Bakers man - the emblem of Bakers Biscuits - with the word "Fakers" over his head. Senzo Mkhize, the ANC's spokesman in KwaZulu-Natal, said such captions were "derogatory". "It is unacceptable for a school's management to allow individuals with their own agendas to ridicule and insult the leadership of the country in this manner," he said in a statement. He said the party was made aware of the T-shirts by a member of the public who saw them displayed at a local shopping mall in Durban. "We view this as an attack on the ANC and on the country since the South African flag [is] featured in the background," Mr Mkhize said, calling on the school to investigate the incident and sanction those behind the designs. "We cannot allow people who are hell-bent on employing underhand tactics to fuel hatred that reminds us of the dark days of apartheid." But Mr Hall told South Africa's Daily News paper that "no particular political or social bias is encouraged" during the course. "Pupils are free to make their own commentary on society, as is their right," he is quoted as saying. It is not the first time artwork has angered the ANC. Last year, the governing party demanded that a controversial painting of President Zuma with his genitals exposed be removed from public view. The artwork caused a furore with some saying President Zuma's right to dignity had been violated, while supporters said it was a question of freedom of expression. The ANC dropped legal action after the gallery agreed to remove the painting, which was vandalised whilst on display. </body>

      <body>An Indian MP and his estranged wife being investigated for a murder of a servant have been accused of torturing a second maid, police said. On Wednesday, the couple were remanded in custody after a servant working at their home died of severe injuries. Police say that Jagriti Singh, the wife of Dhananjay Singh, an MP from Uttar Pradesh, is the main murder suspect. The MP has denied involvement in her death. There has been no word from his wife. He said that he was instigating divorce proceedings against his wife. News channels have reported that servants at the MP's house often complained of being beaten with sticks and of being kept locked inside. Police said a second servant, who had been working at the MP's house since last November, had been admitted to a hospital with injuries. Officers found her at the house of Mr Singh's brother-in-law, an unnamed police official told the Press Trust of India. "She was also beaten up in an inhuman manner and and she cannot even sit," the officer said. Police said the servant was being treated at a local hospital. The cases comes months after a teenage Indian maid was rescued from an upmarket Delhi home by police and social rights campaigners. She said that she had been attacked with knives and mauled by dogs. Her employer, an executive for a multinational company, is now facing charges of assault and illegal confinement. In another case in April 2012, police arrested a wealthy couple, both doctors, who allegedly locked up their 13-year-old help while they went away on holiday. She was rescued by fire fighters when neighbours spotted her crying on an outside balcony. </body>

Foreign banks will now be allowed to set up "wholly owned subsidiaries" in India, which will enable them to open branches anywhere in the country. The subsidiaries will need a minimum capital of 5bn rupees ($80m; £50m). The changes are a part of the push by the central bank's new governor, Raghuram Rajan, to liberalise the sector as he looks to boost growth. Foreign banks have long wanted to boost their presence in the country - home to nearly 1.2 billion people. However so far they have had to face tight regulations, especially over the number of branches they can open. The Reserve Bank of India said the new rules would allow them to open branches "at par with Indian banks". However, they will need permission to open branches in "certain locations that are sensitive from the perspective of national security". The RBI said it would also consider introducing takeover rules that would allow foreign companies to own as much as 74% of a domestic bank. But it said any such decision will be taken after a review relating to "the extent of penetration of foreign investment in Indian banks and functioning of foreign banks". </body>

      <title>Berlusconi family 'like WWII Jews'</title>
      <description>Former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi says persecution by the judiciary has made his children feel "like the Jews under Hitler".</description>

      <body>The former Italian Prime Minister, Silvio Berlusconi, has said his children "feel like the families of Jews... under Hitler's regime". In an interview for Italian television, Berlusconi, who claims he is being hounded by the judiciary, said "the whole world is against us". In August he was convicted for tax fraud and is facing further allegations and the loss of his parliamentary seat. Jewish groups described his comments as inappropriate and incomprehensible. Renzo Gettegna, of the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, said they were "offensive to the memory of those deprived of every right and, after atrocities and unutterable suffering, their lives". Nichi Vendola of the head of the Left, Ecology, Freedom (SEL) party tweeted: "To trivialise a terrible tragedy such as the Shoah for an everyday political polemic as Berlusconi has done is chilling." Berlusconi is no stranger to controversy. He is reported to have said that "Mussolini never killed anyone. Mussolini used to send people on vacation in internal exile." And he once compared the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schulz, to a Nazi prison guard, and described US President Barack Obama as "suntanned". Berlusconi blames his long history of legal woes on left-wing magistrates who, he says, are determined to ensure his political demise. He insists he is innocent. In an angry video message broadcast after his prison sentence for tax fraud was upheld by Italy's highest court, Berlusconi said he had been the victim of "judicial harassment that is unmatched in the civilised world". In 2009, after his immunity from prosecution was lifted, he declared: "I am without doubt the person who's been the most persecuted in the entire history of the world and the history of man." Later this month, Italy's Senate will vote on whether Berlusconi - who has also been barred from holding public office for two years - should be stripped of his seat under a law banning convicted criminals from parliament. Correspondents say if he is banned it could open up the risk of arrest in other criminal cases. </body>

      <description>Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin describes having acid thrown in his face at the trial of a dancer accused of ordering the attack.</description>

      <body>The artistic director of Russia's Bolshoi ballet has described having acid thrown in his face during the trial of a dancer accused of ordering the attack. Sergei Filin, who suffered severe burns to his face and damage to his sight, spoke of a "terrifying pain". Pavel Dmitrichenko has denied arranging the assault in a case that revealed bitter infighting at the Bolshoi. Two other men are being tried with him over the attack in January. Mr Filin, 43, began his testimony on Wednesday by saying he was fair and transparent in distributing roles. But he said that Mr Dmitrichenko, 29, kept trying to find compromising material on him. He described the night of the assault, and how his attacker said "Here's a greeting for you" as he threw sulphuric acid in his face. "Suddenly I felt liquid, I felt a sudden pain, I had never experienced such pain," he said. "Terrifying pain, my eyes couldn't see." Mr Filin's highly anticipated court appearance came despite doctors' orders for him to avoid stress, according to AFP news agency. Prosecutors say Mr Dmitrichenko colluded with ex-convict Yuri Zarutsky, who has admitted throwing the acid at the ballet chief outside his home. Mr Zarutsky insists he acted alone. A third defendant, Andrei Lipatov, who is accused of driving the car used to transport the alleged attacker, has denied any part in the attack. If convicted, the three accused could be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison. Mr Dmitrichenko has been in custody since his arrest in March. Meanwhile, Mr Filin has undergone more than 20 operations on his eyes since the attack. Doctors in Germany have managed to partially restore his sight, but he will reportedly need further treatment. He was once star of Russia's renowned Bolshoi theatre, and in 2011 became the artistic director of the ballet troupe. The acid attack exposed vicious internal rivalries which eventually caused the dismissal of Bolshoi director Anatoly Iksanov. </body>

      <title>Deadly blast hits central Damascus</title>
      <description>Eight people are killed by am explosion blast in the Syrian capital Damascus, and another eight in a blast in the Druze town of Suweida, reports say.</description>

      <body>Eight people have been killed in a blast in the centre of the Syrian capital, Damascus, the Sana state news agency reports. It said 50 were also wounded in the Hijaz Square explosion, which hit the offices of the railway company. Eight people were also killed by a rare blast in the town of Suweida, home to Syria's Druze minority, say reports. Suweida has remained under government control through the conflict, and had so far been largely free of violence. Wednesday's blast there went off outside the headquarters of the Air Force Intelligence, the most feared security service in Syria. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group, said it had been a suicide car bomb and that the intelligence branch chief was among those killed. Sana blamed the attack on "terrorists", the government's way of referring to rebels forces. Syria's Druze minority - adherents of an offshoot of Shia Islam - numbers about 700,000. Its main leadership has so far stayed out of the conflict publicly. The Observatory said were conflicting reports about whether the Damascus explosion had been caused by a bomb or a mortar shell. No group has said it was behind the blast but Sana again quoted police sources blaming "terrorists. Last month, an explosion near Damascus airport cut off power to large parts of Syria. The attacks come a day after the latest round of international diplomacy failed to fix a date for a long-delayed peace conference on the Syrian conflict. The UN-Arab League envoy on Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, had hoped to hold the conference in Geneva this month. But he said he was not able to announce a date, despite a day of meetings first with senior diplomats from the US and Russia, then with the other permanent members of the UN Security Council - the UK, France and China - as well as Syria's neighbours Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan and Turkey. Mr Brahimi said he was still "striving" for a summit by the end of the year. Attempts to set up a conference have been going on for months amid disputes over who should attend and its agenda. The Syrian opposition has insisted President Bashar al-Assad should resign before any talks can take begin, but the government has rejected this. The US and Russia disagree on whether Syria's key regional neighbour Iran should be present. The idea of a conference was first mooted in May, and in September UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon announced a tentative date of mid-November after the Security Council passed a binding resolution on Syrian chemical weapons. On Wednesday, Russia's Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov was quoted as saying that Moscow was ready to host "informal" talks between President Assad and the Syrian opposition to begin the peace process. Mr Bogdanov, who was involved in the talks with Mr Brahimi, said such a meeting would help to create "a favourable atmosphere, so that people can meet and discuss existing issues", Russian media quoted him as saying. Meanwhile, aid agencies have warned that more than nine million Syrians, almost half the population, are now in need of humanitarian relief. The UN estimates that more than two million people have fled Syria since the unrest began in March 2011, resulting in a humanitarian crisis. Most have sought refuge in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. More than 100,000 people are estimated to have been killed since the conflict began. </body>

      <title>Kerry confident of Mid-East progress</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry says he remains optimistic that tensions and difficulties can be overcome in the Middle East peace process.</description>

      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry says he remains optimistic that tensions and difficulties can be overcome in the Middle East peace process. Any negotiations have "moments of up and moments of down", he said after holding separate talks with the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships. Mr Kerry reaffirmed Washington's rejection of Israeli settlement activity as "illegitimate". The direct talks launched in July have shown little sign of progress. Mr Kerry said: "We need the space to negotiate privately, secretly, quietly and we will continue to do that. "We have six months ahead of us on the timetable we have set for ourselves and I am confident we have the ability to make progress." Mr Kerry said he had had a "very, very good meeting" with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. This time there has been rising Palestinian anger at a perceived acquiescence to Israeli settlements as part of a deal to returning to talks. "I want to make it extremely clear that at no time did the Palestinians in any way agree, as a matter of going back to the talks, that they could somehow condone or accept the settlements," Mr Kerry said. A previous round of negotiations collapsed in September 2010 in a bitter row over Israeli settlements. After separate talks with Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli Prime Minister said Israel stood by the terms agreed for the talks. "I'm concerned about their progress because I see the Palestinians continuing with incitement, continuing to create artificial crises, continuing to avoid, run away from the historic decisions that are needed to make a genuine peace," he said. On Tuesday, some Israeli media reported that Israeli negotiators had told their Palestinian counterparts that the barrier built by Israel in and around the occupied West Bank should serve as the border of a future Palestinian state. And on Sunday, the Maariv newspaper carried a report saying Israel would build a security fence in the Jordan Valley, along the border with Jordan - a claim denounced by the Palestinians. Mr Abbas also told a meeting of his Fatah movement that the negotiations with Israel had not made any progress so far, according to the Maan news agency. For his part, Mr Kerry told the Israeli prime minister that, despite such reports, he was confident a deal could be reached. Mr Kerry is pursuing an agreement based on a "two-state solution" that envisages Israel and a Palestinian state - consisting of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip - existing alongside each other. He has previously said that all "final-status" issues - Jerusalem, borders, security arrangements, Jewish settlements and Palestinian refugees - are on the table. The negotiating sessions have been held in secret locations and at undisclosed times as part of a US-requested media blackout. But both sides have voiced frustration at a lack of progress on core issues. The secretary of state has denied media speculation that he may propose a new interim peace deal. Mr Netanyahu wants Palestinian recognition of Israel as a Jewish state as a priority, whereas the Palestinians say borders and security top their agenda. The Palestinians want their state to include all land captured by Israel in 1967, but some 500,000 Jews now live in more than 200 settlements and outposts in the West Bank including East Jerusalem. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. However, Mr Netanyahu has rejected any return to the pre-1967 ceasefire lines as "indefensible", saying it would not take into account the "demographic changes on the ground". Mutually-agreed land swaps have been discussed in previous talks as a way to overcome this problem. </body>

      <title>UK spy chiefs to be quizzed by MPs</title>

      <body>The heads of the UK's spying agencies are to face an unprecedented televised grilling by MPs. GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, MI5 director general Andrew Parker and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers will be quizzed by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in public at 14:00 GMT. Intelligence chiefs have given evidence in private for many years. The questioning follows leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden which raised concerns about spying. Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought sanctuary from the US - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. Leaks also suggested its American counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA), had bugged the phone calls of several world leaders. The ISC - chaired by former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind - has already carried out a limited investigation into claims that GCHQ used the NSA's vast Prism programme, which gathers information from internet companies, to circumvent UK laws. Although the committee cleared the agency of any wrongdoing in the 197 specific intelligence reports it looked at, it is now undertaking a wider inquiry into whether the laws governing surveillance are adequate for the internet age. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web, has said encryption cracking by UK and US spy agencies is "appalling and foolish". Intelligence chiefs are expected to be asked about Mr Snowden, as well as subjects including terrorist threats and cybersecurity. Subjects off limits will include details of intelligence techniques and ongoing operations. Mr Parker took over as head of the security service MI5 earlier this year. MI6 is charged with gathering intelligence and GCHQ with monitoring communications. The session is expected to last an hour and a half. It will be shown on the BBC News Channel, with a short time delay to prevent anything being broadcast that might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies. The ISC, made up of senior MPs and peers, said the meeting would "give an insight into the world of intelligence and the work the agencies do on behalf of the UK". The committee said the move was "a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies". </body>

      <title>BAE workers digest job cuts news</title>
      <description>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24847413</url>

      <body>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy. They were sent home on Wednesday after the announcement of job cuts, which include about 800 in Scotland. Most of the jobs will go in Portsmouth where shipbuilding will end altogether. There will also be job losses in Filton, near Bristol. Unions at Scotland's shipyards said they hoped many of the job losses would be found through voluntary redundancy. The Scottish yards include Govan and Scotstoun, on the River Clyde in Glasgow, and Rosyth in Fife. The Clyde yards have been earmarked for building the new Type 26 warships. The UK government has been accused by MPs in the south-east of England of sacrificing shipbuilding in Portsmouth because of next year's independence referendum. However, the Scottish government has accused it of "absurd" threat to jobs in Glasgow in the event of a Yes vote. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that in the event of independence, a UK government would be bound to want to build warships inside the UK and not in Scotland. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said Scotland would find it "difficult" to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country voted for independence. But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that in an independent Scotland, joint procurement of Type 26 frigates could be possible. She said: "These ships will be built on the Clyde because BAE said yesterday, and the defence secretary said yesterday, that it's the best place to build them because of the investment we have seen in these yards, because of the skills mix and because of the value for money. "Type 26 frigates, offshore patrol vessels - these are exactly the kind of vessels that an independent Scottish government would need. So we would be procuring some of these Type 26 frigates. "Actually, the sensible proposition in that scenario would be a joint procurement." However, former Conservative Defence Minister Sir Gerald Howarth told the programme the issue was about European law. He said: "Under article 346, national security determines that if we wish to maintain exclusivity in the United Kingdom in order to maintain our sovereign capability, then we can do so. "If Scotland were no longer part of the United Kingdom, then Scotland would not enjoy that same privilege which they enjoy today. "Nor would the United Kingdom enjoy that same exemption." The defence contractor and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have announced measures which they hope will offset the effect of the job cuts. Among the plans are more than £100m of investment to expand the dockyard at Portsmouth. Three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal Navy will also be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. This could help sustain shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 Global Combat ships. BAE said it had agreed with the MoD "that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships". "The company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy," it said. It said the cost of this restructuring would be borne by the MoD. BAE said it would now begin consultation to cut 1,775 jobs "to result from these restructuring proposals". The MoD confirmed that it would commission three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels to play "a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti smuggling operations". It said these would be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards. Work on the new vessels is due to begin next year with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017. The ships are expected to replace the current, smaller River Class vessels which have been policing the UK's waters since 2003. Mr Hammond said more than £100m would be invested in Portsmouth. The money will be used to expand the dockyard to ensure it is ready for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales as well as the Type 45 destroyers which are based in Portsmouth. Workers at BAE's Scotstoun and Govan yards were told by management there would be about 800 jobs lost in Scotland but no breakdown was given. Workers who left the yards said they were worried and disappointed, but that the announcement was not unexpected. Alex Taylor, 63, a plater at Govan, said: "We've known for a while that the workload isn't there to carry the amount of people that we had building the carriers, but hopefully voluntary redundancies will take up the slack." He added that those affected by the job cuts at Portsmouth were "working class guys the same as ourselves, they're just shipbuilders. "We're obviously relieved that things are looking better for the Clyde, but that doesn't mean to say that we've not got feelings for our comrades in Portsmouth." </body>

      <body>China's Lenovo has reported a 36% jump in profits, boosted by a surge in sales of smartphones and tablet PCs. It made a net profit of $220m (£137m) in the July-to-September quarter, as sales of mobile devices more than doubled from a year ago. Lenovo, the world's biggest PC maker, has been focusing on mobile devices amid a slowing global PC market. Its combined shipments of smartphones and tablets have now surpassed those of PCs for two quarters in a row. Shipments of smartphones rose 78% year-on-year in the three months to the end of September, while those of tablets rose more than fourfold to 2.3 million units. "Lenovo not only remains the top PC company in the world, but is also already the number four player in both smartphones and tablets worldwide and continues growing rapidly," Yang Yuanqing, chief executive of Lenovo, said in a statement. He added Lenovo was likely to see further growth in the coming months helped by a recovery in the PC market as well as continued growth in the tablet PC sector. "These are Lenovo's strength areas. We are confident that we will capture these opportunities," he said. Lenovo said that a recovery in the Chinese market - which accounts for nearly 40% of its revenue - would boost its growth further. </body>

      <body>The last 300 Blockbuster Video film rental stores in the US are closing in the face of unrelenting competition from online digital video, corporate parent company Dish Network has said. About 2,800 people are expected to lose their jobs by early January. The once-dominant chain filed for bankruptcy, pummelled by Netflix's DVD-by-post and online streaming services. Dish Network, a satellite television provider, will also end Blockbuster's own DVD-by-post service in December. About 50 US stores that are operated as independent franchises will remain open. "This is not an easy decision, yet consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment," said Joseph Clayton, Dish president and chief executive officer, in a statement. "Despite our closing of the physical distribution elements of the business, we continue to see value in the Blockbuster brand, and we expect to leverage that brand as we continue to expand our digital offerings." The firm's UK division was sold to private equity firm Gordon Brothers Europe in March, two months after it went into administration. But Blockbuster UK went back into administration in late October, as Gordon Brothers said it was unable to broker a licensing deal with Dish to start a new digital platform for the brand. The BBC has learned that Blockbuster's UK online subscription service has been suspended. </body>

      <body>(Close): The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Wednesday. The index was helped by a 4% gain for shares in Microsoft, which rose following a report that the company has narrowed its search for a new chief executive. Overall the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 128 points or 0.8% higher at 15,746. The SandP 500 closed 0.4% higher at 1,770 - just one point short of its record. "The markets are going to slowly drift up higher, unless there is something to keep it from happening," said Randy Frederick, from stock broker Charles Schwab. Traders are also betting that the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) is unlikely to end its stimulus programme in the near future. Currently it is pumping $85bn into the economy every month by buying government bonds, which is helping to keep interest rates extremely low. Late on Tuesday the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank said the Fed should wait for more solid evidence of economic growth before phasing out that effort. "What's seeping into the market is the increasing likelihood [the Fed] will keep zero percent interest rates for 18 months longer than they had signalled previously," said Steven Einhorn from the hedge fund Omega Advisors. Meanwhile Microsoft shares jumped more than 4% following a Reuters report that the company has narrowed the list of potential new chief executives to five people. It says the list includes Ford chief executive, Alan Mulally and former Nokia chief executive, Stephen Elop. Microsoft has been looking for a new boss since August when Steve Ballmer said he would step down within a year. Investors are hoping for a shift in strategy at Microsoft, which is still very profitable, but has been overtaken in important areas of technology by rivals including Google and Apple. </body>

      <body>Aaron Ramsey's header gave Arsenal a battling victory over Borussia Dortmund to keep Arsene Wenger's side top of Champions League Group F. Wojciech Szczesny denied Marco Reus and Jakub Blaszczykowski as Arsenal looked to contain Dortmund in the first hour. The Gunners scored with their first effort at goal when Ramsey forced home Mesut Ozil's cross after 62 minutes. Ramsey almost made it 2-0 moments later and an increasingly desperate Dortmund side could not deny them a famous win. Arsenal became the first English team to win at Dortmund's imposing Westfalenstadion home with their 14th win in 15 unbeaten away games. That run started in March with a victory at Bayern Munich - the eventual European champions - and this result against the team Bayern beat in last season's final was just as impressive. Ramsey's goal secured the points, but the win came on the back of a measured performance that saw Arsenal keep Dortmund at arm's length for long periods and score with a classic counter-attack. The Gunners concentrated on keeping possession in the first half but their conservative approach meant they had just one corner to show for it. At the other end, Dortmund were producing some typically inventive approach play but struggled to find a way through the visitors' defence, and were unable to find a finish when they did. Neven Subotic hooked a volley wide after Ramsey inadvertently headed a Reus free-kick back into the danger zone, and Blaszczykowski was also off target when he met Kevin Grosskreutz's cross. The home side's best chance before the break fell to Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was teed up by Blaszczykowski but fired wide after trying to pick his spot from the edge of the area. Trying to keep a team with as much attacking flair as Dortmund quiet appeared a risky tactic, especially when the home side upped the tempo early in the second half. A Reus header zipped up off the slick surface and forced Szczesny into his first save of the night, quickly followed by his second from a Blaszczykowski snap-shot following a quick break. Reus buried the follow-up but the flag was already up for offside. Just as the Dortmund pressure was building, however, Arsenal struck with their first meaningful attack. Olivier Giroud caused havoc in the area from Ozil's cross and Ramsey darted in to beat Neven Subotic to the dropping ball, stooping to head past Roman Weidenfeller. What had been a cagey game suddenly became wide open and moments later another Arsenal counter-attack almost saw them extend their lead. Ramsey was again on the end of it but this time his shot was pushed away by Weidenfeller. Dortmund threatened an immediate response when Reus failed to convert Lewandowski's cross but there was more happening at the other end, with Nuri Sahin clearing off the line and Per Mertesacker almost getting on the end of an inviting delivery. In the end one goal was enough. Dortmund had failed to score only once in their last 60 home games and had won their last eight home ties in the Champions League, but their search for an equaliser constantly ran into dead ends and Szczesny did not have another serious save to make before the end. The win gave Arsenal much-needed revenge for their defeat at home to Dortmund a fortnight ago, but their passage through to the last 16 is still far from straightforward. Even if the Gunners beat bottom side Marseille at the Emirates on 26 November, they could still need to pick up a point at Napoli in their final group game in order to secure their progress. </body>

      <description>Rafael Nadal will end the year as world number one after beating Stanislas Wawrinka at the World Tour Finals in London.</description>

      <body>Rafael Nadal ensured he will end the year as world number one with victory over Stanislas Wawrinka at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. The Spaniard, 27, won 7-6 (7-5) 7-6 (8-6) to secure a semi-final place and guarantee he cannot be overtaken by world number two Novak Djokovic. It will be the third time Nadal - who called it "the perfect scenario" - has finished a year top of the rankings. Tomas Berdych plays David Ferrer in the day's other Group A match at 20:00 GMT. Nadal has admitted he doubted whether he would ever recapture his best form when he was forced out of the sport for over seven months with a serious knee injury. Since returning in February, his results have been spectacular. He arrived in London with a career-best record of 72 wins and six losses for the year, 10 tournament victories and Grand Slam titles at the French and US Opens that took his tally of majors to 13 - four behind all-time leader Roger Federer. "Today it was important to secure the number one at the end of the season," said Nadal. "During all the season I said it's not my goal, but the real thing is after all the success I had, after all that happened last year, I felt I deserved to be there at the end of the season. "It's one of the best things that I did in my career - to come back to number one after three seasons. That's very difficult in our sport, and after a very important injury. "That's an emotional thing for me, for sure." Two straight-sets wins within 24 hours have seen Nadal qualify from the group as efficiently as possible, and he remains on track to land the most significant title still absent from his CV. Wawrinka, 28, might be enjoying the best year of his career but Nadal remains too great a challenge for the Swiss, who has now lost all of their 12 matches without winning a single set. He got close to breaking that duck at the 25th and 26th attempts, but Nadal once again proved himself to be a supreme competitor. Under pressure at 5-5 in the first tie-break, the Spaniard played a brilliant defensive backhand that dropped on the baseline and Wawrinka pulled a backhand wide to offer up set point. When Wawrinka stumbled at the net, the world number one swooped in to fire a forehand past him and take a grip on the match. The frustration of yet again failing to win a set after 61 minutes of hard work boiled over and Wawrinka was warned for racquet abuse as he headed to his chair. In a tense start to the second set he complained to umpire Carlos Bernardes about the noise coming from the watching Nadal camp. However, the official took no action despite admitting it was "not normal". Nadal needed no help from his camp or his large following among the 17,000 spectators to get the key break in game four as Wawrinka dumped a volley in the net and made two forehand errors. The Swiss challenge looked all but over at 4-1 down, but Wawrinka was still creating opportunities and, after a couple of suspect volleys earlier in the match, a kind net cord helped him get back on level terms. Wawrinka was playing the more spectacular winners but, just as in the first set, it was Nadal who prevailed when the pressure was really on in the tie-break. A smash saved set point and the Spaniard clinched victory after two hours and 12 minutes when Wawrinka made his 23rd forehand error of the match. Asked about his complaints to the umpire in the second set, Wawrinka said: "It's nothing personal against Rafa or against Toni [Nadal, coach and uncle]. "We all know, players and umpire, that Toni is always trying to help Rafa. That's normal. That's part of the game. But when it's too much, it's too much. "Today I didn't agree with the umpire that he didn't tell him something or he didn't give him second warning just because it was Rafa." Meanwhile, Tomas Berdych reignited his hopes of reaching the semi-finals with a straight-sets 6-4 6-4 win over David Ferrer in the evening session. </body>

      <body>Lionel Messi scored twice for Barcelona as they booked their place in the knockout stages of the Champions League with a comfortable win over AC Milan. Messi scored his first goal in four games with a penalty after Neymar had been fouled by Ignazio Abate. Sergio Busquets headed in a second from Xavi's free-kick before the lead was reduced when Kaka's cross was turned in by the unfortunate Gerard Pique. Messi clipped in his second after a swift one-two with Cesc Fabregas. The result extends the Catalan side's lead at the top of Group H to five points over the Italian club, who have five points with two games to play. Milan now travel to Celtic knowing that victory could also see them progress into the next round. Barcelona had 63% possession and 19 shots on target - more than four times Milan's total. Neymar came close early on when he collected Messi's through-ball only to see his strike blocked by Urby Emanuelson. Milan keeper Christian Abbiati then denied Neymar and Alexis Sanchez before Barca finally made the breakthrough from the spot. Xavi chipped a ball over the Milan defence for Neymar, who was tugged back in the area by Milan defender Abate. Messi smashed in the resulting penalty for his first goal since scoring in the reverse fixture against Milan two weeks ago. Barca then doubled their lead when midfielder Busquets stooped to head past Abbiati from Xavi's teasing delivery from a free-kick. Just before half-time, Milan were given a lifeline when Pique turned Kaka's low delivery into his own net. Milan boss Massimiliano Allegri, whose side are only 11th in the Serie A table, brought on striker Mario Balotelli for the ineffective Robinho after the break but it made little difference as Barca dominated. Abbiati produced a great save to prevent Andres Iniesta from scoring before the keeper pushed away Sanchez's point-blank effort. But he could do little to stop Messi from scoring the third, when the Argentine linked up with Fabregas before skipping through the defence and lifting his shot high into the net. </body>

      <title>Nazi hoard: Allies 'returned items'</title>
      <description>Some of the works of Nazi-looted art presented on Tuesday were confiscated by the Allies and later returned to an art dealer, say German media reports.</description>

      <body>Some of the works of Nazi-looted art presented in Munich on Tuesday were confiscated by the Allies after World War Two, and later returned to an art dealer, say German media reports. Suddeutsche Zeitung says Hildebrand Gurlitt successfully lobbied the Allies for the return of more than 100 works. Some of the items were among more than 1,400 art works found in the apartment of Gurlitt's son, Cornelius, it says. The hoard's total value is estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Meanwhile, the German government says it now favours publishing some details about the art works; Jewish groups and others had said there should be immediate full disclosure of what is in the collection. The Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper says it based its findings on the transcripts of interviews conducted by the Allies with the art dealer, Hildebrand Gurlitt. The newspaper says a list attached to one of the transcripts provides information about more than 100 pieces in what Hildebrand Gurlitt claimed to be his private collection. According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung report, Hildebrand Gurlitt lobbied the Allies for the return of this collection, which had been confiscated in 1945, and at the time was stored at a United States depot in Wiesbaden, in south-west Germany. The Allies returned this private collection - excluding two pieces - in 1950, says the report. The list of items given back to Hildebrand Gurlitt is reported to include some of the works of art presented by German officials on Tuesday, including a painting by Marc Chagall and a self-portrait by Otto Dix. Prosecutors say 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works were seized in Munich in March 2012 in the flat of Cornelius Gurlitt, who was being investigated for tax evasion. They included previously unregistered works by Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse; there were also works by Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Canaletto. The issue of ownership is still being clarified. Investigators have so far released very few details about the 1,400 works, saying that they are still continuing their investigations, and that people should come forward with inquiries. But Jewish groups are among those that have called for the works to be made public immediately, so that the families of Holocaust victims can identify and recover art that was taken from them. A German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters on Wednesday that "the government is in favour of publishing information about those artworks where there are already indications that they may have been confiscated from people persecuted by the Nazis". </body>

      <title>Korean festival brings hits to London</title>

      <body>The eighth London Korean Film Festival opens this week, offering UK audiences the chance to see a number of titles that have enjoyed unexpected box office success in their home country. They include festival opener Hide and Seek, a low-budget home invasion thriller that reached five million ticket sales in less than three weeks, despite having no established stars. Also on the line-up is The Flu, a disaster movie about an influenza epidemic that had a similarly strong reaction in South Korea last August. Secretly, Greatly - a comedy about North Korean spies stationed in the South that enjoyed the biggest opening weekend for a domestic release last June - is another crowd-pleaser to feature in the programme. The event will also screen Wish, whose dramatisation of a real-life child abuse case that became a cause celebre in South Korea saw it top the country's box office chart last month. The resurgence of home-grown product has not gone unnoticed, with Variety's Patrick Frater remarking this week that "things are looking up for Korean cinema". "This year has seen a succession of local stories that emerged from indie roots... films made by first or second-time directors... and pic[ture]s that became hits without recognisable stars," the journal's Asia correspondent said. Earlier this year, Screen Daily reported South Korea's box office hit a record high in the first half of 2013 with 98.5 million admissions. More than half of these admissions were for local films, a factor that led Variety to suggest Korean cinema was "on the cusp of a new golden era". Its prediction appears to be borne out by Snowpiercer, an ambitious sci-fi epic whose $40m (£24.8m) budget makes it the most expensive South Korean release ever. The English-language film, whose international cast includes Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt, has made almost $60m (£37m) in South Korea since opening in August according to Box Office Mojo. It has since opened in France on 300 screens - the widest release ever in that country for a Korean film. Where the film goes from there remains a moot point, though, amid reports the film is to be substantially cut before distribution worldwide. The launch of this year's London Korean Film Festival conveniently coincides with a state visit by Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president. The president's visit will include a special preview of Hide and Seek, to take place in London later ahead of the festival's official launch on Thursday. The South Korean leader was in Paris earlier this week and made a point of highlighting Snowpiercer as an example of cultural collaboration between her country and Europe. "It is my hope that such similar collaborations can take place in terms of cultural content and technology, and furthermore contribute to cooperative relations," she said on Monday. Her attendance later will bring an additional charge to an event that has some experience when it comes to attracting high-profile guests. Last year's closing night gala, for example, saw Bruce Willis, John Malkovich and Dame Helen Mirren come out in support for Korean actor Lee Byung-hun, with whom they were shooting action sequel Red 2 at the time. Following this year's events in London, the 2013 Korean Film Festival - which features no films from North Korea - will present highlights from its programme in Oxford, Bradford and St Andrews. It will, however, have to compete for audiences with other specialised showcases of international cinema that are running concurrently. The capital is also playing host to the UK Jewish Film Festival, which is holding events in London, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow until 17 November. This week also sees the launch of the 21st UK French Film Festival, which will bring a selection of Gallic offerings to London, Warwick and eight locations in Scotland until 7 December. </body>

      <title>Cameron firm sued over crash death</title>
      <description>The family of one of two filmmakers killed in a helicopter crash in Australia takes legal action against James Cameron's production company, Lightstorm Entertainment.</description>

      <body>The family of one of two filmmakers killed in a 2012 helicopter crash in Australia has taken legal action against James Cameron's production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. Award-winning cameraman Mike deGruy was working on the Titanic director's documentary DeepSea Challenge. He and writer and producer Andrew Wight both died when the helicopter crashed and caught fire shortly after take-off. Mr deGruy's family are seeking unspecified damages from Lightstorm. Legal papers were filed at Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday. The legal papers also name Andrew Wight's estate, Robinson Helicopter Company, Cameron Pace Group and Earthship Productions as defendants, although Cameron himself is not named. The helicopter crashed on 4 February last year, on an airstrip near Nowra, New South Wales. Mr deGruy and Mr Wight, who was piloting the aircraft, were headed to Jervis Bay to film a specially equipped submarine. In the 45-page legal document, which can be viewed via Deadline Hollywood, the estate of Michael deGruy states that Wight noticed his side door was open when he was ten feet off the ground, and reached with his hand to close it before losing control of the aircraft. That papers claim the defendants should have known that Mr Wight "was incompetent or unfit to fly the subject helicopter". The wrongful death legal claim also adds that the helicopter, which caught fire after the fuel tank ruptured, "was not crashworthy and its design posed a risk of severe injury and/or death in the event of a crash." Mr deGruy had also worked with Cameron on his 2005 documentary, Last Mysteries of the Titanic, as the director of undersea photography. The Emmy and Bafta-winning cameraman had also contributed heavily to BBC series Life in the Freezer, The Trials of Life and Blue Planet. At the time of the crash, Cameron said in a statement: "Mike and Andrew were like family to me. They were my deep-sea brothers and both were true explorers who did extraordinary things and went places no human being has been." </body>

      <title>How will Thai amnesty bill row end?</title>
      <description>Have Thai leaders miscalculated on amnesty bill?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24846792</url>
      <date>1383796431</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70960000/jpg/_70960584_019884991-1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Over the past two weeks, a period of relative calm in Thai politics has been shattered. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Bangkok in a striking echo of previous protest movements that, over the last decade, have led to a military coup, the occupation of the main international airport, the court-ordered resignation of two prime ministers and a military operation in 2010 that cost more than 90 lives. Those years of turmoil surrounding the figure of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra left Thailand shocked and exhausted in 2010. For the past three years there has been little appetite for confrontation. Efforts by hard-line royalists to rally demonstrations against the government of Mr Thaksin's sister, Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, went nowhere. All that changed last month when Mr Thaksin's party, Pheu Thai, suddenly expanded a modest amnesty proposal, which initially covered only ordinary people charged for involvement in past protests, to a sweeping absolution for all convictions related to political conflicts dating back to 2004. It appeared to overturn not only Mr Thaksin's own 2008 conviction for abuse of power, but also to absolve those responsible for ordering the military to open fire on his supporters in 2010. Thailand's commission for fighting corruption has estimated that 25,331 cases of corruption might be affected by the proposed amnesty. Just about the only convictions not covered by the amnesty were the hundreds of people prosecuted under Thailand's severe lese majeste law. Crucially, it appears to open the door for Mr Thaksin to return from more than five years in exile. The protests this time have been passionate and wide-ranging. Opposition has come from academics, judges, doctors and nurses, students, office workers, as well as more long-standing Thaksin opponents in the opposition Democrat Party and from the yellow-shirt groups that helped unseat him and his allies between 2006 and 2008. There have been noisy lunch-break demonstrations in Bangkok's business district, and a sit-in at Democracy Monument in the old royal quarter, as well as many smaller protests. Even some in the red-shirt movement that has campaigned in support of Mr Thaksin have now come out against this bill. "This is about much more than party politics. It's about defeating a law that has united the country in opposition to it", said Korn Chatikavanij, a former finance minister who resigned from the deputy-leadership of the Democrat Party so that he could help organise the protests. Suddenly the Democrats, who have been unable to defeat Pheu Thai in elections or in parliament, have found themselves at the head of a swelling mass movement, much of it calling for the government to be thrown out. Resolution of the issue, though, still rests with parliament, notwithstanding the deep disenchantment of the government's opponents with Thailand's messy democracy. Having been rammed through the lower house, comfortably dominated by the Pheu Thai party and its allies, the amnesty bill has now gone to Thailand's much-maligned upper house, or Senate, for approval. Over the past decade the Senate has done little to fulfil its constitutional role as a check on the actions of the lower house. Under the governments of Thaksin Shinawatra, from 2001 to 2006, it was a fully elected body. But the overweening influence of Mr Thaksin's party, and the tendency of powerful political figures to find relatives or proxies to run as Senate candidates, rendered the upper house almost toothless. After the 2006 coup the new constitution turned the Senate into a semi-appointed body, in the hope of diluting the influence of political parties. But it has still rarely challenged the incumbent government. Much the same was expected to happen with the amnesty bill. But the Senate president has already announced that most senators will reject the bill in its current form. Whether this defiance is down to the escalating public opposition to the bill or to the convictions of the senators themselves is not clear. They are due to start debating it on 11 November. If that happens, the bill must go back to the lower house, which cannot re-present it, or an alternative, for 180 days. In a statement on 5 November Ms Yingluck said she would leave the bill to the senators' judgement and that the government would respect their verdict. All the signs are that the Pheu Thai party is heading for a humiliating retreat. How did a party with a commanding majority in parliament, that has pushed its populist agenda so confidently since coming to office, get this so wrong? It is clear that this bill was Mr Thaksin's doing. Throughout her premiership Ms Yingluck has been overshadowed by accusations that she is a mere puppet, and that all the key decisions are made by her brother. Those accusations have not always been justified, and her conciliatory governing style has won her praise even from her opponents. But on the amnesty, the most contentious and personal issue she has grappled with, she has not even pretended to take decisions. She chose to be absent from parliament when it approved the bill, and has stated that it is the party, not her, who wanted it. Meanwhile Mr Thaksin, from exile, has given interviews insisting that such a sweeping amnesty was the best way forward, that it would reset the country back to zero, wiping out all the conflicts that started during his time in office. The effect has been the opposite. The stark polarisation of Thai society is once again in full view. And the broad spectrum of opposition to the amnesty, albeit mainly in Bangkok, has uncomfortable similarities to the protests in early 2006 that forced Mr Thaksin, then prime minister, to call an early election, events that led eventually to the September coup. Back then he badly miscalculated the public reaction to the sale, at great profit to his family, of his company, Shin Corp. It looks like he has overplayed his hand once more. There are some important differences, though. This time, the Pheu Thai party has been working hard to build a working relationship with the royalist upper echelons of the military. The sometimes outspoken army commander General Prayuth Chan-ocha has been conspicuously quiet about the amnesty and the protests. Another coup seems very unlikely. Nor is the hard-line yellow-shirt movement, the essential core of any long-term street movement to pressure the government, what it was. It has fragmented, and if government concessions take the steam out of the protests, it is hard to see how they will keep up their momentum. That, then, will present the Democrat Party, which has been riding high for the past two weeks, with its old dilemma; how to beat Mr Thaksin, whether he is in or out of the country, in a general election. It is a dilemma to which Thailand's oldest political party still has no answer. </body>

      <description>New York elects its first Democratic mayor for 20 years</description>

      <body>New York's next mayor is a liberal who started his career in the politics of America's biggest city during the leadership of its first black mayor. Bill de Blasio, 52, campaigned on a promise to reverse the city's rising income inequality, combined with sharp attacks on a city police policy that critics say violates the civil rights of minorities. After surviving a nine-way Democratic mayoral primary, Mr de Blasio won against Republican candidate Joe Lhota by a 49-point margin. He is now set to become New York's first Democratic mayor since 1993, in charge of one of the world's most high-profile metropolises and eight million residents. Mr de Blasio was born in Manhattan in 1961 but raised in Massachusetts by his mother's family after his parents divorced. His father, a troubled Navy veteran, later killed himself after being diagnosed with incurable lung cancer. His original name was Warren Wilhelm Jr. Mr de Blasio later took his mother's maiden name. He returned to New York to study Latin American politics at New York University and later gained a master's degree in international affairs from Columbia University. The internationally minded young Mr de Blasio travelled to Nicaragua as part of a social justice group in the 1980s. According to the New York Times, he was once an admirer of the country's ruling Sandinistas - at a time when President Ronald Reagan was harshly criticising the party. In 1989, Mr de Blasio joined the campaign of New York Mayor David Dinkins, the city's first black leader. He continued to work as an aide to the mayor after he won election. While working for Mr Dinkins, Mr de Blasio met his future wife, Chirlane McCray, an African-American writer and political activist who had previously identified as a lesbian. They married in 1994 and have two children, Chiara and Dante. President Bill Clinton appointed him to be a regional director of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) during the 1990s. He re-entered New York City politics by successfully running for the school board in his Brooklyn neighbourhood. Shortly afterwards he became campaign manager for Hillary Clinton's successful 2000 run for the US Senate, though he did not follow her to Washington. Instead, Mr de Blasio was elected to New York City Council in 2001, representing an area of Brooklyn that was both increasingly wealthy and increasingly diverse. After two terms in the council, Mr de Blasio was elected as the city's public advocate - a sort of all-city ombudsman - often placing him in direct opposition to Mayor Michael Bloomberg. He entered a crowded Democratic primary in the 2013 mayoral race advocating for increased income taxes on wealthier New Yorkers to fund education programmes and a "clean break" from the Bloomberg era. His rise to the top of the primary pack was aided by the implosion of the campaign of former congressman Anthony Weiner. His biracial son, Dante, also appeared in a crucial television ad which promised Mr de Blasio would end New York's controversial stop-and-frisk policy, which has been criticised over disproportionate targeting of black and Hispanic men. The new mayor will take office on 1 January 2014. </body>

      <body>The Farouk family were so frightened that we had to visit their house under cover of night to hear their story. They are Sunni Muslims and say they received an ultimatum to leave their house from Shia extremists who have been spreading fear among Sunnis living in the al-Zubair district of the southern Iraqi city of Basra. The father showed me a scrap of paper with few words written on one of its corners. It was a threat to kill his family if they did not leave the area where he was born 45 years ago. "'I don't care if I'm dead or alive. I care about my children," he said. "They could be kidnapped and killed, as has happened with many families." "We were displaced then in 2007. We went to Syria as refugees and returned last year. We thought that sectarianism had ended but it seems we had illusions." The mother told us that they were taking the threat seriously because they knew of other Sunnis who had been either shot dead or had left Basra for their own safety in recent months. She said was so concerned about her children that she had stopped them from going to school or even playing football in front of their house. "We won't feel peace of mind until we leave this district," she added. When the sectarian conflict between Iraq's majority Shia community and minority Shia community was at its peak between 2006 and 2007, many people were forced from their homes. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that up to two million Iraqi refugees were living in neighbouring countries in March 2007. Today, there are more than 1.1 million internally displaced people (IDPs). Most live in Baghdad, Diyala and Nineveh provinces. Some 467,000 IDPs, former refugees and squatters remain in more than 382 settlements on public land or in public buildings, enduring harsh living conditions and with limited access to electricity, sanitation, schooling or sufficient job opportunities, according to the UNHCR. This year, sectarian violence has once more become routine on the streets of Iraq, with 6,500 civilians killed since January - a death toll not seen since 2008. People are again being forced to flee areas where their sect is in the minority. In September, the UNHCR said as many as 5,000 Iraqis had fled their homes so far this year, with most fleeing from Baghdad into Anbar and Salah al-Din provinces. Traditionally mixed areas like al-Zubair have been most affected, as people leave for religiously homogeneous areas that they believe offer more safety. In the predominantly Sunni eastern province of Diyala, it is the Shia population that is being forced out. The violence is so fierce that we were refused a permit to travel there, so we asked a local journalist to interview one of the 400 Shia families who officials say have been displaced over the past two months alone. Qais and his family left their home in a Sunni area to stay with relatives in a Shia district. They now feel much safer. "Sunni extremists blew up my house and other houses in the area. We lost everything and took with us few belongings," he said. "Thank God we had just left the house area a few days before the blast." Like the Farouk family, it was the second time Qais and his children had been displaced. "The first time was in 2006. They were horrible times. I recall when we used to avoid passing by entire Sunni areas where killing on identification was rife." The rise in sectarian attacks has made the fear of violence a part of daily live for Iraqis. It dictates which market, shop or cafe they can visit, where they can live, and who can be their neighbours. They now worry there could soon be another full-blown sectarian conflict. </body>

      <title>German home school families refugees in US</title>
      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24804804</url>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, says that a strand in the home schooling movement developed in the 1970s when some Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <title>Saudi nuclear weapons 'on order' from Pakistan</title>
      <description>Mark Urban investigates reports of a Saudi nuclear arms plan</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24823846</url>
      <date>1383775061</date>

      <body>Saudi Arabia has invested in Pakistani nuclear weapons projects, and believes it could obtain atomic bombs at will, a variety of sources have told BBC Newsnight. While the kingdom's quest has often been set in the context of countering Iran's atomic programme, it is now possible that the Saudis might be able to deploy such devices more quickly than the Islamic republic. Earlier this year, a senior Nato decision maker told me that he had seen intelligence reporting that nuclear weapons made in Pakistan on behalf of Saudi Arabia are now sitting ready for delivery. Last month Amos Yadlin, a former head of Israeli military intelligence, told a conference in Sweden that if Iran got the bomb, "the Saudis will not wait one month. They already paid for the bomb, they will go to Pakistan and bring what they need to bring." Since 2009, when King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia warned visiting US special envoy to the Middle East Dennis Ross that if Iran crossed the threshold, "we will get nuclear weapons", the kingdom has sent the Americans numerous signals of its intentions. Gary Samore, until March 2013 President Barack Obama's counter-proliferation adviser, has told Newsnight: "I do think that the Saudis believe that they have some understanding with Pakistan that, in extremis, they would have claim to acquire nuclear weapons from Pakistan." The story of Saudi Arabia's project - including the acquisition of missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads over long ranges - goes back decades. In the late 1980s they secretly bought dozens of CSS-2 ballistic missiles from China. These rockets, considered by many experts too inaccurate for use as conventional weapons, were deployed 20 years ago. This summer experts at defence publishers Jane's reported the completion of a new Saudi CSS-2 base with missile launch rails aligned with Israel and Iran. It has also been clear for many years that Saudi Arabia has given generous financial assistance to Pakistan's defence sector, including, western experts allege, to its missile and nuclear labs. Visits by the then Saudi defence minister Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al Saud to the Pakistani nuclear research centre in 1999 and 2002 underlined the closeness of the defence relationship. In its quest for a strategic deterrent against India, Pakistan co-operated closely with China which sold them missiles and provided the design for a nuclear warhead. The Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan was accused by western intelligence agencies of selling atomic know-how and uranium enrichment centrifuges to Libya and North Korea. AQ Khan is also believed to have passed the Chinese nuclear weapon design to those countries. This blueprint was for a device engineered to fit on the CSS-2 missile, i.e the same type sold to Saudi Arabia. Because of this circumstantial evidence, allegations of a Saudi-Pakistani nuclear deal started to circulate even in the 1990s, but were denied by Saudi officials. They noted that their country had signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty, and called for a nuclear-free Middle East, pointing to Israel's possession of such weapons. The fact that handing over atom bombs to a foreign government could create huge political difficulties for Pakistan, not least with the World Bank and other donors, added to scepticism about those early claims. In Eating the Grass, his semi-official history of the Pakistani nuclear program, Major General Feroz Hassan Khan wrote that Prince Sultan's visits to Pakistan's atomic labs were not proof of an agreement between the two countries. But he acknowledged, "Saudi Arabia provided generous financial support to Pakistan that enabled the nuclear program to continue." Whatever understandings did or did not exist between the two countries in the 1990s, it was around 2003 that the kingdom started serious strategic thinking about its changing security environment and the prospect of nuclear proliferation. A paper leaked that year by senior Saudi officials mapped out three possible responses - to acquire their own nuclear weapons, to enter into an arrangement with another nuclear power to protect the kingdom, or to rely on the establishment of a nuclear-free zone in the Middle East. It was around the same time, following the US invasion of Iraq, that serious strains in the US/Saudi relationship began to show themselves, says Gary Samore. The Saudis resented the removal of Saddam Hussein, had long been unhappy about US policy on Israel, and were growing increasingly concerned about the Iranian nuclear program. In the years that followed, diplomatic chatter about Saudi-Pakistani nuclear cooperation began to increase. In 2007, the US mission in Riyadh noted they were being asked questions by Pakistani diplomats about US knowledge of "Saudi-Pakistani nuclear cooperation". The unnamed Pakistanis opined that "it is logical for the Saudis to step in as the physical 'protector'" of the Arab world by seeking nuclear weapons, according to one of the State Department cables posted by Wikileaks. By the end of that decade Saudi princes and officials were giving explicit warnings of their intention to acquire nuclear weapons if Iran did. Having warned the Americans in private for years, last year Saudi officials in Riyadh escalated it to a public warning, telling a journalist from the Times "it would be completely unacceptable to have Iran with a nuclear capability and not the kingdom". But were these statements bluster, aimed at forcing a stronger US line on Iran, or were they evidence of a deliberate, long-term plan for a Saudi bomb? Both, is the answer I have received from former key officials. One senior Pakistani, speaking on background terms, confirmed the broad nature of the deal - probably unwritten - his country had reached with the kingdom and asked rhetorically "what did we think the Saudis were giving us all that money for? It wasn't charity." Another, a one-time intelligence officer from the same country, said he believed "the Pakistanis certainly maintain a certain number of warheads on the basis that if the Saudis were to ask for them at any given time they would immediately be transferred." As for the seriousness of the Saudi threat to make good on the deal, Simon Henderson, Director of the Global Gulf and Energy Policy Program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told BBC Newsnight "the Saudis speak about Iran and nuclear matters very seriously. They don't bluff on this issue." Talking to many serving and former officials about this over the past few months, the only real debate I have found is about how exactly the Saudi Arabians would redeem the bargain with Pakistan. Some think it is a cash-and-carry deal for warheads, the first of those options sketched out by the Saudis back in 2003; others that it is the second, an arrangement under which Pakistani nuclear forces could be deployed in the kingdom. Gary Samore, considering these questions at the centre of the US intelligence and policy web, at the White House until earlier this year, thinks that what he calls, "the Nato model", is more likely. However ,"I think just giving Saudi Arabia a handful of nuclear weapons would be a very provocative action", says Gary Samore. He adds: "I've always thought it was much more likely - the most likely option if Pakistan were to honour any agreement would be for be for Pakistan to send its own forces, its own troops armed with nuclear weapons and with delivery systems to be deployed in Saudi Arabia". This would give a big political advantage to Pakistan since it would allow them to deny that they had simply handed over the weapons, but implies a dual key system in which they would need to agree in order for 'Saudi Arabian' "nukes" to be launched. Others I have spoken to think this is not credible, since Saudi Arabia, which regards itself as the leader of the broader Sunni Islamic 'ummah' or community, would want complete control of its nuclear deterrent, particularly at this time of worsening sectarian confrontation with Shia Iran. And it is Israeli information - that Saudi Arabia is now ready to take delivery of finished warheads for its long-range missiles - that informs some recent US and Nato intelligence reporting. Israel of course shares Saudi Arabia's motive in wanting to worry the US into containing Iran. Amos Yadlin declined to be interviewed for our BBC Newsnight report, but told me by email that "unlike other potential regional threats, the Saudi one is very credible and imminent." Even if this view is accurate there are many good reasons for Saudi Arabia to leave its nuclear warheads in Pakistan for the time being. Doing so allows the kingdom to deny there are any on its soil. It avoids challenging Iran to cross the nuclear threshold in response, and it insulates Pakistan from the international opprobrium of being seen to operate an atomic cash-and-carry. These assumptions though may not be safe for much longer. The US diplomatic thaw with Iran has touched deep insecurities in Riyadh, which fears that any deal to constrain the Islamic republic's nuclear program would be ineffective. Earlier this month the Saudi intelligence chief and former ambassador to Washington Prince Bandar announced that the kingdom would be distancing itself more from the US. While investigating this, I have heard rumours on the diplomatic grapevine, that Pakistan has recently actually delivered Shaheen mobile ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia, minus warheads. These reports, still unconfirmed, would suggest an ability to deploy nuclear weapons in the kingdom, and mount them on an effective, modern, missile system more quickly than some analysts had previously imagined. In Egypt, Saudi Arabia showed itself ready to step in with large-scale backing following the military overthrow of President Mohammed Morsi's government. There is a message here for Pakistan, of Riyadh being ready to replace US military assistance or World Bank loans, if standing with Saudi Arabia causes a country to lose them. Newsnight contacted both the Pakistani and Saudi governments. The Pakistan Foreign Ministry has described our story as "speculative, mischievous and baseless". It adds: "Pakistan is a responsible nuclear weapon state with robust command and control structures and comprehensive export controls." The Saudi embassy in London has also issued a statement pointing out that the Kingdom is a signatory to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and has worked for a nuclear free Middle East. But it also points out that the UN's "failure to make the Middle East a nuclear free zone is one of the reasons the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia rejected the offer of a seat on the UN Security Council". It says the Saudi Foreign Minister has stressed that this lack of international action "has put the region under the threat of a time bomb that cannot easily be defused by manoeuvring around it".

      <description>Twitter shares are priced at $26 each, ahead of the biggest stock market debut of a technology firm since Facebook went public in 2012.</description>

      <body>Twitter shares have been priced at $26 each, ahead of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday. That is above the $23 to $25 range announced on Monday and values the short messaging service at more than $18bn (£11bn). That makes it the biggest market debut for a technology firm since Facebook went public in May 2012. Twitter has attracted 230 million users since starting seven years ago, but is yet to make a profit. Its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier and a recent poll by Reuters/Ipsos showed that more than a third of registered users do not use the service at all. Nevertheless there was strong demand for the shares and the company was able to raise the offering price twice. Some analysts said that investors were excited by Twitter's potential for growth. "Investors see social media and mobile as sweet spots and it is therefore no surprise that Twitter's IPO is creating so much excitement and is oversubscribed," said Eden Zoller of consulting firm Ovum. However, she added that "Twitter needs to step up and deliver on the expectations that are fuelling its valuation, and show that it has what it takes to provide a sustainable business model". The firm has posted an increase in its sales, which more than doubled in third quarter to $168.6m, and it is looking to raise even more revenue from advertisers outside the United States. Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets said that he expected the firm's shares to rise after listing. "Just as Google, Amazon and Facebook have become Internet utilities, so too may Twitter," he said. "As a public, real-time, conversational and distributed platform, Twitter is becoming an essential service for consumers, businesses, media companies, and advertiser." Twitter's $18bn valuation includes the value of shares in compensation schemes for employees and other share awards. Co-founder Evan Williams is the biggest shareholder in the firm with a stake of more than 10% worth more than a billion dollars. Another of the founders, Jack Dorsey, will also become a very rich man. His 4% stake is worth more than half a billion dollars. Biz Stone, another co-founder, is thought to have made millions by selling holdings over the last few years. But Noah Glass, also one of the originals, is believed to have made very little from the company's success. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise $1.82bn, for the company. Unlike Facebook, Twitter has chosen to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook's debut on the Nasdaq - traditionally the market of choice for technology firms - was marred by delays and problems with orders. The NYSE has already tested trading of Twitter's shares to try to avoid any technical hitches. The shares will trade under the symbol "TWTR". </body>

      <body>The implementation of the government's flagship welfare reform has been "extraordinarily poor", with much of the £425m expenditure to date likely to be written off, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said oversight of the Universal Credit scheme had been "alarmingly weak". Warning signs were missed and there was a "fortress culture" among officials, it claimed. Ministers said there was new leadership and controls had been strengthened. The criticisms by the cross-party committee echo those by the National Audit Office - which said in September that management of the £2.3bn project had been weak and financial controls had been inefficient. Ministers have insisted the plan to consolidate six separate means-tested working age benefits into a single payment - designed to increase incentives for work - is back on track following a "reset" of the programme at the start of the year. But the committee said the project had been beset by a string of problems and still faced considerable challenges if it was to achieve its long-term objectives. It suggested much of the £425m spent up to April, about a third of which has been on computer software and other IT systems, was unlikely to have any worth in future and its value would have to be written off. Controls over suppliers, it added, had been largely absent with, in some cases, multi-million pound orders being signed off by secretarial staff. From the outset of the project in 2011, it said, senior civil servants had "failed to grasp the enormity" of the task they had been set by ministers, did not monitor progress adequately and had not intervened when issues arose. A lack of day-to-day control meant that top officials only became aware of difficulties through "ad hoc reviews" and as problems mounted, those in charge of the scheme had become "isolated and defensive". "Universal Credit is the Department for Work and Pensions' single biggest programme and enjoys cross-party support yet its implementation has been extraordinarily poor," Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the body, said. "The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money. "Pressure to deliver a programme of this magnitude within such an ambitious timescale created a fortress culture where only good news was reported and problems were denied." Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has insisted that Universal Credit can still be rolled out to all existing and new claimants as planned by 2017 - a view endorsed by officials from the Major Projects Authority who were drafted in earlier this year to run the rule over the scheme. But the committee said the pilots conducted to date had been unsatisfactory and a target to enrol 184,000 new claimants on to the single benefit by next April would be missed. "The department will have to speed up the later stages of the programme if it is to meet the 2017 completion date but that will pose new risks," Mrs Hodge added, urging the government not to throw "good money after bad". "We believe strongly that meeting any specific timetable from now on is less important than delivering the programme successfully." Appearing before the committee in September, the top civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions rejected suggestions the Universal Credit was launched "without a plan". Robert Devereux said the strategy behind the policy was "very clear" and the "best available" people were running it. But he accepted there had been a "let's punch through" mentality among the original management team and its leadership was changed once it became clear that a different, more reflective approach was needed. Howard Shiplee, who took over the running of the project in May, has admitted mistakes were made but said real progress was now happening and much of the existing IT systems could be used. Responding to the committee's report, the Department for Work and Pensions said Universal Credit was a "vital" reform which would ultimately bring £38bn in benefits to society by helping people into work and reducing fraud. "This report doesn't take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery," it said. "We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls." It said it did not accept "the write-off figure quoted by the committee" and expected it to be substantially less. A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith said he had "every confidence" in the team now running the programme, including Mr Devereux - whose position some newspapers have suggested is under threat. "Both the National Audit Office and the public accounts committee acknowledged a fortress mentality within the Universal Credit programme," he said. "Iain was clear back in the summer about how he and the permanent secretary took action to fix those problems." For Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the report was "another nail in the coffin of the government's promise to deliver Universal Credit on time and on budget", adding that "families facing a cost of living crisis need welfare reform they can trust". </body>

      <title>Online absence hits Morrisons' sales</title>
      <description>Morrisons, the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain, blames its lack of online deliveries for a 2.4% fall in like-for-like sales.</description>

      <body>Morrisons, the UK's fourth-largest supermarket chain, has reported a 2.4% fall in like-for-like sales, excluding fuel, in the three months to November. The supermarket said its sales were continuing to suffer because it does not yet offer online deliveries, and it has only a small number of convenience stores. Convenience stores are a currently a major growth area for supermarkets. Morrisons is planning to launch its online service in January next year. It will start food deliveries in Warwickshire, before rolling out the service to other parts of the country. It says it hopes to cover 50% of households by the end of the year. The company is also expanding its chain of "M local" convenience stores, and opened 36 new stores in the past three months, bringing its total to 69. It plans to open a further 100 M local stores in the 2014-15 financial year. "Consumer confidence remains subdued and we continue to see heavy promotional activity across the industry," Morrisons said in a statement. "As previously indicated, our low exposure to the sector's key growth areas of convenience and online continues to impact the sales performance of the group." The company said the sales performance was in line with its expectations, although it was worse than many analysts had expected. It said its outlook for the full financial year was unchanged, but said it expected the market to remain "challenging". Morrisons is the UK's fourth-largest supermarket in terms of revenues, behind Tesco, Asda and Sainsbury's, all of which already have online offerings. Online grocery shopping is currently growing at a rate of about 16% a year, while the convenience store sector is growing at about 20% a year. </body>

      <title>BAE workers digest job cuts news</title>
      <description>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24847413</url>

      <body>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy. They were sent home on Wednesday after the announcement of job cuts, which include about 800 in Scotland. Most of the jobs will go in Portsmouth where shipbuilding will end altogether. There will also be job losses in Filton, near Bristol. Unions at Scotland's shipyards said they hoped many of the job losses would be found through voluntary redundancy. The Scottish yards include Govan and Scotstoun, on the River Clyde in Glasgow, and Rosyth in Fife. The Clyde yards have been earmarked for building the new Type 26 warships. The UK government has been accused by MPs in the south-east of England of sacrificing shipbuilding in Portsmouth because of next year's independence referendum. However, the Scottish government has accused it of "absurd" threat to jobs in Glasgow in the event of a Yes vote. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that in the event of independence, a UK government would be bound to want to build warships inside the UK and not in Scotland. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said Scotland would find it "difficult" to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country voted for independence. But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that in an independent Scotland, joint procurement of Type 26 frigates could be possible. She said: "These ships will be built on the Clyde because BAE said yesterday, and the defence secretary said yesterday, that it's the best place to build them because of the investment we have seen in these yards, because of the skills mix and because of the value for money. "Type 26 frigates, offshore patrol vessels - these are exactly the kind of vessels that an independent Scottish government would need. So we would be procuring some of these Type 26 frigates. "Actually, the sensible proposition in that scenario would be a joint procurement." However, former Conservative Defence Minister Sir Gerald Howarth told the programme the issue was about European law. He said: "Under article 346, national security determines that if we wish to maintain exclusivity in the United Kingdom in order to maintain our sovereign capability, then we can do so. "If Scotland were no longer part of the United Kingdom, then Scotland would not enjoy that same privilege which they enjoy today. "Nor would the United Kingdom enjoy that same exemption." The defence contractor and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have announced measures which they hope will offset the effect of the job cuts. Among the plans are more than £100m of investment to expand the dockyard at Portsmouth. Three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal Navy will also be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. This could help sustain shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 Global Combat ships. BAE said it had agreed with the MoD "that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships". "The company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy," it said. It said the cost of this restructuring would be borne by the MoD. BAE said it would now begin consultation to cut 1,775 jobs "to result from these restructuring proposals". The MoD confirmed that it would commission three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels to play "a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti smuggling operations". It said these would be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards. Work on the new vessels is due to begin next year with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017. The ships are expected to replace the current, smaller River Class vessels which have been policing the UK's waters since 2003. Mr Hammond said more than £100m would be invested in Portsmouth. The money will be used to expand the dockyard to ensure it is ready for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales as well as the Type 45 destroyers which are based in Portsmouth. Workers at BAE's Scotstoun and Govan yards were told by management there would be about 800 jobs lost in Scotland but no breakdown was given. Workers who left the yards said they were worried and disappointed, but that the announcement was not unexpected. Alex Taylor, 63, a plater at Govan, said: "We've known for a while that the workload isn't there to carry the amount of people that we had building the carriers, but hopefully voluntary redundancies will take up the slack." He added that those affected by the job cuts at Portsmouth were "working class guys the same as ourselves, they're just shipbuilders. "We're obviously relieved that things are looking better for the Clyde, but that doesn't mean to say that we've not got feelings for our comrades in Portsmouth." </body>

      <body>London Gateway, the UK's newest container port, is due to welcome its first vessel. The £1.5bn facility at Thurrock, Essex, is 20 miles (32km) down the River Thames from London. It is owned by Dubai-based DP World, which says it will be able to handle 3.5 million containers a year. It is forecast that the development will create 27,000 jobs in London and the South East and contribute £2.4bn a year to its economy. On a visit to the site in June, Prime Minister David Cameron described the port as an "emblem of ambition". But trade union Unite has previously held protests at the port as part of a row over union recognition. The union claims that rather than creating jobs, London Gateway could suck business and jobs away from other UK ports, as well as undermine the pay and conditions of workers. DP World has said that if a majority of workers wished to be recognised, it would enter talks with the relevant union. The first vessel scheduled to dock at the port is the MOL Caledon, a 58,000-tonne container ship, laden with fruit and wine from South Africa. </body>

      <body>China's Lenovo has reported a 36% jump in profits, boosted by a surge in sales of smartphones and tablet PCs. It made a net profit of $220m (£137m) in the July-to-September quarter, as sales of mobile devices more than doubled from a year ago. Lenovo, the world's biggest PC maker, has been focusing on mobile devices amid a slowing global PC market. Its combined shipments of smartphones and tablets have now surpassed those of PCs for two quarters in a row. Shipments of smartphones rose 78% year-on-year in the three months to the end of September, while those of tablets rose more than fourfold to 2.3 million units. "Lenovo not only remains the top PC company in the world, but is also already the number four player in both smartphones and tablets worldwide and continues growing rapidly," Yang Yuanqing, chief executive of Lenovo, said in a statement. He added Lenovo was likely to see further growth in the coming months helped by a recovery in the PC market as well as continued growth in the tablet PC sector. "These are Lenovo's strength areas. We are confident that we will capture these opportunities," he said. Lenovo said that a recovery in the Chinese market - which accounts for nearly 40% of its revenue - would boost its growth further. </body>

      <body>India's central bank has unveiled new rules that will allow foreign banks to expand their presence in the country. Foreign banks will now be allowed to set up "wholly owned subsidiaries" in India, which will enable them to open branches anywhere in the country. The subsidiaries will need a minimum capital of 5bn rupees ($80m; £50m). The changes are a part of the push by the central bank's new governor, Raghuram Rajan, to liberalise the sector as he looks to boost growth. Foreign banks have long wanted to boost their presence in the country - home to nearly 1.2 billion people. However so far they have had to face tight regulations, especially over the number of branches they can open. The Reserve Bank of India said the new rules would allow them to open branches "at par with Indian banks". However, they will need permission to open branches in "certain locations that are sensitive from the perspective of national security". The RBI said it would also consider introducing takeover rules that would allow foreign companies to own as much as 74% of a domestic bank. But it said any such decision will be taken after a review relating to "the extent of penetration of foreign investment in Indian banks and functioning of foreign banks". </body>

      <title>Many councils 'plan to increase tax'</title>
      <description>Many English councils look set to increase council tax next year, despite government cash on offer if they freeze it, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Almost a third of all English councils plan to increase council tax next year despite a government cash incentive to freeze it, a survey suggests. According to the research published by the Local Government Chronicle, Conservative-run county councils are most likely to be considering a rise. Ministers said councillors faced a choice between helping with the cost of living or increasing local taxes. But 75% of the county councils which responded said they planned a rise. Out of 354 councils, 154 responded to the survey. 53% said they would accept the extra government funding on offer - equivalent to a 1% council tax rise. On the other hand 32% said they would not accept the funding and were considering a rise - likely to be up to 1.9% since a rise of above 2% requires a referendum. 15% said they did not know. Of 27 county councils, 12 responded to the Local Government Chronicle survey, and nine of these said they would reject the extra government funding. Two said they would accept the government's funding and agree to freeze taxes for two years, and one did not know. David Hodge, chairman of the County Councils Network and leader of Surrey County Council, said counties faced a "particularly challenging set of circumstances". He said that demand for services - such as adult social care - was rising, roads had "taken a hell of a hammering" and were costly to repair and there was a "major shortage" in school places. "Central government has a choice - they can either support councils in meeting growing demand pressures via direct support or by giving councils the flexibility to raise taxes locally," he added. "We are already finding it difficult to ensure our books balance." But Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis said he would "encourage every council" to take up the offer of funding, which would be paid in financial years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. "Over the last three years, the government has worked with councils to cut council tax by 10% in real terms," he said. "Extra funding is on the table for councils to freeze council tax for another two years. "There is a clear choice for councillors: extra help for hard-working people with the cost of living, or higher state taxation to fund more council administration." </body>

      <body>(Close): The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at a record high on Wednesday. The index was helped by a 4% gain for shares in Microsoft, which rose following a report that the company has narrowed its search for a new chief executive. Overall the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 128 points or 0.8% higher at 15,746. The SandP 500 closed 0.4% higher at 1,770 - just one point short of its record. "The markets are going to slowly drift up higher, unless there is something to keep it from happening," said Randy Frederick, from stock broker Charles Schwab. Traders are also betting that the US Federal Reserve (the Fed) is unlikely to end its stimulus programme in the near future. Currently it is pumping $85bn into the economy every month by buying government bonds, which is helping to keep interest rates extremely low. Late on Tuesday the president of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank said the Fed should wait for more solid evidence of economic growth before phasing out that effort. "What's seeping into the market is the increasing likelihood [the Fed] will keep zero percent interest rates for 18 months longer than they had signalled previously," said Steven Einhorn from the hedge fund Omega Advisors. Meanwhile Microsoft shares jumped more than 4% following a Reuters report that the company has narrowed the list of potential new chief executives to five people. It says the list includes Ford chief executive, Alan Mulally and former Nokia chief executive, Stephen Elop. Microsoft has been looking for a new boss since August when Steve Ballmer said he would step down within a year. Investors are hoping for a shift in strategy at Microsoft, which is still very profitable, but has been overtaken in important areas of technology by rivals including Google and Apple. </body>

      <body>Tesla shares plunged 14% to $151.1 after its chief executive said battery shortages were hampering production. Elon Musk said the shortage is likely to continue until next year when a new deal with supplier Panasonic starts. It has been a volatile year so far for Tesla's shares. They soared 400% to hit a record high in September, but have fallen more than 20% since then. On Tuesday, the firm reported its latest quarterly earnings which fell short of market expectations. The company said it made a net loss of $38m in the July-to-September period. Even though the loss narrowed from a year ago, investors seemed worried over the company's short term prospects. Those concerns were prompted after Mr Musk said the firm had been struggling to ramp up production. "We really are production-constrained, not demand-constrained," Mr Musk had told reporters after the earnings release. "It doesn't make sense to do things to amplify demand if we can't meet that demand with production." Tesla said it sold 5,500 of its model S cars during the period. It had forecast deliveries of just under 6,000 cars during the current quarter. Both figures were less than industry observers had been forecasting. However, some analysts said the model continues to remain popular with customers and the firm is likely to see further growth in sales once it can resolve its production issues. Elaine Kwei, an analyst with Jefferies, said the July-September period had been "another quarter of remarkable progress since volume deliveries of the Model S began one year ago".' "With a technology advantage, desirable and differentiated products, and proven execution, we think we're only scratching the surface of things to come," she added. The company is also preparing to introduce its Model X crossover in the coming months and a low-cost electric car over the next few years. But some analysts were sceptical over the success of a low-cost electric vehicle. "The market has shown no appetite, in our opinion, for such a product," said James Albertine, an analyst with Stifel. </body>

      <body>The last 300 Blockbuster Video film rental stores in the US are closing in the face of unrelenting competition from online digital video, corporate parent company Dish Network has said. About 2,800 people are expected to lose their jobs by early January. The once-dominant chain filed for bankruptcy, pummelled by Netflix's DVD-by-post and online streaming services. Dish Network, a satellite television provider, will also end Blockbuster's own DVD-by-post service in December. About 50 US stores that are operated as independent franchises will remain open. "This is not an easy decision, yet consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment," said Joseph Clayton, Dish president and chief executive officer, in a statement. "Despite our closing of the physical distribution elements of the business, we continue to see value in the Blockbuster brand, and we expect to leverage that brand as we continue to expand our digital offerings." The firm's UK division was sold to private equity firm Gordon Brothers Europe in March, two months after it went into administration. But Blockbuster UK went back into administration in late October, as Gordon Brothers said it was unable to broker a licensing deal with Dish to start a new digital platform for the brand. The BBC has learned that Blockbuster's UK online subscription service has been suspended. </body>

      <body>BP, Royal Dutch Shell, and Statoil are among firms accused in a lawsuit of manipulating the Brent oil market. Four traders have filed a class action in a Manhattan court alleging that oil majors and trading houses have fixed prices since at least 2002. Among others named in the lawsuit are investment bank Morgan Stanley and energy traders including Vitol Group. In May, the European Commission launched an inquiry into suspected anti-competitive practices. The four traders, from the Nymex commodities exchange in New York, claim that one method used to manipulate prices was "spoofing" - placing orders to move the oil price market with the intention of cancelling them later. The North Sea Brent oil benchmark is used to price around two-thirds of world crude and determine the cost of petrol and heating fuel. In May the EC raided the offices of companies including BP, Shell and Statoil. It warned that even small distortions of prices could have a huge impact on "the prices of crude oil, refined oil products and biofuels purchases and sales, potentially harming final consumers". Shortly after the EC's raid, Chicago-based commodities trading firm Prime International filed a lawsuit against BP, Shell and Statoil, alleging collusion to fix oil prices. According to the Reuters news agency, a Statoil spokesman said on Wednesday that it was not uncommon to see private US lawsuits filed following investigations by government agencies. The other companies named declined to comment. </body>

      <body>Wells Fargo has agreed to pay $335m (£208m) to settle claims it misled investors over mortgage-backed bonds during the housing boom. The banking giant was accused of using false information in some of the documents relating to the bonds. The claims were made on behalf of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - key players in the US market - which buy mortgages and sell them to investors. Last month JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $5.1bn to settle similar claims. That was the biggest settlement ever by a US bank. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the biggest mortgage lenders in the US. They received $187bn in US taxpayer aid to help them stay afloat during the financial collapse. In 2011 the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) sued 18 banks and other financial firms over the mis-selling of mortgage-backed products to the two firms. </body>

      <body>Increased demand for homes has led to the ninth consecutive monthly increase in house prices, according to the Halifax. The mortgage lender said that property prices were up by 0.7% in October compared with the previous month and 6.9% annually. This had increased the value of the average home to £171,991, it added. However, the lender said that prices and sales had not reached the levels seen at the height of the boom in 2007. The Halifax is part of Lloyds Banking Group. The figures, which are drawn from the Halifax's own lending data, found that house prices were 1.6% higher in the last three months than the previous quarter. The lender said that there had been an increase in demand from potential buyers which had increased activity in the housing market, and had put an "upward pressure" on prices. "Low interest rates, and higher consumer confidence supported by the increasing evidence that a sustainable economic recovery may now be underway, are helping to increase housing demand," said Martin Ellis, housing economist at the Halifax. He added that sellers were showing signs of returning to the market, which could increase the availability of properties in the coming months. House builders have also reported more activity, from extremely low levels of construction during the financial crisis. Builder Persimmon said on Wednesday that it had sold more than 3,000 homes under the first phase of the government's Help to Buy equity loan scheme, which was launched in April. The second phase of the Help to Buy scheme has raised fears of a UK housing bubble. This concern was echoed when, a week ago, the Nationwide Building Society said prices across the UK were 5.8% higher than a year ago. However, the Halifax said that prices and activity remained below the peak of 2006-07. Meanwhile estate agents have said the bubble warning is misplaced. "In many areas of the UK, as the Halifax reminds us, house prices remain significantly below their 2007 peak. In some areas, they're still falling. For anyone inside the M25, this is easily forgotten," said Joseph Murrock of estate agent Wesold.co.uk. "London is at risk of overheating, few can realistically deny that, but what is happening in the capital is hugely distorting the image of the broader UK market." </body>

      <body>Parents are buying more toys with a price tag of over £50 as electronic devices continue to be a hit with youngsters, analysts suggest. Sales of these more expensive toys have grown by 6% in the year to mid-October compared with the same period a year earlier, the NPD Group said. This came despite a 1% drop in total UK toy sales over the same period. The figures were published as the industry revealed its predictions for the most popular toys for Christmas. Pre-school tablet devices - The InnoTab 3S and the LeapPad Ultra - have made the annual Dream Toys list released by the UK Toy Retailers' Association (TRA). They form part of an £80m market in children's tablets that will reach more than one million sales by the end of the year, according to Frederique Tutt, a global toy industry analyst at NPD. That means greater costs for parents, despite a financial squeeze for many families. "In the UK, as in the rest of Europe, people are influenced by a difficult economic climate. Impulse toy-buying for instance is experiencing significant declines," said Ms Tutt. "However, in this environment of cautious consumerism, our research shows that items with high price tags sell very well, especially good quality brands and innovative concepts." The leading toys this year have been named by the TRA as: Toy sales have fallen in general this year, according to Ms Tutt, owing to a combination of post-Olympics sales declines, poor outdoor toy sales during bad weather in the spring, and the absence of a summer film blockbuster with linked toys. </body>

      <body>UK industrial production increased more than expected in September, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Industrial output increased by 0.9% between August and September, above economists' predictions of 0.5%. Output in September was 2.2% higher compared with the same period a year ago, marking the strongest annual growth since January 2011. The industrial sector makes up about a sixth of the UK economy. Increased productivity in manufacturing, mining, quarrying, and water management contributed to September's growth. Manufacturing saw a 1.2% rise in output between August and September, with UK companies making more pharmaceuticals, transport equipment, computers, and electronics, the ONS said. September's growth lies in contrast to August, where industrial output fell unexpectedly, showing its biggest decline for nearly a year. </body>

      <title>Eurozone data shows fragile growth</title>
      <description>New figures on retail sales and purchasing by companies underline that the eurozone's economic recovery remains fragile.</description>

      <body>Further evidence of the eurozone's fragile economic recovery came on Wednesday in two sets of data. Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency, said retail sales in the 17-nation bloc fell 0.6% in September from August. Meanwhile, Markit's composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.9 points in October from 52.2 in September. The reading was, however, still above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The sets of data came a day before the European Central Bank (ECB) is due to announce its latest decision on interest rates. September is the final month of the third quarter, so Eurostat's retail data could impact on official quarterly GDP figures. The eurozone emerged from an 18-month recession in the second quarter with growth of 0.3%, but other recent data has also pointed to a slowdown in the pace of growth. Howard Archer, chief economist at Global Insight, said: "September's relapse in retail sales fuels suspicion that consumers across the eurozone will likely remain pretty cautious in their spending in the near term. "Significantly, retail sales fell back sharply in Portugal - by 6.2% month-on-month - and Spain - by 2.5% month-on-month - in September". And he added: "German consumers have been generally reluctant overall to significantly step up their spending on a sustained basis in an uncertain environment." 'Pressure' Markit's PMI reading of 51.9 for October is an upward revision of an initial 'flash' estimate of 51.5 points published last month. But it was still down from September's 27-month high. Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson, said the "loss of momentum raises concerns that the upturn is faltering". He said that data, coming a day after the European Commission downgraded its 2014 eurozone growth forecast to 1.1% from 1.2%, would make for sober reading at the ECB. The survey, based on some 5,000 firms in the single currency area, "piles pressure" on the ECB "to reinvigorate the recovery," especially with "concerns about deflation taking hold," he said. </body>

      <title>Downton Abbey 'can help UK business'</title>
      <description>The popularity of the Royal Family and the TV drama Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers are told.</description>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <title>Tesco to use face-scan ad targeting</title>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all of its 450 forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, from Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <body>More than 400,000 people have lost Jobseeker's Allowance under new government sanctions aimed at ensuring they actively seek work. Some 580,000 sanctions were handed down between October 2012 and June 2013, a 6% rise on the same period a year earlier, before rules were toughened. Reasons for withdrawal of the benefit range from leaving a job voluntarily to failing to attend an interview. The government said the sanctions were used as a deterrent. The latest figures have been published by the Department for Work and Pensions. The new sanctions were introduced on 22 October 2012. If a comparison is made between November 2012 and June 2013 and the same period a year earlier, then there was an 11% rise in sanctions. In the most extreme cases, individuals can lose the benefit for three years if, for example, they leave three jobs voluntarily. There are three levels to the new sanctions: The latest figures showed that 53% of decisions to withdraw benefit were the result of the lowest level sanction, while 38% were intermediate sanctions and 9% the highest level sanction. About a third of cases related to people failing to actively seek work, with slightly fewer related to people who failed to participate in the government's Work Programme - a flagship government scheme of work experience for jobseekers - or failing to attend training. About one in five cases were the result of somebody failing to attend an interview with an adviser. In total, 223,000 people have so far received the lowest sanction, while 167,000 have been hit with the intermediate sanction and 48,000 with the highest sanction. Employment Minister Esther McVey said that people were paid Jobseeker's Allowance only if they were doing all they could to look for a job. She said these sanctions were only used against those who were "wilfully rejecting support for no good reason". However, there has been criticism of the sanctions from some people who believe they have been used against them unfairly. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, has also criticised the way the system operates. "When you're already struggling to make ends meet whilst looking for work, a sanction ends up being an extra obstacle to the huge challenge of getting a job," she said. "The regime is not only self-defeating, it is also poorly administered." Tim Nichols, of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: "Sanctions are meant to have a positive effect on behaviour, so if the system was working, their use would be falling, as claimants develop positive relationships with job centre and Work Programme advisers and do all the activities needed. "Instead, the system has become an unhelpful bureaucratic nightmare, with job centres setting targets to arbitrarily push up the numbers of people hit with a sanction." Separate figures from the DWP showed that the number of claimants of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) who have been sanctioned stood at 9,000 between October and June. They were hit by more than 11,000 sanctions, similar to the figure for the whole of the previous year to the end of May 2012, when 11,130 ESA sanctions were applied. </body>

      <title>Investors warned over carbon scam</title>
      <description>Small investors, particularly the elderly, are warned by ministers to avoid a scam involving carbon credits, after more than 1,000 are duped out of a total of £24m.</description>

      <body>Small investors, particularly the elderly, have been warned to avoid a scam involving carbon credits, after more than 1,000 people were duped out of a total of £24m. Financial firms operating the ploy sold investment in the credits, a permit that allows a company to emit carbon dioxide, but can also be traded. The market in trading carbon credits is not accessible to small investors. The government's Insolvency Service has closed down 19 companies involved. The Consumer Minister, Jo Swinson, said: "This is a particularly disgraceful scam as it not only preyed on older people trying to maximise their savings, but also targeted their sincere desire to make ethical investments. Instead, investors have been left out of pocket with shares that are either worthless or do not exist." One 90-year-old-man told the BBC how he had been pressurised two years ago to spend £60,000 of his retirement savings on carbon credits - which can be virtually worthless and are a mystery to most people, according to the BBC's personal finance correspondent Simon Gompertz. The sales agents travelled from London to Cheshire to make the sale, but he never received paperwork and feels he was targeted because he was elderly. He said: "They came to see me at Macclesfield station, and had a drink... I was very impressed, why should they come all the way from London? "I should have been suspicious, if they're going to those lengths they must have something unique." The man told the BBC he had "invested" £20,000 on European carbon credits and £40,000 on Californian carbon credits. Some of the 1,500 victims were told their carbon credits would be then bought by British Airways and Marks and Spencer. However, the two companies were not involved at all and the investors were left high and dry. Most investors found there was no market for the relatively small amounts they held - as companies that trade in carbon credits only deal in high volumes. The companies included Eco Global Markets Limited, which alone took at least £8.5m from more than 230 investors. It was wound up by the Insolvency Service in July 2013. Two other companies, Anglo-Capital Partners Ltd and Cavendish Jacobs Ltd, which between them took over £1.2m, were wound up in October 2013. Caroline Abrahams, charity director for Age UK, said: "It is despicable that these companies seem to home in on older people as an easy target . "Scams can take place on the doorstep, by phone, on the internet or through the post and the sad fact is that if something sounds too good to be true then it probably is." She advised people who were suspicious of investment offers to take their time to think, and to talk to others, including the police if they thought they had fallen victim to a scam. Age UK has two free information guides: "Avoiding Scams" and "Staying Safe", which provide practical steps to ensure older people are able to protect themselves against this type of crime in their home and on their doorstep. </body>

      <title>Disabled people win living fund case</title>
      <description>Five disabled people win a legal challenge to the government's decision to abolish a fund helping 19,000 severely disabled people to live independently.</description>

      <body>Five disabled people have succeeded in a legal challenge to the government's decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund. The £320m ILF currently provides support enabling nearly 19,000 severely disabled people in the UK to live independent lives in the community. The High Court ruled in April that the closure decision was lawful, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. The government said it was considering whether to contest the judgement. During the Court of Appeal hearing, the five argued the High Court had misinterpreted the law and there had been a lack of proper consultation by ministers over the changes. They said that, without ILF funding and support, they would be forced into residential care or lose their ability to participate in work and everyday activities on the same basis as able-bodied people. The scheme's average payout is £300 a week, and the government has said councils, which administer most social care, will take over funding this help. Ministers took the decision close the fund on 18 December last year. Court of Appeal judges Lord Justice Elias, Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice McCombe allowed the challenge to the High Court's earlier ruling, quashing the original decision in favour of the government. Lord Justice McCombe said the evidence upon which the decision had been based had not given "an adequate flavour of the responses received indicating that independent living might well be put seriously in peril for a large number of people". The disabled applicants feared that the decision to close the fund and devolve the money to local authorities would lead to a reduction, or even loss, of that money, which had previously effectively been ring-fenced. Welcoming the "powerful" ruling, law firms Deighton Pierce-Glynn and Scott-Moncrieff and Associates, which represented the claimants, said their clients had "feared that the loss of their ILF support would threaten their right to live with dignity, and that they could be forced into residential care or lose their ability to work and participate in everyday activities on an equal footing with other people". The Court of Appeal decision was described as being "of major importance not just for the claimants, but for all disabled people". Minister for Disabled People Mike Penning said: "We are very pleased the Court of Appeal upheld how we undertook our consultation on the future of the fund, and they accepted that it had been carried out properly and fairly. "We are disappointed with certain aspects of today's decision, and we will be examining the judgement very carefully and considering the implications before deciding on the most appropriate way forward, which includes seeking leave to appeal." The prime minister's official spokesman added that the Department for Work and Pensions was "now considering that judgement". The Equality and Human Rights Commission was permitted by the court to intervene in the case and made submissions on the proper application of the Equality Act and UN Convention. The ILF was established in 1988, but the government decided in 2010 that it had become "no longer appropriate or sustainable" to keep running the scheme outside the mainstream social care system. The fund closed to new applicants soon afterwards. </body>

      <title>Strike brings Greece to a halt</title>

      <body>Workers in Greece are holding a 24-hour general strike over continuing cuts as international lenders decide whether to unlock further bailout money. Flights and other transport are being disrupted by action in both the public and private sectors, and schools and hospitals are also affected. But torrential rain in Athens has limited public protests, with both main unions cancelling their rallies. Greece has held more than 30 general strikes since early 2010. Unemployment stands at nearly 28% after massive public sector cuts and tax rises to reduce its fiscal deficit. Greece has been granted two bailouts totalling about 240bn euros (£202bn; $323bn) to help cover holes in its financing, and there is speculation it will need a third package of at least 11bn euros next year. At issue just now is the latest instalment from the second bailout, worth 1bn euros. The payment must be approved by the troika of lenders: the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The troika says there is a budget gap of 2.5bn euros for next year that may require more austerity but the government argues the country cannot take any more. Greece has predicted that it will emerge from its six-year long recession next year, in a sign it may be finally recovering from its debt crisis. However, recovery for Europe's sick man remains a slow and painful process that could yet take years to achieve, the BBC's Mark Lowen reports from Athens. Two separate protest marches to parliament in Athens were called off due to bad weather. But smaller groups of mainly Communist Party supporters still braved the driving rain, according to reports. Meanwhile thousands of people marched in Greece's second city Thessaloniki. Ferry, rail and some air services are still being disrupted by Wednesday's action. Air traffic controllers have stopped work for several hours. "Workers, pensioners and the unemployed are going through an endless nightmare," port workers said in a statement. "The government and the troika are destroying this country." The public sector union Adedy said in a statement: "United we can stop them, we can topple them." When troika auditors arrived at the finance ministry in Athens on Tuesday, a protester flung coins at its leader, Poul Thomsen. The attacker was arrested but reportedly later released. </body>

      <body>A court in Ivory Coast has sentenced 15 former top officials to 20 years each in prison for embezzling hundreds of thousands of dollars from the cocoa and coffee industry. The 15, popularly known as "cocoa barons", were also ordered to pay fines worth $138m (£86m). They were convicted of embezzling tax revenues during the rule of former President Laurent Gbagbo. Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa. At least 13 others were acquitted at the trial in the main city of Abidjan. The accused were arrested in 2008 after Mr Gbagbo ordered the investigation into allegations of widespread corruption in the coffee and cocoa sectors. Mr Gbagbo disputed the result of elections in November 2010, which the UN said he had lost, and refused to leave office resulting in a five-month stand-off. Forces loyal to current President Alassane Ouattara, backed by UN and French troops, captured Mr Gbagbo in April 2011. He is now in detention at The Hague awaiting trial on four charges of crimes against humanity, which he denies. The conflict badly affected Ivory Coast's cocoa industry, which accounts for 40% of global supplies of the natural raw ingredient used in chocolate. </body>

      <body>Indonesia's economy expanded at its weakest rate in four years in the third quarter as a result of slowing exports and subdued domestic demand. Its economy grew 5.6% in the July-to-September period from a year earlier, down from 5.8% in the previous quarter. Indonesia's exports have been hurt by slowing demand from key markets and a drop in commodity prices. Meanwhile, domestic demand has been impacted by rising fuel prices and rising interest rates. Fuel prices in the country surged earlier this year after the government removed its subsidy programme. Petrol prices went up by 44% while diesel prices rose by 22%, leading to higher transportation costs and electricity bills. Indonesia, like many other emerging economies, was also hurt after investors withdrew money from emerging markets earlier this year. The pullout was triggered by growing speculation that the US central bank will start to taper off its key stimulus programme and start raising interest rates sooner than previously thought. In Indonesia's case, concerns of slowing economic growth and a widening current account deficit further contributed to that pull out. All of this has hurt the Indonesian currency which has dipped nearly 17% against the US dollar since May this year. A weak currency coupled with rising consumer prices has resulted in the central bank raising the cost of borrowing in the country. The latest raise in September saw the key rate rise to 7.25%, the highest level in more than four years. Analysts said that the combination of all these factors had hurt domestic consumption and impacted growth. In September, the country's central bank also lowered its growth forecast.

      <title>The Wall Street boss glad she was sacked</title>

      <body>Sallie Krawcheck used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street - before two very public sackings at the height of the financial collapse. Now the head of women's networking organisation 85 Broads, she says she's grateful she was fired. From 2007-2011, Ms Krawcheck held prominent roles at banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Those positions made her, arguably, the highest ranking woman on Wall Street. But, at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, she had very public clashes with Vikram Pandit, the then chief executive of Citigroup, over her insistence that the bank should repay investors who had lost money using defective financial instruments that Citi had created. Eventually, she was forced out - a fate that would once again befall her, just a few years later, after taking on the role of chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America. Although those firings certainly stung, they gave Ms Krawcheck an epiphany - she felt that in times of distress, companies react by closing ranks, and diversity, particularly gender diversity, suffers. "What I saw a thousand times during the downturn was, 'We'd like to give her that opportunity, but we need to go with the sure thing - we can't afford diversity right now,'" she says. So now, as the boss of 85 Broads, Ms Krawcheck says her goal is to work in a more active way to correct the gender imbalance at the top. Ms Krawcheck bought 85 Broads for an undisclosed fee from its founder, Janet Hanson, in May. Created by a group of women who worked at Goldman Sachs' former headquarters at 85 Broad Street, it was initially created to mentor women in the bank. Now, it's exploded to a membership organisation with more than 30,000 paid subscribers from 130 countries. Ms Krawcheck is candid in acknowledging that her purchase surprised many people. "For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way," she wrote in a post announcing her purchase. "My standard response: 'Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I'm just focused on getting the job done.'" However, she says her first job - as a research analyst at Solomon Brothers in the 1980s - taught her to invest in what is supported by research. And she says research shows that "women are a phenomenal investment and that is true in almost any way you can define it". Ms Krawcheck cites data showing that companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity. However, despite those statistics, she thinks that gender diversity - particularly in the financial services industry - has stalled, mostly as a result of the fallout from the financial crisis. "During periods of stress, it's easier for all of us to be with people like ourselves," she says about Wall Street's behaviour during that time. "But eventually it becomes a shortcut." She thinks that as a result of this impulse to push out outsiders, bad decisions can often get made. "What I saw was a good deal of groupthink [during the financial collapse]," she says. "The same people, same types of backgrounds, looking at the same data coming to the same conclusion - which in this case was wrong." During that time, she adds, she was "talked at" a couple of times - but not necessarily listened to. She says that her goal at 85 Broads is to listen to the membership to figure out ways to convince Wall Street bosses and other large organisations that gender diversity is crucial to their success - that in times of stress, instead of closing ranks, companies should look for an outsider perspective. Furthermore, she wants to expand the mission of 85 Broads to invest in companies helmed by some of its members or by other powerful women. Ms Krawcheck is candid that while her two firings helped her crystallise what she wanted to do as an executive, it certainly wasn't easy to fall so swiftly, twice. "In my mind, I sat on my sofa in my sweatpants for nine months and waited for the phone to ring," says Ms Krawcheck, about the time after she was sacked by Citigroup. But she says she is grateful for both the highs - and the lows. "I've had a lot of ups and some downs and people have asked about how I've weathered them," she says. "I know for a lot of entrepreneurs there's a sense of optimism [in being boss of your own company]. I'd say the more overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude." </body>

      <title>Si Shen: Rebuilding Papaya Mobile</title>
      <description>Games entrepreneur Si Shen of Papaya Mobile explains why all start-ups need to have more than one platform for their products</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24749575</url>

      <body>Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families? One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of PapayaMobile, which produces games for mobile phones. Si Shen was born and grew up in China. Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot. Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise. When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist. But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas. Her mother's example influenced her heavily. Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. "He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.' And because of this dream, he changed the world." She remembers thinking: "That's so cool! I want to do something like that!" Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California. By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company. At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur. He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first. Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal. At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time. She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying "I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company." She got the job. After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008. They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market. After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise. At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular. Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone. The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point. "All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users." Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store. As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on. The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion. "Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.' That was a very serious situation," she remembers. "I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees. Everybody was looking at me every day. They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer." She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area. Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games. "Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone," she recalls. She was devastated. Her investors pulled out and she knew she had to do something fast. She quickly decided to take the risk of moving Papaya's games to a different mobile phone system, Google's Android platform. She took the chance because although Android was just getting established at the time, she knew "it was going to be big". Her bet paid off. Papaya's games proved popular on phones running the Android system. Later, after making some technical changes, the company's games were allowed back on sale through Apple's App Store. Ms Shen says she learnt a lot from the episode, gaining a better understanding of how the business world works and the dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket. "As a start-up, you cannot just rely on one platform, because one day if that platform tells you 'no', then you lose everything. You have to have back-up." She has also learned a lot about herself. Until then her whole business experience had been very smooth, and she had not known "the taste of failure". "That taught me that no matter what happens, if you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome." </body>

      <title>Australia's small farmers struggling with low prices</title>
      <description>Despite a bumper crop of spring produce, Australia's farmers are struggling against low prices, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>

      <body>A near-perfect growing season for small farmers in two of Australia's biggest food belt regions - south-east Queensland and Victoria - has produced a bumper crop. But despite a bountiful yield, there is a nasty sting for numerous family-run farms as oversupply has driven down prices. It should be a time for celebration for growers, who have become hardened to a relentless cycle of droughts and floods in recent years. Instead many are complaining that they are being paid less at wholesale markets than the cost of harvesting their crops. At Peak Crossing, south-west of Brisbane, Wayne Allum saw part of his 10-acre (four-hectare) property disappear under murky brown floodwaters last year, but has now enjoyed textbook weather conditions following a mild Antipodean winter. Yet still he frets about his financial future. "It's a hard game sending your stuff to the markets and then not knowing what you're going to get for it. It is stressful and disheartening," says the former truck driver, who grows tomatoes, lettuces, cabbages, courgettes, and spring onions. "Prices were terrible compared to what it costs you to grow them, get them picked, grade them, box them and send them to the markets," he adds. "I won't send my stuff to the markets any more." Instead, he sells his produce from the back of a truck parked under the shade of a jacaranda tree on the main road to take advantage of passing trade. "It's not a huge living," says Mr Allum. "I'm better off just growing what I can, do everything myself and just sell it at the farm for a profit and make a living that way." The number of farmers in Australia is shrinking, and it's not just the current domestic oversupply that is hurting the bottom line. The amount of imported fresh produce has reached record levels, and Mark Vogler, owner of the Aratula Markets in Queensland, says growers are facing unfair competition from overseas imports, which he says are of lesser standard. Mr Vogler sells fruit and vegetables from local farms and wants prices to be set by the federal government to guarantee those on the land a decent return. If not, he believes the sector will continue to contract. "To see how fast the farms are going backwards has been alarming," he adds. "The Australian public doesn't know about it yet. The problem is once we do lose the ability to feed our people locally, we'll have to rely on produce that has come in from overseas unregulated." Ausveg, the industry body representing 9,000 of Australia's vegetable and potato growers, which generates about 4bn Australian dollars ($3.8bn; £2.4bn) per year, believes that financial security for its members lies far beyond the horizon. Australian carrots are an unlikely hit in Singapore and the Middle East, along with asparagus, humble fresh potatoes and leafy greens. Last year, just 7% of Australia's fresh fruit and vegetables were exported, but Hugh Gurney from Ausveg wants that to change. "There is a lot of product entering the market, and it makes it tough for growers to get a decent price for their product," he says. "As a result the Australian vegetable industry is looking more and more to overseas markets to supply fresh produce to Asia and hopefully relieve some of the oversupply in the domestic market." Yet Australia is so big that conditions for growers vary immensely, as do the triumphs and challenges, including October's bushfires in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, where some of the worst bushfires seen in New South Wales tore across vast swathes of forest and farmland. Perched off the southern coast is the "apple isle" of Tasmania, so nicknamed because it has long produced large crops of the fruit. The island of course grows many other crops, and artisan farming has blossomed on the island state in recent years, where small enterprises beaver away making high-value, niche specialities, including hand-ground spelt rye flour along with boutique jams and relishes. Crucially, the industry has established direct links to the public, according to Jan Davis, chief executive of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. "The thing that our small farmers do very, very well here in Tasmania is build on that relationship directly with consumers. So we've got a very strong farmers' market and farm gate sector down here," she says. Tasmanian farmers are also leading the way on exporting extensively. "We have product going right across the globe into Asia, Europe and the Americas. Just about anywhere you can think of there is Tasmanian product on a table somewhere," Jan Davis adds. But Tasmania's optimism gives way to a sense of gloom in other parts of Australia. In Queensland's sugar capital, Bundaberg, Mark Presser, a fourth generation cane farmer, enjoyed a record crop last year, and is on course to harvest another reasonable yield this time around. Yet he too feels besieged by falling prices and growing competition from overseas, most notably Brazil and India, where production costs are far less. He also complains about protectionism in Europe and the US. "Some days you wonder why you are doing it. We've got that much money tied up (in the business) we just can't walk away," says the 47-year old farmer, who owns 270 acres (110 hectares) of land. "The majority of the people who live in the big cities have got no idea at all how hard it is," he adds. He warns about the fate of other family-owned operators. "There aren't too many little ones left," he says. "They are just standing on the edge of the precipice and are on borrowed time." </body>

      <body>Rangers have announced that David Somers has been appointed as independent non-executive director and acting chairman of the club's board. The club have also confirmed that their annual general meeting (AGM) will take place on Thursday 19 December. The chairmanship has been vacant since Walter Smith left the role in August. Rangers say Somers will "oversee the process of appointing a high calibre chief executive officer and further independent non-executive director(s)". Craig Mather left the role of chief executive last month with Bryan Smart also stepping down as non-executive director. Following the departures of Mather, Smart, Smith and non-executive director Ian Hart, finance director Brian Stockbridge and James Easdale were the only board members left. Rangers, who reported a £14m operating loss for the the 13 months to June, were due to hold their AGM last month but it was delayed after a group of shareholders seeking boardroom changes were granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session. That group want former chairman Malcolm Murray as well as Paul Murray, Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson appointed as directors - proposals that must be on the AGM agenda following the court decision. In a statement to the stock exchange, Rangers described 65-year-old Somers as "a qualified accountant" who has "spent all his career in fund management and in addition has considerable experience in matters of corporate governance". The club say they hope that Somers will "form a unified board and provide stability for Rangers". "In order to allow time for the process outlined above to be progressed, the company will hold its annual general meeting on Thursday 19 December," read the Rangers statement. "Mr Somers will, in accordance with Rangers' Articles of Association, be subject to re-appointment by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders at the AGM." The statement went on to outline Somers' current partnerships and directorships with Ace Europe Life Ltd, Europe Arab Bank plc, FRS Pension Trustee Company and TCF Investments Limited. </body>

      <title>Sayers wins funding after appeal</title>
      <description>British javelin record-holder Goldie Sayers appeals successfully against a decision to deny her lottery funding.</description>

      <body>British javelin record-holder Goldie Sayers will receive lottery funding after successfully appealing against her omission from the initial list. The 31-year-old from Cambridgeshire was a bronze medallist at Beijing in 2008, but suffered an elbow injury last year. "I'm delighted my appeal was successful," Sayers said. "I was naturally disappointed not to be included first time around but nonetheless I'm even more determined to make 2014 and beyond a success." Sayers broke her own British record at a Diamond League meeting shortly before London 2012, but tore elbow ligaments in the process. A repeat of her record throw of 66.17m would have been good enough to win silver at last year's Olympics, but the injury ruined her medal chances and she failed to qualify for the final. UK Sport provides lottery funding for athletes, but decisions about who should receive it are taken by British Athletics. They changed the criteria for the next allocation period, so that only athletes considered realistic medal contenders for the Rio 2016 Olympics are eligible for 'podium' funding. Previously, funding awards were made to those thought likely to qualify for finals. In her appeal, Sayers, who has recovered from multiple surgeries and is in winter training, successfully convinced officials she still has the ability to challenge for medals. "I'm now back on the right path after surgery and back in full training after a successful period of rehab," she said. "I am now preparing for the Commonwealth Games and the European Championships next year." British Athletics performance director Neil Black said: "Goldie presented a very strong case for her inclusion on the World Class Performance Programme. "The panel reviewed their original decision after being presented with Goldie's appeal submission and a decision was made to include her on the World Class Performance Programme for 2013-14." </body>

      <title>Soccerex axe stokes World Cup fears</title>
      <description>Fears about disruption to next year's World Cup are raised as the key global football conference Soccerex is cancelled by the Rio authorities.</description>

      <body>Fears about disruption to next year's World Cup have been raised after the key global football conference Soccerex was cancelled for disputed reasons. Soccerex organisers said Rio de Janeiro's state government had called off next month's event due to concerns about "ongoing civil unrest" in Brazil. However the government "strongly denied" that this was the reason, instead citing a funding dispute. The Soccerex gathering was due to be held at Rio's Maracana stadium. The England manager, Roy Hodgson, was among a number of high-profile figures who were planning to attend the event. Rio's state government said Soccerex, run by a British company, had failed to raise sufficient private funds to cover the cost of the three-day conference, and that it was not prepared to put forward any public money to fill the gap. "The state guarantees the security of multiple events, including New Year's Eve on Copacabana beach, carnival, and the World Cup," it said in a statement. "The government of Rio de Janeiro encouraged the organisers to seek cultural and sports incentives [funding] and they failed to do so. Soccerex were advised to seek funding to host the event so that the state would not have to use public money." The event would have been the last of four scheduled Soccerex conventions to be held in Rio. The organisers said they would be taking legal action against the Rio authorities responsible. "Preparations for the event at the Maracana Stadium were well advanced with content planned, speakers confirmed and partnerships in place," a statement said. "To be summarily cancelled in such a cavalier fashion, having hosted 33 events over five continents is extremely frustrating but nevertheless it has happened and is in contravention of all of the contractual obligations of the Rio state government, who have been notified of our intention to instigate legal proceedings for substantial compensation." Soccerex chief executive Duncan Revie called the cancellation "cruel" and said he wanted to apologise to "every business, football club, league, federation and media organisation affected by this news". Despite the sudden cancellation, world football governing body Fifa said it did not suggest heightened security fears for the World Cup. Fifa's marketing director, Thierry Weil, said: "We do not believe this will have any influence in any way or form on the organisation of the Fifa World Cup." Brazil, one of the fast-growing Brics nations, has seen its growth rate fall far from the 7.5% recorded in 2010 and is now growing at just short of 3% a year. That, and a sharp fall in the value of its currency, the real, has sparked a number of often violent anti-government protests this year. Among the protesters' concerns are corruption in public life as well as spending on hosting the World Cup and Olympics. People are also asking for more investment in public services, better public schools, hospitals and transportation. These demonstrations affected the Confederations Cup in June, prompting fears about safety and security for next summer's World Cup finals. Soccerex has been running for the last 18 years. It brings together football federations and associations, major clubs, rights holders, leading brands, businessmen and others in the industry. Next year it moves to Manchester in the UK, which has been the host of Soccerex Europe since 2010. </body>

      <title>Twitter: It's worth how much?!</title>
      <description>How do you value a company like Twitter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24819238</url>
      <date>1383782700</date>

      <body>Twitter's much-anticipated launch on to the markets is fizzing with fanfare and debate over how - given that it has never made money - the microblogging site, priced at $26 per share, is officially worth more than $18bn (£11bn). The facts seem to contradict themselves. Twitter's growth is slow, and it shows no sign of making a profit - its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier. And more than half of its total registered users don't even use it. But some analysts predict that in the months post-share sale, the seven-year-old company's worth will increase to $20bn and beyond. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than double the likes of global carmaker Fiat, with its very modest-sounding market capitalisation of 6.9bn euros ($9.3bn). But Twitter is not alone in its sector when it comes to big price tags, if not profits. Online "scrapbooking" website Pinterest was valued at $3.8bn in October after its latest round of investment, giving it the same value, in terms of market capitalisation, as the UK's second largest house-builder Barratt Homes. Yet while Barratt has reported a full-year pre-tax profit of £192m for 2012-13, Pinterest has never made any money. Its digital "pinboards" may be attracting users, there may be talk of advertisers paying for posts, but it has no revenue yet. So why do these social media companies have this value attached to them? Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told the BBC it was a bit like buying a house. "You look at what other people are paying for something a little bit like what you are buying," he said. "[But] you have to think about whether you are going to price [the company] or value it." Twitter, Mr Damodaran believes, is being priced by bankers and brokers - not valued - and that pricing is coming from comparing it to its peers. By this he means that value is something more complex and emotional, but that pricing is based on at-the-time comparisons. Most notably, with Facebook. "The big difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook was making money [when it launched its IPO in 2012] and Twitter is losing money," said Mr Damodaran. Facebook had a billion active users when it launched its shares. While Twitter is growing its user base rapidly - up 39% over the past year to 500 million - only 232 million of these are active each month. According to a recent report by analysts Pew Internet, 72% of internet users in the US use social networking sites, but just 18% use Twitter. Plus, while users are invited to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters, many do not engage on the platform at all, leaving their registered accounts dormant. Others prefer to simply follow news feeds and favourite celebrities instead. This can cut the amount of time people spend on the site, and in turn the opportunities for advertisers to catch their attention. Facebook's IPO famously ran far from smoothly, and its shares quickly halved in price, before recovering slowly over the next two years. "Twitter is also entering a more crowded market than Facebook," said Mr Damodaran, "and there are many more queuing up to join." Therefore, he added, Twitter should be valued at about $10-15bn. He wrote recently that "at $20 billion, it is a moon shot". Chris Orndorff, who manages billions of dollars for clients at Los Angeles-based Western Asset Management, believes value is a lot to do with cash flow. "One of the best ways to value a company is to figure out the present value of the cash flows," he said. "For a more mature company, this is easier to do because they have a history of earnings, and generally reliable predictions about future earnings and cash flows. "Relatively new companies do not have the history." Therefore, he added, the stock was more likely to be volatile. "The susceptibility of social media companies to changes in consumer tastes also makes valuing those companies much more challenging," he said. Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of the travel website Lastminute.com, told the BBC she was confident Twitter could make money and hold its value. "Yes it is a scrabble for revenue," she said, but the company "has an astonishing amount of money in the bank". Advertising income from mobiles, rather than desktop computers, now accounts for over 70% of advertising revenue, and here, believes Ms Lane Fox and others, Twitter may be able to flourish. She also predicted "a huge number of interesting deals and partnerships" that could boost it further. A lot of the "value" or pricing of these companies depends on a future demand for services, as well as possible advertising streams. But, as past deals demonstrate - that future isn't always predictable. Famously, ITV bought the website Friends Reunited for £175m in 2005, but in 2009 Brightsolid paid ITV just £25m for the site. It had been superseded. Its "value" had been eroded. Its customers, the key to any company, had, in large numbers, moved on. Similar problems were encountered at one of the early social media pioneers, MySpace. In 2005 News Corp purchased MySpace for $580m. When it was sold in 2011, its price tag had fallen to a reported $35m. It too had been overtaken, and users abandoned its offering. But, for San Francisco-based CBS technology analyst Larry Magid, these cautionary tales make the newer clutch of technology companies stronger. "MySpace is a constant reminder that a high and mighty service can lose its lustre. However, the lessons of MySpace were not lost on Facebook, Twitter and services that followed," he said. "I think the difference [now] is the execution and the demographics. To succeed, Twitter needs a diversified audience that transcends a particular demographic. MySpace was focused on youth - a particularly fickle audience." Mr Damodaran said: "A lot of very valuable companies today - including Google - were once small, money-losing companies." And Mr Orndorff agreed: "The valuation is reasonable if the company can continue to grow its user base, generate cash flow from advertising, and successfully fend off the competition. If not, then it will be remembered - or forgotten - like many of the 1998-99 tech bubble companies, and generate plenty of tax losses for investors." </body>

      <body>There is a widely held belief that women are generally better than men at developing and maintaining relationships. But many women seem unable to transfer those skills to the business world, where the same activity is commonly called "networking". "Part of the cause is that women value authenticity in relationships," says Deborah Gillis, chief operating officer for Catalyst, a women's business research and advocacy group. "Sometimes the notion of meeting someone and then looking to them for help, or advice, or contacts in business, often feels just a little uncomfortable. Men seem to do it much more naturally." Experts have various explanations as to why this might be, but they are agreed on one important point - informal networks are critical to success, and more women need to learn how to benefit from them. "Women need to think about networking as a business skill," says Ms Gillis. "And just as we would focus our attention on developing other skills that are important to our success, we should spend time and care in building our confidence and ability to network effectively." But becoming a part of informal groups - especially those dominated by men - can be difficult, as technology blogger and consultant Vanessa Fox discovered when she left Google to start her own company in Seattle. As one of the industry's few female experts on search engine optimisation, she had to overcome both professional and social barriers - and that meant learning how to play poker. "I would go to these poker games, and I was always the only woman there," she says. "It's not that the men exclude women - they actually invited me - it's that women either don't know about [these activities], or they're intimidated. "I think they have this idea that men can automatically play poker. But actually men can't play poker either, and a lot of women I know are really good at math - more so than the guys." But the game itself isn't as important as the conversations that naturally develop, she says. "They tell you what their start-up does and what they're doing, and so you get to know people. And because of my experience, a lot of these guys then want to meet up with me because they want my advice - and that's when you start to build relationships outside of the more formal events." Ms Fox is the first to point out that such an approach isn't for everybody, but adds that she had little choice. "I've had to join men's networks because that's what was out there," she says. "The tech start-up world happens to be mostly men, and it happens that they want to play poker. "They're not actively saying they're going to try to find a thing that women don't like - they just want to have a good time." Sport has also become a popular networking tool for women. "If you can speak sport, talk sport, in an authoritative way where you actually watch it, and follow the game and you're passionate about it, it allows you to be one of the gang and gets you into the circle you can't get into any other way," says Susan Spencer, a former manager at American football team Philadelphia Eagles. She says sport offers a "safe" subject for women to talk about with their male counterparts. Ms Spencer adds: "If you go out for drinks you don't want to talk about politics, that's a deadly one, you're not going to do boy talk with a load of sexual innuendoes because that takes you down a road you don't want to go - it has to be sport!" Jenn Harris has taken the idea a stage further with the launch last year of High-heel Golfer. Based in San Diego, she travels all over the country offering workshops to women who want to use the game to develop better business relationships. "I don't think of the golf course as a man's world. I think of it as a place to learn about someone else," she says. "All the little things that happen are ways to see who that person really is - how do they react after a shot, do they cheat, do they have integrity? You can't get that over drinks at a happy hour." A keen golfer since the age of seven, Ms Harris cites her own experience as proof of the power of golf. While working for a defence contractor she needed to get to know military commanders and other executives who all enjoyed playing. She joined them on the golf course, and attributes her subsequent success to the contacts she made. "I was promoted within nine months, was put on every big project over the next two years, and later, when budget cuts were made, the clients made it known that I shouldn't be fired - all because of that relationship I developed on the golf course," says Ms Harris. But employment expert Jean Martin says that unless women actually enjoy playing golf, the game is unlikely to be much use as a networking tool. "The number one element of a successful informal relationship is that the individuals are true to themselves. So doing something that you're not interested in just to be with people ultimately creates an artificial founding of the relationship," she says. Ms Martin is executive director of human resources at CEB, a global business advisory company with headquarters in Washington DC. She says research has demonstrated that effective networking can increase business performance by 30%. As a result, companies themselves are looking at ways to increase networking opportunities for women that highlights their different interests. "Rather than everyone trying to be the same, all on the golf course together, our data suggests that companies which have a lot of people with a lot of different interests and perspectives are significantly advantaged," she says. However, other studies still often show that professional women need to improve their networking skills. A 2011 report by the Toulouse School of Economics in France concluded that a major factor behind female directors earning 17% less than their male counterparts was the fact they were less good at building a network. The study found that in general the male directors had much larger networks of past acquaintances, while female directors instead focused on a few strong relationships. As she tries to build her own business, Jenn Harris attends five to six networking events every week - but says it's important not to make new contacts if you don't have time to follow them up. Vanessa Fox says she tries to be selective. "It is work for sure, and in my case there are some events that I know I'll hate and I just don't go," she says. "I try to find things that are a little more of a balance that I can enjoy and find valuable." </body>

      <title>Phosphorus: Farming's dirty secret</title>
      <description>The looming fertility crisis you've never heard of</description>

      <body>Is it the biggest looming crisis that you have never heard of? Since 1945, the world's population has tripled to seven billion, and feeding that population has relied increasingly on artificial fertilisers. One of the most important fertilisers - phosphates - comes from an ore that is in limited supply. It is mined, processed and spread on to our fields, whence it is ultimately washed away into the ocean. So what will happen if one day we run out of the stuff? "Crop yields will drop very, very spectacularly," chemist Andrea Sella, of University College, London, told Wednesday's Business Daily programme on the World Service. "We will be in very, very deep trouble. We have to remember that the world's population is growing steadily, and so demand for phosphorus is growing every year." As Andrea explains, phosphorus is essential for life. The element - which is so reactive that it spontaneously combusts in its pure form - is used by plant and animal cells to store energy. It also forms the backbone of DNA, and it is an essential ingredient of our bones and teeth. Farming without it is not a realistic option. While this may sound rather alarming, there are two important caveats. First, the supply of phosphates is forecast to last for many decades, if not centuries, to come. So humanity is at no immediate risk of running out of the means to feed itself, even at the current rate at which it is gobbling up phosphates. Second, one of the biggest problems with phosphates over the past 60 years is arguably that they have been far too cheap and abundant. There has been no incentive to use them sparingly. Only a small fraction is actually absorbed by plants, much is washed off by rain. And this glut of fertilisers being washed into river systems, both phosphates and also nitrates, has created a nasty environmental problem - eutrophication. This is where the abundant nutrients feed algae in rivers and ponds, creating blooms that turn the water green. The algae then dies providing a feast for microbes, which in turn multiply and suck the oxygen out of the water, killing off all the fish and other animal and plant life. It is a common problem in the lower reaches of major rivers such as the Thames and Rhine in Europe, and Yangtze in China. Similar algal blooms occur in our oceans, where large areas - notably the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico - have become "dead zones". Purely from an environmental perspective, the price of phosphates has clearly been too low. Yet this now appears to be changing. The price of phosphate ores has risen fivefold over the past decade as demand, particularly from the developing world, has grown steadily. Meanwhile, the cost of fertiliser production has also risen as the richest, cheapest phosphate seams have already been mined. "Commodities are priced on the cost of extracting the next tonne that you need," says Jeremy Grantham, of US fund managers Grantham Mayo van Otterloo. "It is a hopelessly bad system. "As long as we can mine a vital resource cheaply, we will price it cheaply, and run through the reserves until they become very expensive. And then we'll start to conserve." There are various options: And then there is the sewage option. Why not just capture the phosphorus from our own waste and recycle it? Sweden and Germany have been leading the way. There is also a cottage industry among the eco-friendly in Western countries of "compost toilets". Now the UK's Thames Water is getting in on the act, launching a new "reactor" that turns sewage sludge into nice clean fertiliser pellets. How much of future supply could ultimately be provided by recycling is open to debate - Thames Water says 20% using the current technology. But perhaps the more important point lies in the fact that, as a private-sector company, Thames Water is not acting from the goodness of its heart. It and Canadian partners Ostara, who developed the technology, expect to make a profit from selling the pellets, as well as from saving the cost of cleaning and replacing pipes that have become blocked by a phosphorus-based sediment called struvite. Any benefits, as far as the environment or the long-term sustainable usage of a limited resource are concerned, are but a happy by-product. The important point is that it is the rising price of phosphates that has made it worthwhile to start recycling the stuff. So should we welcome the higher price? Well, it depends who you are. In general, the lower your income, the more of it you spend on food and therefore the more sensitive you are to the higher food bills that might come with more expensive fertilisers. In other words, rising phosphate prices hurt the poor most, which is hardly a recipe for social cohesion. And that goes for whole countries too. As Jeremy Grantham points out, many North African countries depend on food imports, and rising food prices contributed to the discontent behind the 2011 Arab Spring. Ironically, one of those countries is Morocco. Ironically, because by a freak of geography Morocco controls about three-quarters of the world's remaining good quality phosphate reserves. "Morocco has the most impressive quasi-monopoly in the history of man," says Mr Grantham. "It makes oil look unimportant in comparison." That could make Morocco a very rich nation in future, one that the rest of the world will be keen to court. And it gives the country a great responsibility in pricing its product in a way that eventually weans the world off it in a manageable way - much like Saudi Arabia and oil. Ironically, the higher prices that monopolists like to set may actually be what the planet needs. But Morocco's unique position could also make it a centre of intrigue. For example, much of its phosphates are actually located in the territory of Western Sahara. It is occupied by the Moroccan military, which currently has an uneasy ceasefire in place with the local Algerian-backed Saharawi resistance. This poses moral questions for the multinational companies that mine the stuff there, as well as some obvious strategic issues for the rest of the world about securing future food supplies. Mr Grantham points out that half of nearby Mali - admittedly the sparsely populated Saharan half - was recently briefly overrun by militants affiliated with al-Qaeda, and he warns that Morocco itself may one day become the scene of rising social tensions, terrorism, or revolt. "I would almost guarantee to you that the major militaries of this world are well aware of this problem. "They would not allow Morocco to become a hopelessly failed state," he says reassuringly. "You don't want to look forward to the great fertiliser wars of 2042." You can listen to Business Daily on BBC World Service at 08:32 GMT and 15:06 GMT. </body>

      <title>Shipyards face up to the inevitable</title>
      <description>Too many UK shipyards are chasing too few warship orders</description>

      <body>Portsmouth Dockyard has been building ships for the Royal Navy since the 13th Century. It is one of only four yards in the UK capable of producing warships for the Royal Navy - and all are owned and run by BAE Systems. But it had been obvious for years that there is no longer enough work for all of BAE's shipyards. Barrow in Furness is safe because it is the only site that can make submarines. But shipyards in Portsmouth, on the south coast, and Govan and Scotstoun, on the Clyde, have too much capacity between them. At the moment, the yards are busy working on the Royal Navy's two new aircraft carriers, but that work will end possibly two whole years before work is due to start on the Navy's new Type 26 frigates. The frigates are still on the design board and no firm orders have been placed. The current plans are to build 13 ships over a lengthy time period. That just won't provide enough work for three shipyards. Not only that, but there is going to be another defence review in 2015. As one expert said, the idea that we are suddenly going to start building a large number of surface ships for the Royal Navy is a "fantasy". The Royal Navy is due to receive three new long-range patrol vessels. But these are relatively cheap and easy to build and would ease pressure on the rest of the Royal Navy's fleet. They would be used to take on anti-piracy and anti-drug running patrols in the Indian Ocean and the Caribbean. Lost skills Currently, such functions can involve using some of the Navy's most expensive ships, which are massively over-equipped for the job. Portsmouth has always been the shipyard most at risk as a result of the gap in orders, not least because the two yards on the Clyde complement each other. Portsmouth is on its own. At the moment it employs 1,700 people, but 940 are set to go. The remaining staff will now concentrate on ship repairing. But in the wider economy it has been calculated that 32,000 people work in the supply chain for the Portsmouth shipyard, a supply chain that has an advanced and specialised industrial engineering skill-set that has now lost its biggest local customer and will have to find orders from elsewhere. </body>

      <title>Online retailers move into High Streets</title>
      <description>The online retailers coming to a High Street near you</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24728406</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70849000/jpg/_70849766_clicksbecclarke.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>With the inexorable rise of online shopping, there have been gloomy predictions about the future of the bricks and mortar, High Street store. Yet it seems that reports of its imminent demise may have been exaggerated. In a new twist, established e-commerce businesses are increasingly opening physical stores. This emerging trend, labelled "clicks to bricks" or "e-tail to retail", looks set to inject some much-needed vigour back into local High Streets. A recent survey in the United States of the shopping habits of 18- to 25-year-olds suggests that just over two thirds of them - some 68% - prefer to shop in stores for clothing and shoes. "Retail observers have been significantly overestimating our use of online and digital technology for shopping - we like shopping in stores," says Nicole Flasch-Mihalko of LIM College, which carried out the survey with the National Retail Federation in the US. Online brands are now acting on this. In the UK, menswear brand Orlebar Brown, whose swimming shorts Daniel Craig famously sported in the James Bond movie Skyfall, has recently opened three London stores. A physical store offers shoppers the chance to touch, feel and try on merchandise, and for luxury brands in particular, this is important. For instance, Rapha, which started as an online business in 2004 selling high-performance cyclewear, opened its first store or Cycle Club in San Francisco in 2011. Now it also has branches in London, Osaka, New York and Sydney. Rapha says its stores have been a big hit with customers, offering a showcase for its clothing but also acting as a place to absorb cycle culture - to drink coffee, join in organised cycle rides and watch major races on big screens. "The Cycle Clubs are conceived as meeting places for road racing fans and great places for like-minded people to hang out," says Rapha's chief executive Simon Mottram. "Rapha is the host of these places and it's great for us to engineer connections between customers, not just between the customer and brand." And he says its stores are also helping Rapha to better understand its customers. "It's hard for brands to engage with their customers in a purely digital way. "That may be fine if your business is only about conducting simple transactions, but if you want to truly connect with a customer and create a deep, ongoing relationship with them, then a physical experience is invaluable. "Many people like to shop in bricks and mortar locations. There is the possibility of theatre and human interaction there - these things shouldn't be underestimated." There is a new model of retailing emerging, "with brands having a core website that covers the majority of purchases", he says. "With a number of high-touch, physical 'brand experiences' on top of that platform - allowing the customer to really engage with the brand." For Bec Clarke, founder and chief executive of jewellers Astley Clarke, it is all about "allowing customers to shop how they want". Her firm has seen rapid online growth, and has now opened a showroom and store at its London headquarters - as well as supplying a number of UK department stores. Within the next few months it also plans to supply several major stores in the United States. "There's a long consideration process to buying jewellery," Clarke explains, as we sit on plush sofas in her firm's showroom, the decor complete with mirrored furniture and luxuriant cream padded walls. "It's a whole journey of trying on and thinking about it and trying on again, and we have to allow the customer to go on that journey," she says. "It's also important for our bespoke service - clients like to see and touch the gemstones. "The heart of our business is online, but we have a 'channel agnostic' approach, which is where the world is moving to." For High Street landlords with vacant space to rent as well as online start-ups this trend is good news, says Ross Bailey, founder and chief executive of Appear Here. His firm brings together shop landlords and mainly e-commerce entrepreneurs, with the aim of making renting a pop-up or permanent physical shop easier and more flexible. "Pop-ups helps fill in any awkward pauses that a landlord may have, and it's good for brand building, too," he says. "It can be hard and expensive to get noticed online now. "But if you spring up offline - even for a short time - shoppers will love the interaction and share their experience of going there by tweeting or sharing an image online. "You can create a storm." Some e-commerce brands are moving into so-called guide shops - allowing shoppers to try on items, and then order in-store for home delivery. Bonobos menswear is at the forefront of this phenomenon, and has opened guide shops across the United States. Increasingly it seems, the channels are blurring. Bonobos founder and chief executive Andy Dunn argues that this is the future of retailing, but that "it is also the past". "When you look at retailers who are thriving in this environment, it's the brands focused on delivering a strong service experience. "It is one of the ironies of our time that a digital medium, the internet, is making the in-person shopping experience a more humane one," he says. </body>

      <title>Ways to plan a hi-tech wedding</title>
      <description>How to plan a hi-tech wedding</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24759238</url>

      <body>Anyone taking a casual stroll around the average wedding fair could be forgiven for thinking that here is a ceremony whose technology has not been updated since the days of Jane Austen. When you consider that the industry is worth more than £10bn a year in the UK alone, you would think the tech giants would be eager to give it a makeover. Instead it is smaller-scale pioneers who are making the in-roads into a sector where tradition still reigns supreme. The BBC asked bride-to-be Ella Williamson to discover how hi-tech a wedding can become. Over the past year, fashion and technology have fused like never before. We've seen the model Dita von Teese step out in the world's first 3D-printed dress and singer Nicole Sherzinger perform in an outfit showing tweets via LED lights threaded into its fabric. So, is it possible to purchase a bridal gown that displays well wishes from loved ones? CuteCircuit, the company behind the Twitter Dress, confirms it would take on such a commission. But its chief creative director suggests a more subtle concoction. "We have made wedding outfits using conductive silver fabric that create a connection when the marrying couple kiss, triggering a private message on the linings of their garments," says Francesca Rosella. The time-honoured ritual of wearing a hat to a wedding has undergone a technological revamp too. Belgian 3D-printing firm i.materialise dabbled with headwear when it launched a millinery competition for designers last year. It now offers two services for creating bespoke headgear - collaborate with one of the company's recommended designers or alternatively design your own and then have it made in the lab. The company's community officer, Tatiana de Wee, adds that 3D-printed "wedding rings, engagement rings and wedding cake toppers" are available too. Merging the virtual world and the real world is an innovative way of getting guests to save the date. So, printing firms have started to offer augmented-reality-enhanced products, allowing invitations to come to life. The process is straightforward - record a one-minute video and send the MP4 file to the company to incorporate it. By holding a smartphone or tablet over the card, the guests can then view a personal message from the bride and groom. Advocates for the tech have claimed it has been about to take off for years - but one of the businesses involved insists the wedding industry is ripe for an AR revolution. "After a slow start 18 months ago, augmented reality printing is now proving popular thanks to increased smartphone ownership, 4G networks and advertising campaigns," Chris Hughes, managing director at Stuprint.com, tells the BBC. No tech wedding is complete without at least one robot. At least Japanese couple Tomohiro Shibata and Satoko Inoue thought so. Their ceremony in 2010 was conducted by i-Fairy, a £46,000 robot by Kokoro. But in 2014, getting married by an automaton should become more affordable thanks to the launch of Oscar the WeddingBot. Oscar is a 2ft (61cm) robot intended to be an officiant, pageboy, usher or speech giver. It uses an Arduino computer as its brain, features a text-to-speech module to talk and a high-definition video camera to see, while the hands were salvaged from a broken Kinderbot toy. "After I completed my first home-made robot in 2012, my friends Mark and Sarah joked about having him at their wedding," says Minneapolis-based inventor Jon Shmig. "I told them I'd make a custom robot and as the list of features expanded I realised that other people may be interested in his services." A prototype was used as a ring bearer at a ceremony in August, and Mr Shmig says he hopes to make the final version available for hire in the US early next year. He adds it will be able to move in time to music - so, be careful that he doesn't cut in to your first dance. With 50,000 downloads in eight weeks alone, Brazil's Boyfriend Tracker app has shown many people want to know their partner's movements. The software secretly sends GPS location and SMS updates about a handset's whereabouts. This begs the question - when will a GPS chip-enabled wedding ring come to market? US engineer Benjamin Kokes has created an engagement ring for his fiancee that features embedded LEDs that illuminate when in close proximity to a specially designed transmitter. But he has doubts about adding a Find My Spouse feature. "I would not rely specifically on GPS - with current technology you couldn't pack enough battery into the ring to have any useful operation," he says. Instead he suggests including a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, which could be detected by strategically placed reader units. For less suspicious but more forgetful nearly-weds, Alaska Jewelry is developing the Remember Ring. The piece of jewellery, which is still at the concept stage, promises to self-heat 24 hours before your anniversary as a reminder. A built-in micro-thermopile would convert the heat from the wearer's hand into electricity to keep its tiny battery charged and its clock running. "We've received quite a bit of interest," says Alaska's Cleve Oines. "But we probably would not launch a GPS ring as GPS trackers and wedding rings are on opposite sides of the sentiment spectrum." If gadget shopping has left you little time to plan the rest of the celebrations, the web can again come to the rescue. American wedding planner TheKnot.com held what's thought to be the first crowdsourced wedding in New York on Valentine's Day this year. Members of the public voted online to select each element of the day - from the outfits to the Modern Ice Castle wedding theme. And if that doesn't sound ideal, you can always Photoshop the pictures. </body>

      <title>German home school families refugees in US</title>
      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24804804</url>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, says that a strand in the home schooling movement developed in the 1970s when some Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <body>The heads of the UK's spying agencies are to face an unprecedented televised grilling by MPs. GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, MI5 director general Andrew Parker and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers will be quizzed by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in public at 14:00 GMT. Intelligence chiefs have given evidence in private for many years. The questioning follows leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden which raised concerns about spying. Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought sanctuary from the US - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. Leaks also suggested its American counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA), had bugged the phone calls of several world leaders. The ISC - chaired by former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind - has already carried out a limited investigation into claims that GCHQ used the NSA's vast Prism programme, which gathers information from internet companies, to circumvent UK laws. Although the committee cleared the agency of any wrongdoing in the 197 specific intelligence reports it looked at, it is now undertaking a wider inquiry into whether the laws governing surveillance are adequate for the internet age. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web, has said encryption cracking by UK and US spy agencies is "appalling and foolish". Intelligence chiefs are expected to be asked about Mr Snowden, as well as subjects including terrorist threats and cybersecurity. Subjects off limits will include details of intelligence techniques and ongoing operations. Mr Parker took over as head of the security service MI5 earlier this year. MI6 is charged with gathering intelligence and GCHQ with monitoring communications. The session is expected to last an hour and a half. It will be shown on the BBC News Channel, with a short time delay to prevent anything being broadcast that might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies. The ISC, made up of senior MPs and peers, said the meeting would "give an insight into the world of intelligence and the work the agencies do on behalf of the UK". The committee said the move was "a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies". </body>

      <title>BAE workers digest job cuts news</title>
      <description>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy.</description>

      <body>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy. They were sent home on Wednesday after the announcement of job cuts, which include about 800 in Scotland. Most of the jobs will go in Portsmouth where shipbuilding will end altogether. There will also be job losses in Filton, near Bristol. Unions at Scotland's shipyards said they hoped many of the job losses would be found through voluntary redundancy. The Scottish yards include Govan and Scotstoun, on the River Clyde in Glasgow, and Rosyth in Fife. The Clyde yards have been earmarked for building the new Type 26 warships. The UK government has been accused by MPs in the south-east of England of sacrificing shipbuilding in Portsmouth because of next year's independence referendum. However, the Scottish government has accused it of "absurd" threat to jobs in Glasgow in the event of a Yes vote. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that in the event of independence, a UK government would be bound to want to build warships inside the UK and not in Scotland. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said Scotland would find it "difficult" to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country voted for independence. But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that in an independent Scotland, joint procurement of Type 26 frigates could be possible. She said: "These ships will be built on the Clyde because BAE said yesterday, and the defence secretary said yesterday, that it's the best place to build them because of the investment we have seen in these yards, because of the skills mix and because of the value for money. "Type 26 frigates, offshore patrol vessels - these are exactly the kind of vessels that an independent Scottish government would need. So we would be procuring some of these Type 26 frigates. "Actually, the sensible proposition in that scenario would be a joint procurement." However, former Conservative Defence Minister Sir Gerald Howarth told the programme the issue was about European law. He said: "Under article 346, national security determines that if we wish to maintain exclusivity in the United Kingdom in order to maintain our sovereign capability, then we can do so. "If Scotland were no longer part of the United Kingdom, then Scotland would not enjoy that same privilege which they enjoy today. "Nor would the United Kingdom enjoy that same exemption." The defence contractor and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have announced measures which they hope will offset the effect of the job cuts. Among the plans are more than £100m of investment to expand the dockyard at Portsmouth. Three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal Navy will also be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. This could help sustain shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 Global Combat ships. BAE said it had agreed with the MoD "that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships". "The company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy," it said. It said the cost of this restructuring would be borne by the MoD. BAE said it would now begin consultation to cut 1,775 jobs "to result from these restructuring proposals". The MoD confirmed that it would commission three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels to play "a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti smuggling operations". It said these would be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards. Work on the new vessels is due to begin next year with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017. The ships are expected to replace the current, smaller River Class vessels which have been policing the UK's waters since 2003. Mr Hammond said more than £100m would be invested in Portsmouth. The money will be used to expand the dockyard to ensure it is ready for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales as well as the Type 45 destroyers which are based in Portsmouth. Workers at BAE's Scotstoun and Govan yards were told by management there would be about 800 jobs lost in Scotland but no breakdown was given. Workers who left the yards said they were worried and disappointed, but that the announcement was not unexpected. Alex Taylor, 63, a plater at Govan, said: "We've known for a while that the workload isn't there to carry the amount of people that we had building the carriers, but hopefully voluntary redundancies will take up the slack." He added that those affected by the job cuts at Portsmouth were "working class guys the same as ourselves, they're just shipbuilders. "We're obviously relieved that things are looking better for the Clyde, but that doesn't mean to say that we've not got feelings for our comrades in Portsmouth." </body>

      <body>A man has been charged with manslaughter following the death of two teenage girls who were hit by a car. Jasmine Allsop, 14, and Olivia Lewry, 16, were struck by a Honda Civic in the early hours of Sunday while walking in Gosport, Hampshire. Jasmine was pronounced dead at the scene while Olivia died later at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. Samuel Etherington, aged 20, of Gosport, is charged with two counts of gross negligence manslaughter. He will appear at Portsmouth Magistrates' Court later. Ian Harris, the head of the Crown Prosecution Service's complex casework unit, said: "I have reached my decision after carefully considering all the available evidence provided to me by Hampshire Constabulary. "I am satisfied... that there is sufficient evidence and that it is in the public interest to prosecute Samuel Etherington for these offences. "Jasmine and Olivia have died in tragic circumstances and I would like to extend my very deepest sympathies to their families and friends." </body>

      <title>Terror suspect cut off security tag</title>
      <description>Details emerge of how a Somali-born terror suspect escaped from surveillance after changing into a burka at a mosque.</description>

      <body>Details have emerged of how a terror suspect escaped from surveillance after changing into a burka at a mosque. Somali-born Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, used a sharp instrument to cut off his electronic tag on Friday. The tag, imposed under the terms of a terrorism prevention measures order (TPim), issued a "tamper-alert" to its makers, the private security firm G4S. They rang the suspect and contacted the Home Office after he failed to answer. Police were alerted but he had fled. The BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner said Mr Mohamed was likely to be under MI5 surveillance. Mr Mohamed arrived at the An-Noor Masjid and Community Centre, in west London, at approximately 10:00 GMT on Friday, and was seen inside at 15:15. During that time he cut off his tag and changed this appearance, with CCTV images showing him leaving the mosque disguised as a woman. His restrictive surveillance regime, which includes a 21:30 GMT curfew, was due to expire by January. Mr Mohamed is now the subject of a police-led manhunt and could face up to five years in prison if caught. The Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command, MI5 and the UK's Border Force have joined forces to find him. Mr Mohamed is the second terror suspect under a TPim order to go missing. He is believed to have close links to al-Shabab, the Somali insurgent group that raided Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in September, resulting in 67 deaths, but officials said there was not enough evidence to bring a criminal case against him in court. TPims restrict the movements of people thought to pose a risk to the public, but who cannot be tried for reasons of national security and who cannot be deported. TPims were brought in last year to replace control orders which were introduced by the last Labour government. Those subject to TPims face restrictions, such as where they stay, who they contact and where they travel, but these differ from control orders in that suspects cannot be forced to relocate to another part of the UK. As of September, nine men - eight of them British - were under TPim surveillance. </body>

      <title>Many councils 'plan to increase tax'</title>
      <description>Many English councils look set to increase council tax next year, despite government cash on offer if they freeze it, a survey suggests.</description>

      <body>Almost a third of all English councils plan to increase council tax next year despite a government cash incentive to freeze it, a survey suggests. According to the research published by the Local Government Chronicle, Conservative-run county councils are most likely to be considering a rise. Ministers said councillors faced a choice between helping with the cost of living or increasing local taxes. But 75% of the county councils which responded said they planned a rise. Out of 354 councils, 154 responded to the survey. 53% said they would accept the extra government funding on offer - equivalent to a 1% council tax rise. On the other hand 32% said they would not accept the funding and were considering a rise - likely to be up to 1.9% since a rise of above 2% requires a referendum. 15% said they did not know. Of 27 county councils, 12 responded to the Local Government Chronicle survey, and nine of these said they would reject the extra government funding. Two said they would accept the government's funding and agree to freeze taxes for two years, and one did not know. David Hodge, chairman of the County Councils Network and leader of Surrey County Council, said counties faced a "particularly challenging set of circumstances". He said that demand for services - such as adult social care - was rising, roads had "taken a hell of a hammering" and were costly to repair and there was a "major shortage" in school places. "Central government has a choice - they can either support councils in meeting growing demand pressures via direct support or by giving councils the flexibility to raise taxes locally," he added. "We are already finding it difficult to ensure our books balance." But Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis said he would "encourage every council" to take up the offer of funding, which would be paid in financial years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. "Over the last three years, the government has worked with councils to cut council tax by 10% in real terms," he said. "Extra funding is on the table for councils to freeze council tax for another two years. "There is a clear choice for councillors: extra help for hard-working people with the cost of living, or higher state taxation to fund more council administration." </body>

      <body>The police search for a missing British woman whose body was eventually found in the stairwell of a San Francisco hospital was flawed, the local sheriff has admitted. Lynne Spalding, 57, from Peterlee, County Durham, was being treated at the city's General Hospital when she disappeared on 21 September. Her body was found 17 days later in one of the hospital's exterior stairwells. Sheriff Ross Mirkarimi said he wanted to make sure it never happened again. Ms Spalding, who moved to San Francisco several years ago, was being treated for a bladder infection at the hospital. Following her disappearance, the hospital was searched and police opened a missing person investigation. Sheriff Mirkarimi told reporters at City Hall that deputies searching for Ms Spalding had failed to look in all the stairwells. They also had the wrong racial description for the mother of two and waited days to share surveillance footage. "She could have been anyone's loved one, which is why the gravity of the situation is not lost on any of us,'' Sheriff Mirkarimi said. `"What happened to Miss Spalding Ford should not have happened to anyone.'' Ms Spalding's family has previously criticised the slow progress of the police and hospital investigation into how she was able to remain missing for so long. Ms Spalding, who was mother to a 23-year-old daughter and a son, aged 19, had worked in the travel industry. The local medical examiner has yet to say how she died. </body>

      <body>British families throw away an average of the equivalent of six meals per week in food waste, research has suggested. Publicly-funded recycling group the Waste and Resources Action Programme (Wrap) said this would amount to £60 a month for a household. Wrap said buying too much, serving large portions and confusion over food labelling were the main causes. Its chief executive Dr Liz Goodwin called on stores, food manufacturers and government to tackle the situation. The foods most commonly thrown out were staples such as bread, milk and potatoes. Some 86 million chickens were said to be discarded every year. Wrap advised people to buy just what they need, serve smaller portions, and understand the difference between "best before" and "use by" dates. The organisation, funded by the governments of the UK and the EU, said households had cut food waste by 21% over five years, saving consumers £13bn. But Dr Goodwin said this could be reduced by a further 1.7 million tonnes a year by 2025. She said: "Consumers are seriously worried about the cost of food and how it has increased over recent years. Yet, as Wrap's research shows, we are still wasting millions of tonnes and billions of pounds. "The UK is leading the way in tackling food waste and the 21% cut is a terrific achievement by millions of people who have taken action, saved money and helped safeguard our natural resources. "However, there is so much more to go for and I believe we should be going for it." The government's resource management minister, Dan Rogerson, said "there is still more to do". "Everyone has a role to play in reducing food waste and we want to see businesses helping consumers to waste less food," he said. "Cutting waste and driving business innovation will help to build a stronger economy. We will continue to work closely with food retailers and manufacturers to achieve this goal."

      <title>Universal Credit problems 'alarming'</title>
      <description>The implementation of the flagship welfare reform has been "extraordinarily poor", MPs say, but ministers insist improvements are being made.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24839358</url>

      <body>The implementation of the government's flagship welfare reform has been "extraordinarily poor", with much of the £425m expenditure to date likely to be written off, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said oversight of the Universal Credit scheme had been "alarmingly weak". Warning signs were missed and there was a "fortress culture" among officials, it claimed. Ministers said there was new leadership and controls had been strengthened. The criticisms by the cross-party committee echo those by the National Audit Office - which said in September that management of the £2.3bn project had been weak and financial controls had been inefficient. Ministers have insisted the plan to consolidate six separate means-tested working age benefits into a single payment - designed to increase incentives for work - is back on track following a "reset" of the programme at the start of the year. But the committee said the project had been beset by a string of problems and still faced considerable challenges if it was to achieve its long-term objectives. It suggested much of the £425m spent up to April, about a third of which has been on computer software and other IT systems, was unlikely to have any worth in future and its value would have to be written off. Controls over suppliers, it added, had been largely absent with, in some cases, multi-million pound orders being signed off by secretarial staff. From the outset of the project in 2011, it said, senior civil servants had "failed to grasp the enormity" of the task they had been set by ministers, did not monitor progress adequately and had not intervened when issues arose. A lack of day-to-day control meant that top officials only became aware of difficulties through "ad hoc reviews" and as problems mounted, those in charge of the scheme had become "isolated and defensive". "Universal Credit is the Department for Work and Pensions' single biggest programme and enjoys cross-party support yet its implementation has been extraordinarily poor," Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the body, said. "The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money. "Pressure to deliver a programme of this magnitude within such an ambitious timescale created a fortress culture where only good news was reported and problems were denied." Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has insisted that Universal Credit can still be rolled out to all existing and new claimants as planned by 2017 - a view endorsed by officials from the Major Projects Authority who were drafted in earlier this year to run the rule over the scheme. But the committee said the pilots conducted to date had been unsatisfactory and a target to enrol 184,000 new claimants on to the single benefit by next April would be missed. "The department will have to speed up the later stages of the programme if it is to meet the 2017 completion date but that will pose new risks," Mrs Hodge added, urging the government not to throw "good money after bad". "We believe strongly that meeting any specific timetable from now on is less important than delivering the programme successfully." Appearing before the committee in September, the top civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions rejected suggestions the Universal Credit was launched "without a plan". Robert Devereux said the strategy behind the policy was "very clear" and the "best available" people were running it. But he accepted there had been a "let's punch through" mentality among the original management team and its leadership was changed once it became clear that a different, more reflective approach was needed. Howard Shiplee, who took over the running of the project in May, has admitted mistakes were made but said real progress was now happening and much of the existing IT systems could be used. Responding to the committee's report, the Department for Work and Pensions said Universal Credit was a "vital" reform which would ultimately bring £38bn in benefits to society by helping people into work and reducing fraud. "This report doesn't take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery," it said. "We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls." It said it did not accept "the write-off figure quoted by the committee" and expected it to be substantially less. A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith said he had "every confidence" in the team now running the programme, including Mr Devereux - whose position some newspapers have suggested is under threat. "Both the National Audit Office and the public accounts committee acknowledged a fortress mentality within the Universal Credit programme," he said. "Iain was clear back in the summer about how he and the permanent secretary took action to fix those problems." For Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the report was "another nail in the coffin of the government's promise to deliver Universal Credit on time and on budget", adding that "families facing a cost of living crisis need welfare reform they can trust". </body>

      <body>London Gateway, the UK's newest container port, is due to welcome its first vessel. The £1.5bn facility at Thurrock, Essex, is 20 miles (32km) down the River Thames from London. It is owned by Dubai-based DP World, which says it will be able to handle 3.5 million containers a year. It is forecast that the development will create 27,000 jobs in London and the South East and contribute £2.4bn a year to its economy. On a visit to the site in June, Prime Minister David Cameron described the port as an "emblem of ambition". But trade union Unite has previously held protests at the port as part of a row over union recognition. The union claims that rather than creating jobs, London Gateway could suck business and jobs away from other UK ports, as well as undermine the pay and conditions of workers. DP World has said that if a majority of workers wished to be recognised, it would enter talks with the relevant union. The first vessel scheduled to dock at the port is the MOL Caledon, a 58,000-tonne container ship, laden with fruit and wine from South Africa. </body>

      <body>Three boys have been cautioned for killing more than 50 doves in Surrey. The birds were shot with an airgun in a dovecote in Bookham, near Leatherhead. The boys were aged between 10 and 11. Wildlife Aid Foundation said it had treated five adult and four baby doves for their injuries, but the baby doves died. The birds were killed on 21 August but police said giving youngsters youth conditional cautions was a lengthy process. The cautions are aimed at teaching the offenders the impact of their actions. The boys will also work at an animal shelter or charity, be educated on the dangers of firearms and attend sessions on the consequences of crime, Surrey Police said. The force has reissued guidance on the ownership of air guns. Under-14s must by supervised by someone aged over 21 on private land and have the owner's permission. John Pearson, Mole Valley neighbourhood sergeant, said: "Air weapon owners have very strict legal requirements and social responsibilities which they must meet. "This was a shocking scene for the owners to return to and frightening [that] those children could be responsible, which emphasises the need for such weapons to be stored securely." </body>

      <title>Climate wavering 'not justified'</title>
      <description>Government advisers say the UK is not out of step with major nations in reducing emissions.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24834697</url>

      <body>Britain is playing its part in a worldwide bid to reduce emissions and should not weaken its proposed cuts, says a report to the UK government. The Committee on Climate Change says no change in global science or policy justifies a slackening of effort. The report was compiled after Chancellor George Osborne said the UK's competitiveness might be put at risk by leading the world in curbing emissions. The CCC research challenges this assumption. "It is not accurate to say that the UK is leading the world on this," the CCC’s chief executive David Kennedy told BBC News. "We aren’t acting alone. We have made ambitious commitments, but other countries have too – they are acting on them and developing low-carbon technologies. "Some of our European counterparts are discussing targets stricter than ours for 2030 so if we want to be part of the low-carbon revolution we will have to make sure we aren’t left behind." Mr Kennedy said China was now clearly global leader in clean technology: "China is leading the low-carbon revolution. It has committed to invest in 700 Gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2020 – that’s 10 times the whole UK power system. "They are investing in five million electric vehicles – in multiples of what we are doing here. “Even the US is cutting its emissions and is committed to doing so in coming years.” The shale gas revolution in the US has forced down emissions because gas is much less polluting than coal; the report says it is likely that the US will meet its commitment to reduce 2020 emissions by 17% on 2005 levels. It points out that China has committed to reduce carbon-intensity by 40-45% from 2005 to 2020, and introduced policies to deliver in its 12th five-year plan. With ongoing action, China’s emissions could peak in the early 2020s, the report says. It says Germany has also made medium-term commitments in line with the UK. But Mr Kennedy admitted that the world’s efforts were still nowhere near enough to keep the world on track for a high likelihood of a stable climate. The World Meteorological Organization has announced that greenhouse gases has reached another record. UNEP’s Emissions Gap report also warned that delaying emissions cuts would make the task even more expensive. The CCC was founded to advise government on how to meet the Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to reducing CO2 80% by 2050, in a step-by-step process. For several years the Chancellor has expressed fears about the impact of climate policies on the affordability of energy in the UK. At the Conservative Party conference he told The Times that Britain should not be "in front of the world" on tackling climate change. But the Climate Change Act was designed specifically to make it hard for future politicians to weaken long-term priorities when faced with political difficulty. In order to reduce the UK’s targets, there needs to have been a weakening of the science base or of international action. But the CCC’s report says: “We conclude in this report that, in respect of science, international and EU criteria, there has been no significant change in the circumstances upon which the budget was set. In this regard, there is therefore no legal or economic basis to support a change in the fourth carbon budget. A Treasury spokesman said: "We want to tackle climate change, but it should be done in a way that doesn't put huge costs on people's energy bills or destroys manufacturing jobs. The shale gas revolution in America shows you can reduce carbon emissions, bring bills down and create jobs." The committee thinks the UK is most unlikely to experience a US-style shale gas boom. The committee is concerned at the political backlash against green energy, which it believes has been fuelled by newspaper campaigns. It says renewable energy subsidies are likely to bring down energy bills in the medium term if gas prices continue to rise as many analysts forecast. Doug Parr from Greenpeace said: "The CCC reminds us that tackling climate change is as urgent as ever, but the Treasury persists with its scientifically illiterate campaign to unravel domestic climate policy. The Lib Dems must not allow a watered down fourth carbon budget." Rhian Kelly, the CBI's director for business environment, said: "It seems sensible to maintain the fourth carbon budget at this point in time. However, as the CCC suggests, it would be prudent for the Government to look again at the UK's emissions reduction pathway once EU discussions have concluded, to make sure we remain aligned." Jonathan Grant from consultant PwC said: "The Committee is right to highlight the danger of changing tack or rolling back regulations, as it could undermine business and investor confidence that long term government policy will deliver what is needed to tackle climate change. "In the short term, UK energy emissions increased 2.6% last year, much higher than GDP growth, because of an increased use of coal in power generation. The cost of wholesale transformation of energy generation and other green measures highlights the challenge that politicians are facing everywhere on climate change." Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <body>Many parents fear music videos have become too sexualised and violent, the founder of a parenting website has said. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, said parents were not prudes, but felt things had "gone too far". In a survey of some 1,500 website members, most (82%) said their children had repeated sexual lyrics without knowing their meaning. And three-quarters said they tried to stop children watching music videos. Ms Freegard said parents were most angry that their children were being exposed to "lewd viewing" on programmes shown before the 21:00 watershed for family viewing. "Modern parents aren't prudes - they know sex sells," she said. "But there's a strong feeling that things have gone too far now. It's toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to." Most (75%) of parents with daughters said very sexual pop acts were teaching girls they would be "judged on their looks, not their achievements or personality". About half of parents with sons said they were frightened explicit footage made them believe women were "too sexually available" and that they should have "unrealistic porn-star-style body shapes". About 1,500 members of the website opted to take part in the online survey last month, shortly after an outcry over the latest music video and performances by Miley Cyrus. The Irish singer Sinead O'Connor recently warned the former children's TV star not to let herself be exploited by the music business, sparking a row between the pair. Two-thirds of parents taking part said they thought young female singers were being exploited. Defending a recent controversial performance, Miley Cyrus said people were "over-thinking" what she had done and that she had been trying to "make history". </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

Police said they received a telephone call on Wednesday night claiming men were trying to get into a house in south Belfast and that they had a gun. A short time later, police chased a car along the Donegall Road, cutting across it and forcing it up onto the pavement. An officer drew his gun and a shot was fired. It is believed the gun was fired accidentally. The four men in the car were arrested. None of the four was injured. The Donegall Road between the City Hospital and Roden Street was cordoned off as police carried out the arrests. The matter has been referred to the police ombudsman. </body>

      <body>Chief Constable Matt Baggott has urged politicians to do more to tackle the misery caused by alcohol. He was speaking in Omagh where he praised the community's response in helping to keep the town safe at night after the deaths of two young people. Matt Baggott said one in five crimes in Northern Ireland were alcohol related, and 61% of street violence involved alcohol. He described the statistics as "frightening, phenomenal and horrific". Jason McGovern, 19, from County Monaghan and Darren McBrearty, 28, from Omagh both died after being assaulted during nights out in Omagh in the past year. Mr Baggott said he believed politics had got in the way of addressing some of the strategic issues around alcohol. "There are some big problems in Northern Ireland, but I have to say to you things like flag protests and all that get put in perspective when we see what we see in terms of broken lives and sometimes how the lack of consensus takes policing away from the things that really matter, which is actually being on the streets helping young people to be safe," he said. Referring to his 37 years as a police officer, he said he had lost count of the misery that he had had to deal with because of alcohol "from the lost lives, the blighted futures, the families that are broken because of it, and what does it cost? 32p for a tin of beer?" He called for the police to be given pre-emptive powers to close problem premises before violence breaks out, and for a debate around a minimum price for alcohol. He also praised Omagh Policing and Community Safety Partnership's Safer Streets initiative. It has trained volunteer "street angels" to help people get home safely, by handing out hot drinks and providing first aid and shelter. "Having seen what's been going on here in the last few months and how people have taken tragedy and turned it into something of hope and the street safe scheme, it's massively impressive," he said. "What you are doing here isn't just fantastic in terms of the town centre, but it's pushing those in authority to do more about alcohol and to leave aside the things that don't matter and put in place the things that really do matter for a change." </body>

      <title>Wind turbine's £5 power a month</title>
      <description>A wind turbine that cost the Welsh government £48,000 to buy and install at one of its offices generates an average of just over £5 worth of electricity a month.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-24844182</url>

      <body>A wind turbine that cost the Welsh government £48,000 to buy has been generating an average of just £5 worth of electricity per month. The turbine was put its Aberystwyth office, rated excellent for sustainability, in 2009. The Welsh government said the turbine had had mechanical problems. But before it was installed, the turbine makers warned Welsh government contractors it would not be exposed to enough wind where it was to be placed. The turbine's output has been monitored officially since January last year and figures suggest it could take hundreds of years for it to offset the cost of its purchase and installation. The Welsh government confirmed in a response to a Freedom Of Information request that between January 2012 and July this year the turbine generated 585 kilowatt hours of energy (kWh) - an average of 33 kWh per month. Taking 16p as an estimate for the current price of electricity per kWh in the consumer market, it works out at a value of £5.28 per month. The Welsh government said there had been mechanical problems with the turbine and that throughout 2012 it was only operating at 26% of its capacity. Some improvements have been made and as of January this year it has been operating at 68%. But if it continues to operate at 68% capacity then it will generate 55.25 kWh per month - electricity with a value of £8.84. At that rate it would take around 452 years to offset the cost of buying and installing the turbine. The company which manufactured the turbine, Quiet Revolution, said mechanical problems were not the main reason for its performance - it was the location. The company showed BBC Wales a letter written before the turbine was installed which made it clear that it was very sceptical that the location would expose the turbine to enough wind to make it viable. That letter was sent to a company called Mitie which was acting as the contractor to the Welsh government on the project. Neither Mitie nor the Welsh government have been able to confirm yet whether Quiet Revolution's advice was taken into account when the turbine was given the go-ahead. It is not uncommon for an organisation to use a small wind turbine like this as a way of generating some of its own electricity. Paul Burrell from Anemos, a company based in Machynlleth, Powys, which installs small and medium-sized wind turbines, said that in the right location turbines like this could be very effective. "I think the problem is quite simple - it's been put in the wrong place," he said. "It's very important with any wind turbine to ensure it's in the most exposed location possible. They need unobstructed access to wind from all directions. "Unfortunately the Welsh government's one is located in a valley, two miles from the sea and has quite a short tower. "It's located next to tall buildings so even if there's a strong wind it will be displaced by the time it reaches the turbine, it will be very patchy and lacking in potential so the turbine won't get the chance to spin properly." He said using a wind turbine was a sound economic investment as long as it was in the right location. "The payback period (on initial capital investment) can be anywhere between four and seven years," he added. "There are many examples of turbines across Wales on track to do this. "A turbine this size should produce around 9,000 kWh per year which is a significant amount of power." A Welsh government spokesperson said: "We have an ambitious carbon management strategy for the whole of our estate which includes a wide range of activities aimed at reducing CO2 emissions. "For example, the Welsh government office in Aberystwyth includes a biomass heating system, solar panels and a wind turbine designed to power a small number of workstations. "As a result we have seen a 17% reduction in CO2 emissions over the past two years and are well on course to meet the overarching target of a 30% reduction by 2020." </body>

      <title>Two thirds obese or overweight</title>
      <description>Nearly two thirds of people in Wales in their early 40s are overweight or obese, according to new research.</description>

      <body>Nearly two thirds of people in Wales in their early 40s are overweight or obese, according to new research. The University of London study found 37% of adults were overweight by the age of 42 and men are more likely than women to have a weight problem but are less likely to realise it. A further one in four men (26%) and women (27%) were obese. Researchers studied the body mass index (BMI) of almost 10,000 men and women in Wales, Scotland and England. Men in Wales were significantly more likely to be overweight than women in middle age, the research finds. Nearly half of men (46%) were overweight at 42, compared to almost a third of women (30%). In Scotland, the proportion of men and women who were overweight at age 42 was identical to Wales, while obesity rates were slightly lower. The proportion of middle-aged adults in England who were overweight was also similar but the obesity level was again lower - 23% for men and 19% for women. The study said that British men were significantly less likely than women to realise they are carrying excess weight. The research was carried out by Dr Alice Sullivan and Matt Brown of the university's institute of education centre for longitudinal studies. Dr Sullivan said: "People who are overweight or obese face a higher risk of many health problems, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and certain cancers," she said. "But carrying excess weight is far more socially acceptable for men than for women and men will not respond to health messages about weight and obesity if they do not recognise that they are overweight. "This is a particular concern given that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death for men aged 35 and over." The researchers also found that men and women born in 1970 were considerably more likely to be obese at 42 than those born in 1958 at the same age. "People born in 1970 grew up at a time when lifestyles were becoming increasingly inactive and high-calorie convenience foods were widely available for the first time," said Dr Sullivan. "We know that both exercise and diet are important for maintaining a healthy weight. "But our findings show that ready meals, frozen foods, and takeaways are popular with this generation, while nearly a third (32%) of women and a quarter (24%) of men do no vigorous exercise in a typical week." Perhaps unsurprisingly, said researchers, only four in 10 men (41%) who were overweight said they were making an effort to shed excess pounds, compared to two thirds (66%) of women. Obese women were also more likely to be trying to lose weight (77%) compared to 62% of obese men. Connah's Quay GP Dr Mark Harney said the study was a true reflection of what he was seeing at his surgery. "It is quite a shocking statistic that two in three Welsh adults are overweight," he told BBC Radio Wales. "The emphasis in this study is on men. Half of men at 42 are overweight compared with a third of women and in general practice we do find that men are a tough nut to crack. "My lady patients, many of them who are overweight have been on diets since they were 16." He said women were more aware of weight loss because it was covered in the media but "being big and heavy and strong is a bit of a man thing," he added. "It's hard sometimes to get through to middle aged men," said Dr Harney. Dr Sullivan will present the findings at a seminar in London on Thursday, as part of the Economic and Social Research Council's Festival of Social Science. She will underline the importance of making men more aware of their BMI status and the health risks associated with excess weight. </body>

      <body>A series of proposals to revive Scotland's town centres is being launched by the government. Plans include £2m to help bring empty town centre properties back into use, and more rates relief for businesses that take on these properties. Fresh ideas will be encouraged through community involvement and a competition for entrepreneurs. Local Government Minister Derek Mackay will say town centres should be vibrant places to live, work and socialise. The Town Centre Action Plan is a cross-government response to the independent National Review of Town Centres, which was chaired by architect Malcolm Fraser, and published in July. Mr Mackay will say town centres should be places that encourage business start-up and inspire innovative idea. "We recognise the importance of securing the future of our high streets as the economic centre of our towns," he is expected to say. "The plan marks a new era for Scotland's town centres and we will continue to work in partnership with local authorities, private and community organisations to ensure they are vibrant places to live, work and socialise." Mr Mackay will be launching the plan during a visit to Bank Street in Kilmarnock, which following work by East Ayrshire Council, local traders groups and businesses, reached 100% occupancy in October. Councillor Douglas Reid, leader of East Ayrshire Council said: "The Bank Street area of Kilmarnock is the perfect example of what can be achieved. "Over many years, this area has benefitted from investment in regeneration projects and owners of buildings have been given help to restore and upgrade their premises. "The council has also worked to enhance the look of the street with improved street furniture and lighting, new cobbles and street artwork." The Action Plan includes: </body>

      <description>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual.</description>

      <body>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual, according to a study. Scientists examined almost 650 dementia patients and assessed when each one had been diagnosed with the condition. They found people who spoke two or more languages experienced a later onset of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. The bilingual advantage extended to illiterate people. The scientists said it confirmed the observed effect was not caused by differences in formal education. The study was by Edinburgh University and Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad in India. It is the largest study so far to gauge the impact of bilingualism on the onset of dementia, independent of a person's education, gender, occupation and whether they live in a city or in the country, all of which have been examined as potential factors influencing the onset of dementia. The team of researchers said further studies were needed to determine the mechanism, which causes the delay in the onset of dementia. The researchers suggested bilingual switching between different sounds, words, concepts, grammatical structures and social norms constituted a form of natural brain training, which was likely to be more effective than any artificial brain training programme. However, studies of bilingualism are complicated in that bilingual populations are often ethnically and culturally different from monolingual societies. In places like Hyderabad, bilingualism is part of everyday life, knowledge of several languages is the norm and monolingualism is an exception. Thomas Bak, of Edinburgh University's school of philosophy, psychology and language sciences said: "These findings suggest that bilingualism might have a stronger influence on dementia than any currently available drugs. "This makes the study of the relationship between bilingualism and cognition one of our highest priorities." The study is published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. </body>

      <body>A mother stabbed her pet dog in a bid to save her four-year-old daughter from a fatal attack, said police. Jodi Hudson stabbed the dog, Mulan, with a kitchen knife as it mauled her daughter Lexi Branson at their flat in Mountsorrel, near Loughborough, on Tuesday. Lexi died in hospital. The family got the dog from a rehoming centre two months ago. Leicestershire Police said the dog was a bulldog, which was "not a breed listed under the Dangerous Dogs Act". Det Supt David Sandall said Lexi had been off sick from school on Tuesday and was at home when Mulan, thought to be aged between six and eight, attacked her. "We're still continuing the investigation and we're going to look completely at the history of where the dog's come from, how it's come into the family environment and we're doing the investigation on behalf of the coroner who, obviously, we have to show the events leading up to the death of Lexi," said Det Supt Sandall. "But it's just a very, very tragic case that we're dealing with here today." Asked by the BBC to confirm the breed, a Leicestershire Police spokeswoman reiterated that the dog was being "classified as a bulldog". Lexi's mother and grandmother Kerry Hudson said she would be sadly missed and never forgotten. In a statement, they said: "Lexi was a bubbly, bright little girl. "She fought for her life from the moment she was born as she was born three months prematurely. She's been taken from us so tragically. "She will be sadly missed, she will be our shining star in the sky and she we will never be forgotten." David Williams, head teacher of Christ Church and St Peter's C of E primary school in Mountsorrel, where Lexi had just started as a pupil, said: "The whole school has been devastated by Lexi's death." He said bereavement counsellors had been called in to speak to pupils. </body>

      <body>The father of a baby found dead with a fractured skull had been previously jailed for child cruelty and was a "massive risk", an inquest has heard. Three-month-old Nico Maynard died at home in Southampton in September 2011. He was also found to have a broken leg. Hamid Baldelli had served a year in jail for an offence against another child in another part of the country. In a report on his release Baldelli was described as "as being a massive risk to young children". The inquest heard a social worker had also raised concerns over his control, power and anger issues. However social services in Southampton said they knew nothing of Baldelli's past. His previous victim had also suffered a skull fracture and limb fractures. Southampton Coroner Keith Wiseman recorded an open verdict and said there was considerable uncertainty about how Nico came to die. A serious case review published last week into the baby's death called for a national register to be set up for those who commit child cruelty crimes, so they can be tracked. Baldelli moved to Hampshire after leaving prison in 2009, and started a relationship with Jodie Maynard in Southampton with whom he had twins. Baldelli said he found Nico cold and stiff and face down in his Moses basket in the early hours of 22 September 2011 and an ambulance was called. He was confirmed dead at hospital later and post-mortem tests showed fractures to the skull and thigh bone. Further tests discovered a brain injury, probably linked to the skull fracture, that had happened several days previously. The surviving twin sister also had fractures to the tibia and skull. The hearing was told Baldelli and Miss Maynard were arrested on suspicion of murder. They said Nico had fallen off a sofa two weeks previously. Det Insp Linda Howard, from Hampshire Police, said this was not a plausible explanation of the injuries. She said: "We obviously looked at the history of the parents and the previous incident as well." The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it did not charge the pair because it was not possible to know who caused the injuries, which happened over a wide timescale when the mother and father and other family members had care of Nico, Ms Howard said. In addition, several experts did not agree on a cause of death, even though the skull fracture was significant, she said. However, a detailed hearing into the case was held, the inquest was told. The judge found that on the balance of probability - a much lesser burden of proof than that required in a criminal case - Baldelli was responsible for inflicting the injuries on the children. He said Baldelli "had a temper and a disposition to outbursts of anger which he could at times not control and this had led him on several occasions to inflict injuries upon his children". The judge also said Miss Maynard was "culpable of an appalling failure to protect her children". "She either knows or ought to know what happened but has resolutely refused to countenance the possibility that the father injured the children," the judge added. He concluded the most likely way the fracture happened was by a blunt trauma to the head, but he agreed with the experts that the injury did not solely cause the death. </body>

      <body>Aaron Ramsey's header gave Arsenal a battling victory over Borussia Dortmund to keep Arsene Wenger's side top of Champions League Group F. Wojciech Szczesny denied Marco Reus and Jakub Blaszczykowski as Arsenal looked to contain Dortmund in the first hour. The Gunners scored with their first effort at goal when Ramsey forced home Mesut Ozil's cross after 62 minutes. Ramsey almost made it 2-0 moments later and an increasingly desperate Dortmund side could not deny them a famous win. Arsenal became the first English team to win at Dortmund's imposing Westfalenstadion home with their 14th win in 15 unbeaten away games. That run started in March with a victory at Bayern Munich - the eventual European champions - and this result against the team Bayern beat in last season's final was just as impressive. Ramsey's goal secured the points, but the win came on the back of a measured performance that saw Arsenal keep Dortmund at arm's length for long periods and score with a classic counter-attack. The Gunners concentrated on keeping possession in the first half but their conservative approach meant they had just one corner to show for it. At the other end, Dortmund were producing some typically inventive approach play but struggled to find a way through the visitors' defence, and were unable to find a finish when they did. Neven Subotic hooked a volley wide after Ramsey inadvertently headed a Reus free-kick back into the danger zone, and Blaszczykowski was also off target when he met Kevin Grosskreutz's cross. The home side's best chance before the break fell to Henrikh Mkhitaryan, who was teed up by Blaszczykowski but fired wide after trying to pick his spot from the edge of the area. Trying to keep a team with as much attacking flair as Dortmund quiet appeared a risky tactic, especially when the home side upped the tempo early in the second half. A Reus header zipped up off the slick surface and forced Szczesny into his first save of the night, quickly followed by his second from a Blaszczykowski snap-shot following a quick break. Reus buried the follow-up but the flag was already up for offside. Just as the Dortmund pressure was building, however, Arsenal struck with their first meaningful attack. Olivier Giroud caused havoc in the area from Ozil's cross and Ramsey darted in to beat Neven Subotic to the dropping ball, stooping to head past Roman Weidenfeller. What had been a cagey game suddenly became wide open and moments later another Arsenal counter-attack almost saw them extend their lead. Ramsey was again on the end of it but this time his shot was pushed away by Weidenfeller. Dortmund threatened an immediate response when Reus failed to convert Lewandowski's cross but there was more happening at the other end, with Nuri Sahin clearing off the line and Per Mertesacker almost getting on the end of an inviting delivery. In the end one goal was enough. Dortmund had failed to score only once in their last 60 home games and had won their last eight home ties in the Champions League, but their search for an equaliser constantly ran into dead ends and Szczesny did not have another serious save to make before the end. The win gave Arsenal much-needed revenge for their defeat at home to Dortmund a fortnight ago, but their passage through to the last 16 is still far from straightforward. Even if the Gunners beat bottom side Marseille at the Emirates on 26 November, they could still need to pick up a point at Napoli in their final group game in order to secure their progress. </body>

      <description>Celtic's hopes of progression to the Champions League last 16 are dealt a blow after losing to Ajax in Amsterdam.</description>

      <body>Celtic turned in their poorest Champions League performance of the campaign as they fell to a potentially damaging defeat in Amsterdam. Lasse Schone's wonderfully-worked goal was enough to avenge the defeat the Dutch suffered at the hands of Neil Lennon's side in Glasgow. It leaves Celtic bottom of Group H with just three points from four games. Even if they beat Milan at home in their next game, they may need to take something from Barcelona to progress. Celtic's display was all the more disappointing given the positivity with which they arrived in the Dutch capital. But the thousands of travelling supporters were given little to cheer as their team barely threatened the Ajax goal. The home side were on top throughout and the winning Ajax goal was befitting of any of the teams who have worn the famous red and white jerseys over the years. A fabulous move of one-touch passing involving Schone, Davy Klaassen, Siem de Jong and Thulani Serero left the Celtic defence gaping in wonder as the Dane rounded it off by poking it cutely past goalkeeper Fraser Forster. Schone - impressive throughout - almost curled in a second direct from a corner, only for Emilio Izaguirre to head off the line. Ajax also struck the post late on, with Forster gratefully watching Stefano Denswil's header come off the upright. The tone was set by Celtic's first-half performance, which failed to reach the standards set previously in the Champions League, typified by defensive lapses and an inability to impose themselves in an attacking sense. Despite that, Forster was called into serious action only twice. Denswil tested him with an early 30-yard free kick, which was pushed behind by the keeper. More impressively, he sprung to his right to tip De Jong's downward header round the post following a terrific cross by Ricardo van Rhijn. Celtic failed to trouble Jasper Cillessen in the opening period, but should have done so just a minute before Schone struck for Ajax. Beram Kayal was allowed to run from the halfway line as far as the edge of the Ajax penalty area, as Anthony Stokes's clever run dragged defenders away, but the midfielder's shot, under little pressure, flew wildly over. That miss felt all the more painful as Schone made the breakthrough and though Stokes made Cillessen work shortly afterwards, the striker's effort from the left of the penalty area was comfortably held by the Dutch international. On a bitterly disappointing evening for Celtic, only Forster and the immense Virgil van Dijk earned pass-marks and Neil Lennon will know much improvement is required if Champions League progress is to remain a reality. </body>

      <body>Wet weather prevented any play on day two of England's second Ashes warm-up game with Australia A in Hobart. Heavy rain delayed the scheduled 23:00 GMT start before play was finally abandoned at 05:20 GMT because the bowler's run-up area at the southern end was judged too wet. The final two days of play will start half an hour earlier at 22:30 GMT. England are 318-0, with captain Alastair Cook on 154 and fellow left-hander Michael Carberry on 153. The openers batted through day one after Cook won the toss. England, who drew their opening tour match against a Western Australia Chairman's XI in Perth, complete their preparations for the first Test with a four-game against a New South Wales XI in Sydney. Meanwhile Australian batsmen David Warner and Michael Clarke were able to gain some valuable match practice in the sunshine at Melbourne for New South Wales against Victoria in the Sheffield Shield. Left-handed opener Warner struck 16 fours in 104 from 87 balls, sharing 104 with skipper Clarke, fit again after recent back trouble, who struck 43 off 79 balls with six boundaries. The first Ashes Test starts in Brisbane on 21 November. </body>

      <title>Are children given too many toys?</title>
      <description>Retailers are starting to gear up to sell the latest generation of Christmas toys, but do children get too many?</description>

      <body>Retailers are starting to gear up to sell the latest generation of Christmas toys, but some campaigners are advocating a change in attitude. Do some Western children have too many toys, asks Joanne Furniss. I stood in the playroom holding an empty suitcase. We were emigrating and could only pack a few toys to keep us going until the rest arrived by ship months later. In went the Story Cubes - ingenious picture dice that inspire stories, drawings or full-scale theatrical productions. Both kids are "crafty", so in go pom-poms, pipe cleaners and paper punches. Next, a kingdom of animal figurines marches two-by-two into the case. I subject the rest to an eligibility test before I transport them half way round the world from Switzerland to Singapore - has either child shown the slightest interest in the toy in the past month? An ancient game of Pass the Pigs passes muster. A bucket of unisex Duplo and then, after a tantrum, a second bucket of pink Duplo. At the last minute, I spot a "snakes and ladders" game that my son enjoys (provided he gets to take all the turns). But the rest has not been touched in a month - and the shelves are still packed with dolls and jigsaws and trains and kazoos and knitted muffins and the emergency vehicles of several nations and enough wooden blocks to build a bridge to Singapore. So why do we have so many toys? Psychologist Oliver James, author of the parenting book Love Bombing, believes children don't "need" a vast panoply of toys. "Most children need a transition object," said James, "their first teddy bear that they take everywhere. But everything else is a socially generated want." It seems we are keen to generate our children's wants - the Toy Retailers Association reports that the British alone spend £3bn each year on toys. At London's VandA Museum of Childhood, Catherine Howell oversees a collection that includes a 400-year-old rocking horse and Buzz Lightyear. She agrees that children typically have far more toys than any previous generation. But while spin-off merchandising has been a huge hit ever since Star Wars figures appeared in the 1970s, Howell says traditional toys like dolls and building blocks have retained a consistent popularity. "A child always comes back to a set of bricks because it allows them to use their imagination." Certainly, my own three-year-old is a marketer's dream, desperate to adventure with the Octonauts (an animated series). And yet, when his much-anticipated Gup-B arrived last Christmas, his underwater enthusiasm had ebbed by Boxing Day. According to James, toys that pre-determine play - and this is especially true of merchandising - offer limited possibilities for fun. So while Buzz Lightyear can only ever be a space ranger, a doll might become a hungry baby, a tea party guest - or a space ranger - depending on the child's desires. These prescriptive toys could even be damaging, says James. "Young children discover their identity through fantasy play. If their toys offer a limited repertoire, this process is eroded." It is the "play value" that is most important, says Liat Hughes Joshi, author of Raising Children: the Primary Years. "There are enormous benefits to toys - they bring joy, creativity and learning." She sees three factors that make a brilliant toy: "Social value - a dolls' house allows children to play together, versatility - Lego bricks can be made into anything, and durability - such as a wooden train track that the child will use for years." But James says it's even better for children to "colonise objects". A quick glance into the bedroom shows me that my two have recently colonised my baking trays (drums), towels and pegs (den) and a large plastic storage box (my son's ark, decorated with a portrait of God). It also explains their fascination with sticks, the Swiss Army knife of the imaginary world. The sheer creative potential offered by found objects is a force that toymakers do try to harness. That old favourite, Meccano, recently won an award that recognises the traditional value of toys. Thierry Bourret, the founder of the Slow Toy Awards, says there are many ways that well-designed products surpass "colonised objects", but one in particular is crucial. "How do you know an object is safe? Every toy we recognise has been safety tested and develops life skills." Other 2013 Slow Toy winners included a stylish Danish-designed dolls pram, a set of ecological building blocks called TWIG, and a classic trike. But how many toys is too many? Those who advocate fewer toys say it is not just the nature but also the sheer number that threaten to overwhelm our children. And for parents who think that sibling rivals will bicker less if they have a wide choice of novelties - more toys could actually make them more selfish. Joshua Becker, a father of two who writes about how to simplify both home and lifestyle, says: "People co-operate better and share when resources are limited, and the same is true for children." This minimalism extends to the whole Becker family, with the kids given a confined space to store their toys, forcing them to adopt a "one in, one out" policy. He sees his kids "filling their time with creativity" - taking their scooters to the park, practising baseball and football, inviting friends over to play with dolls, and devising art projects. In addition, he says, they develop longer attention spans, take better care of their possessions and grow more resourceful. Crucially, Becker hopes these habits will last a lifetime. "The children realise they don't have to conform and be consumed by consumerism." In his book Affluenza, James outlines how the populations of the UK and the US suffer a high degree of emotional distress related to the kind of materialism that Becker rejects. Meanwhile, residents of continental Europe are only half as likely to be plunged into misery by their frustrated desire for more stuff. Is it a coincidence that the educational cultures of mainland Europe promote real-life learning experiences? The forest playgroup - or Waldspielgruppe - is a rite of passage in Switzerland, where I lived for seven years. Starting at age three, my kids toddled off to nail their lumberjack skills with normal-sized hammers and saws. They built fires, cooked food and collected soggy pine cones. There was not a toy in sight. Just contented children - and a wealth of pine cone-themed ornaments. Now that Swiss cold-snaps have been replaced by Singaporean monsoons, I'm grateful I didn't leave all the toys behind. Maybe the kids don't need them - but their busy parents do. The move forced us (willingly) to minimalise, and with all those empty packing boxes waiting to be colonised, we're not short of ways to play more with less.

      <title>Why Hitler put 'degenerate' art on show</title>
      <description>In 1937 Germany held an exhibition of "degenerate art" - some of which was rediscovered in a Munich flat this week. What was the point of the show?</description>

      <body>This week it was revealed that a huge stash of modern art had been found in a flat in Munich. Many of the paintings were considered "degenerate" by the Nazis, who staged an exhibition especially to ridicule them. Why did Hitler hate abstract art so much? In July 1937, four years after it came to power, the Nazi party put on two art exhibitions in Munich. The Great German Art Exhibition was designed to show works that Hitler approved of - depicting statuesque blonde nudes along with idealised soldiers and landscapes. The second exhibition, just down the road, showed the other side of German art - modern, abstract, non-representational - or as the Nazis saw it, "degenerate". The Degenerate Art Exhibition included works by some of the great international names - Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Wassily Kandinsky - along with famous German artists of the time such Max Beckmann, Emil Nolde and Georg Grosz. The exhibition handbook explained that the aim of the show was to "reveal the philosophical, political, racial and moral goals and intentions behind this movement, and the driving forces of corruption which follow them". Works were included "if they were abstract or expressionistic, but also in certain cases if the work was by a Jewish artist," says Jonathan Petropoulos, professor of European History at Claremont McKenna College and author of several books on art and politics in the Third Reich. He says the exhibition was laid out with the deliberate intention of encouraging a negative reaction. "The pictures were hung askew, there was graffiti on the walls, which insulted the art and the artists, and made claims that made this art seem outlandish, ridiculous." British artist Robert Medley went to see the show. "It was enormously crowded and all the pictures hung like some kind of provincial auction room where the things had been simply slapped up on the wall regardless to create the effect that this was worthless stuff," he says. Hitler had been an artist before he was a politician - but the realistic paintings of buildings and landscapes that he preferred had been dismissed by the art establishment in favour of abstract and modern styles. So the Degenerate Art Exhibition was his moment to get his revenge. He had made a speech about it that summer, saying "works of art which cannot be understood in themselves but need some pretentious instruction book to justify their existence will never again find their way to the German people". The Nazis claimed that degenerate art was the product of Jews and Bolsheviks, although only six of the 112 artists featured in the exhibition were actually Jewish. The art was divided into different rooms by category - art that was blasphemous, art by Jewish or communist artists, art that criticised German soldiers, art that offended the honour of German women. One room featured entirely abstract paintings, and was labelled "the insanity room". "In the paintings and drawings of this chamber of horrors there is no telling what was in the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or the pencil," reads the entry in the exhibition handbook. The idea of the exhibition was not just to mock modern art, but to encourage the viewers to see it as a symptom of an evil plot against the German people. The curators went to some lengths to get the message across, hiring actors to mingle with the crowds and criticise the exhibits. The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors - three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition. Some realised it could be their last chance to see this kind of art in Germany, while others endorsed Hitler's views. Many people also came because of the air of scandal around the show - and it wasn't just Nazi sympathisers who found the art off-putting. Fritz Lustig was a young Jewish apprentice who went along to see the works of art. He says "they didn't seem to mean very much - if they were portraits they seemed to distort the faces... if they were things, they seemed to be quite different from what the things really looked like - I mean the word degenerate seemed to me to apply". The exhibition went on tour all over Germany, where it was seen by a million more people. Some of the art was later burned by the Nazis, and for many of the artists this was only the beginning of very hard times ahead. But Petropoulos says that for some, being banned by the Nazis turned out to have a positive side. "This artwork became more attractive abroad, or certainly in anti-Nazi circles it gained values because the Nazis opposed it, and I think that over the longer run it was good for modern art to be viewed as something that the Nazis detested and hated." Some of the artists featured in the exhibition are now considered among the greats of modern art. Lustig, who later fled the Nazis to settle in England, now enjoys the art that he once thought was degenerate. "Well, I have grown up since that - I was pretty young and I hadn't seen all that much art - I've changed my mind since then," he says. "I can appreciate modern art much better now than I did then. It's not meant to be beautiful is it?" Lucy Burns was reporting for Witness - which airs weekdays on BBC World Service radio. You can hear her report on degenerate art here.

      <title>10 ways to prevent plane bird strikes</title>

      <body>Hardly a week goes by without a plane somewhere in the US making an emergency landing after hitting birds. As these incidents reach record levels, airports are coming up with increasingly imaginative ways of combating them. A Southwest Airlines plane recently made an emergency return to Tennessee's Nashville International Airport after hitting birds at take-off. There was a similar incident at Chicago's O'Hare Airport a few weeks ago and another involving an Alaska Airlines flight that made an emergency landing in Oakland while en route to Honolulu. According to a report by the Federal Aviation Administration, the number of bird strikes has increased nearly six-fold since 1990 to a record 10,343 in 2012. This is blamed on four factors. There are larger populations of some of the birds responsible - for instance, there are twice as many Canada geese in North America now as there were in 1990. And many birds find airports to be attractive habitats. There are also more flights, quieter engines and greater awareness which has meant more rigorous reporting. After a US Airways plane was downed by geese and had to land in the Hudson in New York in 2009 - making pilot Chesley Sullenberger an overnight international hero - reports of bird strikes spiked. But in recent years, bird-strike damage to aircraft in the vicinity of airports has fallen, because of success in dispersing the birds, and improving aircraft design. Here's a selection of methods already used or in the pipeline. 1. Every airport in the US, and many more across the world, use pyrotechnics daily to drive the birds away, says Michael Begier, national co-ordinator of the airport wildlife hazards programme at the US Department of Agriculture. "The flash, bang kind of stuff immediately gets their attention and pushes them away." Bangers and screamers make a loud explosion, others make a whistling sound, while some emit sparks - different birds respond to different things and some even take flight at the mere sight of the wildlife vehicle. A banger shot from a pistol cartridge can travel 30-40 yards before exploding, while a 12-gauge shotgun can reach 70-100 yards. Waterfowl respond fairly well and after two or three times they relocate. Raptors can be harder to move. 2. A population of Canada geese used to live between the two runways at Salt Lake City. Not any more, says Gib Rokich, who oversees the airport's wildlife programme, due to a system of egg addling. "The goose is scared from the nest and the eggs are addled or oiled pretty much in place by picking each egg up individually and shaking them or submerging them in vegetable oil. The goose continues to sit on them but they never have a successful hatch. If she lays 10 goslings, and five survive into adulthood, then they will want to come back to the same location to nest, so you can see how it can multiply. After four years, we broke the cycle, so we still get the occasional one but they're not established any more." 3. Bird distress signals are a pretty effective way of dispersing species that cause these problems, says David Randell, director of Scarecrow, which provides systems to 20-30 British airports. Speakers mounted on a car emit the sounds of up to 20 different species, operated by a driver using a tablet-style device. 4. A border collie called Sky has been chasing birds for five years at Fort Myers, Florida. Since 1999, when dogs were first used, there has been a 17% drop in bird strikes. While the egrets, herons and moorhens can get used to pyrotechnics, they never adapt to the presence of a natural predator like Sky, says Ellen Lindblad, director of planning and environmental compliance at Southwest Florida International Airport. "She seems to love it, day after day. This is what border collies are bred for." 5. Pigs have been used to disrupt the habitat of the 10-15 California gulls that used to routinely fly over Salt Lake City airport twice a day. Wildlife services had tried harassing them without success, then someone came up with the idea of putting pigs on their island habitat, adjacent to the airport. The pigs trampled and ate the gulls' eggs and are now used for a few weeks every spring as a deterrent. The migrating gulls arrive, see the pigs waiting to eat their eggs, and then go to another location. 6. Eliminating vegetation removes a food source for birds and deters them from settling. At Salt Lake City, 70 acres of grassland was replaced this summer with ground-up asphalt. Grasshoppers, gnats and armyworms attract rodents which in turn attract raptors. An airport in Sandusky, Ohio, has experimented with different types of grass, to identify which mix is least attractive to Canada geese. 7. About 300-500 raptors are trapped and relocated each year at Salt Lake City, including red-tail hawks, barn owls and peregrine falcons. Some traps use a rodent to entice the bird and catch their feet in a noose. Others are self-operating, built on top of pigeon coops to attract larger birds - they swoop in, and a door slams shut behind them. 8. A chicken gun is used to test the durability of aircraft windscreens and engines. A thawed chicken is fired out of the gun using compressed air, in an effort to simulate the impact of a bird hitting the plane in flight. 9. Lights on aircraft could be used to increase their visibility to birds, says Begier. The idea is to manipulate the characteristics of the light by varying the pulse rates and wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum and tune these changes to specific bird species. The lights would provide an earlier warning so the birds can detect and avoid the aircraft. Some of these changes to the light might be imperceptible to humans. Evidence collected from dead birds in airports suggests they were trying to evade the planes when they were hit. "We realised that the birds are trying to make the right decision but don't have enough time so what we are trying to do with the light research is give them that time." 10.The Dutch air force is using a bird detecting radar that could eventually be adopted by civil aircraft. "We've known since WWII that radar can see birds, when they were coming across the Channel and they figured it was birds and not German bombers," says Begier. These bird detecting radars are small and mobile, and technology has come on in the last 10 years, but they can't yet identify the species or numbers. "The ability to delay a commercial flight with technology that's not quite there is the problem." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

The inquiry chaired by Sir John Chilcot had hoped to begin contacting those likely to be criticised in its report this autumn, to allow them to respond. But it said it had not yet agreed with the government over the publication of the most "difficult documents". The inquiry began its work in 2009. In a statement on the inquiry's website, Sir John said the next phase of its work was "dependent on the satisfactory completion of discussions between the inquiry and the government on disclosure of material that the inquiry wishes to include in its report or publish alongside it". He added: "Since June this year the inquiry has submitted 10 requests covering some 200 cabinet-level discussions, 25 notes from Mr Blair to President Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between either Mr Blair or Mr [Gordon] Brown and President Bush. "The inquiry secretariat has responded to a number of Cabinet Office questions on those requests, but the government and the inquiry have not reached a final position on the disclosure of these more difficult categories of document." Sir John has written to Prime Minister David Cameron to express his regret that no agreement has yet been reached. In his reply, the prime minister acknowledged the progress that had been made and said he was "aware of the scale of the task declassification has presented to a number of government departments". He added: "I appreciate consideration of the disclosure requests for the remaining sensitive categories of information must be handled sensitively and carefully but I hope that consideration of the final sets of papers can be concluded as soon as possible." A spokeswoman for No 10 said she had nothing to add to the prime minister's letter. The Cabinet Office has released a statement saying "discussions are continuing between the government and the inquiry about the disclosure of records". BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said this was the latest in a series of delays to the long-running inquiry. The inquiry, which is examining the background to the UK's involvement in the 2003 invasion and its aftermath, has never set a firm deadline for publishing its final report - set to be about a million words long. However, it was initially expected to be published in 2012. </body>

      <title>Call for national care loans scheme</title>
      <description>A national deferred payment scheme to help people pay for their social care costs in old age should be created by ministers, councils in England say.</description>

      <body>A national deferred payment scheme to help people pay for their social care costs in old age should be created by ministers, English councils have urged. The Local Government Association said the government could set up a company to lend money which would be paid back from a person's estate when they die. Such a scheme is already run by several local authorities and the government is keen to create a nationwide system. But the LGA says the government should underwrite it, rather than councils. The government has said it would decide who would underwrite such a scheme in the new year. The LGA says the government should underwrite a national scheme because budget cuts mean councils do not have the money. LGA chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said: "Deferred payment schemes can offer peace of mind to people worried about how they are going to pay for care in old age. "This is an option which councils would like to be able to offer to as many people as possible but we have limited funds that restrict us from doing so. "We suggest that government considers an option for a separate national organisation, similar to the Student Loans Company, to run the deferred payment scheme on behalf of councils. "This needs to be part of a huge overhaul of the system that brings care up to a standard fit for the 21st Century and ensures that our increasingly ageing population can lead happy, healthy independent lives long into their old age." The proposal has been put forward by the LGA along with two other local government bodies, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (Solace). Solace chair Joanna Killian said the government's changes to social care needed to be adequately funded. ADASS president Sandie Keene added: "Funding is of paramount importance in ensuring that older people's wellbeing, safety and security lie at the heart of a modern, integrated and effective social care system. "The proposals we have put forward alongside colleague associations will help towards that end." BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan said that in the fiendishly complicated world of who pays for what in adult social care this proposal was at least easy to understand. Ministers have also said they will be giving councils £335m to help implement social care changes which include the £72,000 cap on what individuals would be expected to pay from 2016. </body>

      <title>BAE cuts 1,775 jobs at UK yards</title>
      <description>BAE Systems is to cut 1,775 jobs at its yards in Scotland and England and end shipbuilding altogether at Portsmouth.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24831779</url>

      <body>BAE Systems is to cut 1,775 jobs at its yards in Scotland and England and end shipbuilding altogether at Portsmouth. The firm said 940 staff posts and 170 agency workers will go at the Portsmouth site, which will retain repairs and maintenance work. Some 835 jobs will be lost at yards in Govan and Scotstoun, on the River Clyde in Glasgow, and Rosyth in Fife and at the firm's Filton office, near Bristol. The cuts follow a drop in work after the end of aircraft carriers work. BAE Systems employs a total of 4,400 people in shipbuilding in the UK, 1,200 in Portsmouth and 3,200 across Govan, Scotstoun, Rosyth and Filton. The company said it had made the cuts because of a "significant" drop in demand. The defence contractor and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have together announced measures which they hope will offset the effect of the job cuts. Among the plans are more than £100m of investment to expand the dockyard at Portsmouth. Three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal Navy will also be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. This could help sustain shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 Global Combat ships. BAE, which heads a consortium that includes Babcock and Thales UK, said it had agreed changes to the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier contract it signed with the MoD in 2009. This would see the consortium's fee move to a 50-50 risk share arrangement which would provide greater cost performance incentives. A statement released by BAE Systems said: "Under these proposals, shipbuilding operations at Portsmouth will cease in the second half of 2014. "Subject to consultation, Lower Block 05 and Upper Blocks 07 and 14 of the second Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier will be allocated to Glasgow. "The company remains committed to continued investment in the Portsmouth area as the centre of its Maritime Services and high-end naval equipment and combat systems business." BAE said it had agreed with the MoD "that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships". "The company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy," BAE said. It said the cost of this restructuring would be borne by the MoD. BAE said it would now begin consultation to cut 1,775 jobs "to result from these restructuring proposals". This would see 940 posts go in Portsmouth in 2014 and 835 across Filton, Glasgow and Rosyth, through to 2016. The statement added: "The implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain BAE Systems' capability to deliver complex warships for the Royal Navy and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the UK." The MoD confirmed that it would commission three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels to play "a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti smuggling operations". These will be built, it said, at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. Work on the new vessels is due to begin next year with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017. The ships are expected to replace the current, smaller River Class vessels which have been policing the UK's waters since 2003. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: "This deal will provide the Royal Navy with three brand new maritime patrol vessels with a wide range of capabilities which will support our national interests and those of our overseas territories. "This is an investment not only in three ships but in this country's warship building industry. It prevents workers standing idle and sustains the vital skills needed to build the planned Type 26 frigate in the future." Mr Hammond is also announcing that more than £100m will be invested in Portsmouth. The money will be used to expand the dockyard to ensure it is ready for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales as well as the Type 45 destroyers which are based in Portsmouth. The defence secretary added: "I am also pleased to announce additional investment in Portsmouth Naval Base to prepare for the significant increase in tonnage as the home port for the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers and destroyers." The MoD said under the terms of the new arrangements that "Portsmouth will maintain its proud maritime heritage as the home of much of the Royal Navy's surface fleet and the centre of BAE Systems ship support and maintenance business". Speaking at Prime Minister's questions in the Commons, David Cameron said his thoughts were with the workers affected by these "extremely difficult decisions". He added: "We want our Royal Navy to have the best and most modern ships and the best technology. "That means we will go on building warships on the Clyde, we will be announcing three new offshore patrol vessels, keeping that yard busy rather than paying for it to remain idle as the last government proposed. "In Portsmouth, yes there will be job reductions, but there are many more people involved in ship servicing than in ship building, so the workforce will go from 12,000 to 11,000." Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said it was "a difficult day" for the shipbuilding industry and his first thoughts were with those facing job losses. He added: "Two things are clear. Firstly, the MoD is to meet the cost of restructuring the naval shipbuilding business across Britain. We need to see all of the detail about how much that will cost and how the cost will be met. "Secondly, Britain must retain a sovereign shipbuilding capability. None of us want to see Scotland leave the United Kingdom, but we need clarity from the government about what safeguards are in place to meet all eventualities after next year's referendum." Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC she was relieved Govan was not closing, but said the 800 job losses were a "devastating blow" for the Clyde and Scottish economy. "The Scottish government will be working very closely with the company and with the trade unions, firstly to minimise the number of job losses, but also to work very hard with those affected to help them into alternative employment," she said. Ms Sturgeon the Clyde yards would be the best place to build the new Type 26 ships. She said: "The investment that we've seen in the Clyde yards in recent years, the skill mix of the workers in the Clyde, make the Clyde the best place to build these ships - there's no doubt about that." David Hulse, GMB national officer and chair of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions' shipbuilding national committee, said the announcements had been part of a "devastating day for the UK shipbuilding industry". "We have arranged a two-day meeting with the company at Farnborough next Monday and Tuesday that will be attended by officers and shop stewards from all the yards and all the unions," he said. "This meeting will examine in detail the business case and all aspects for scheduling work in the yards to complete building the carriers, starting work on the Type 26 ships and any other work." The independent MP for Portsmouth South, Mike Hancock, said ending shipbuilding at Portsmouth would be a difficult decision to reverse. He added: "The expertise is very, very much dedicated to shipbuilding. And once they disperse the workforce in various parts of the south of England I don't think it's going to be easy to put that back together." Workers at BAE's Scotstoun and Govan yards in Glasgow were sent home for the day after being told the news. They were told by management there would be about 800 jobs lost in Scotland but no breakdown was given. Workers who left the yards said they were worried and disappointed, but that the announcement was not unexpected. Alex Taylor, 63, a plater at Govan, said: "We've known for a while that the workload isn't there to carry the amount of people that we had building the carriers, but hopefully voluntary redundancies will take up the slack." He added that those affected by the job cuts at Portsmouth were "working class guys the same as ourselves, they're just shipbuilders. "We're obviously relieved that things are looking better for the Clyde, but that doesn't mean to say that we've not got feelings for our comrades in Portsmouth." </body>

      <body>Coniston Water is regarded by many as the "spiritual home" of record breaking - a five-mile lake where Donald Campbell strove to break the world water speed record and died trying. This week Campbell's successors are aiming to follow in his wake - but what drives these daredevils to risk their lives? From all walks of life they come. Inspired by the feats of Campbell and his father, Sir Malcolm, they are taking to the water for Coniston Power Boat Records Week. For almost 100 years, Cumbria's lakes have played host to the seemingly fearless souls attempting to write their names into the record books. On Ullswater, Windermere and Coniston Water they have tried, spurred on by the likes of the Campbells and Sir Henry Segrave. The contest has run since 1970 and was moved to Coniston in 2005 when a speed limit introduced on Windermere forced them to look elsewhere. From small hydroplanes to circuit racers and offshore boats, dozens of determined entrants take on the clock over a kilometre (two-thirds of a mile) stretch of the famous lake. While junior categories will see speeds of up to 50mph (80kmh) reached, those at the top end have clocked in at almost 180mph (290kmh) in previous years. For most, the adrenaline thrills of the event, running until Friday, provide a stark contrast to their usual surroundings. "You want to be the fastest, it's that simple," says Jim Noone, matter-of-factly. The 55-year-old - the quickest man on Windermere after reaching 154.8mph (249.1kmh) in 2003 - may initially seem an unlikely world record holder. An analytical chemist based in Leeds, he spends most Monday-to-Fridays testing the composition and quality of concrete. Formerly the owner of the business, he sold it five years ago and now acts as a consultant. "It's all done in holiday time," he says about his record-breaking attempts. "I leave on a Thursday evening and am back to work on the Tuesday." He said his work and play were "very different" although "they both require a very thorough approach - you can't leave anything to chance". Mr Noone, who lives just north of Barnsley, has a strong link with Records Week having attended the very first event 43 years ago, at the age of 12 with his father. Over his 25 years of competing, he has set several world bests and is now also a member of the organising committee. "Record-setting is much more intense than racing - you don't break records at half throttle," he says. "All your senses are heightened. It's like you're floating. You can't even see any spray." It's a similar story for 40-year-old Seattle roofer JW Myers. He has set 12 world records in 20 years, including a speed of 176.1mph (283.4kmh) at Coniston last year in the H1 Unlimited class - the fastest and most powerful category of race boats. "I've never taken drugs, but I imagine this has got to be way better," he says. Company director Neil Jackson - at the controls of a high-spec B23 "Batboat" costing around £20,000 - is another drawn to the extreme nature of the sport. The 50-year-old, from Portsmouth, who has set a number of endurance records as well as the BCC Class 2 British best of 79.51mph (127.9kmh), spends his working week travelling up and down motorways visiting clients of the two firms he is involved with. "I grew up on the River Thames so I've always been interested in boats" he says. "I started 23 years ago and was involved in a safety capacity, but then I thought, 'I wouldn't mind a piece of that'. "Making a record-attempt is absolutely nerve-wracking - you're on the rev limiter so quickly and you're putting your foot through the floor because you're wanting more speed. Eighty-something miles an hour on water is rapid." But it is not just adults who are taking to the water. Swapping the classroom this week for the majestic setting of Coniston is 13-year-old Ben Jelf. Following in the footsteps of his father, grandfather and uncle, the pupil at Swadelands School in Maidstone, Kent, competes in the GT15 class - the entry level for nine to 16-year-olds. He holds the world record for the category at 44.4mph (71.4kmh) and has triumphed in British and European racing championships. "As it's a specialist sports college, my teachers are very encouraging... the racing is always more exciting than school work though," he admits. But does he ever struggle to combine school work with his sporting activities? "I'm quite disciplined about getting my homework done," he says. "I always manage to fit it all in." The racers' passion comes at a price as equipment and running costs mount up. Mr Noone, though, said he was happy to make sacrifices. "I don't have holidays and I don't spend money on the house. Every penny goes on the boat, probably £5,000-8,000 a year." But while all are agreed the sport's high speeds and technical challenges are captivating, it is not without its risks - as Mr Noone knows all too well. His 17-year-old half-brother, BJ, was killed in 1997 when he was hit by another boat. And Mr Noone himself has suffered serious injury. He was left in hospital after a crash on Windermere in 1991 in which he dislocated his shoulders and back. "The nose lifted and the boat ended up 60ft clear in the air," he says. "I wasn't strapped in so was able to propel myself out. I knew I couldn't have it land on top of me." Undeterred, he made a return the following year when he had the satisfaction of topping 103mph in his one-litre inboard hydroplane - smashing the record he had been aiming for 12 months earlier. "I had unfinished business. I had to go back," he adds. "But it can go right or wrong in just 25 seconds and the slightest bump means you can go over. The end of the run is a mix of relief and elation." </body>

      <body>Almost 400,000 people have lost their Jobseeker's allowance since sanctions for claimants were toughened last year. But are the new rules hurting those they are supposed to be helping? Peter Jones avoided a serious brain injury when he fell at work in November last year. But while he escaped with his health, his good fortune ended there - he was told not to come back to work and went to sign on. This was a month after new rules for those out of work were introduced and he was about to find out all about them. "I'd worked all my life," he says. "But they treated me as if I was cheating the system from day one. They didn't even know me." Anyone claiming Jobseeker's allowance (JSA) can be sanctioned for things such as missing a meeting with an adviser, not turning up to training or not being available for work. "If they do everything that's expected of them, they won't get sanctioned," a spokesman at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) says. Peter, who says he was applying for "five to six jobs a day", felt this was just what he was doing. He had moved from Llandudno to be near his seriously ill mother in Stafford who was in and out of hospital with brain tumours. But when he wanted to move back to Wales and look for work there, he says job centre officials 100 miles away in Stafford deemed this an "inappropriate search". He was sanctioned and did not have any income for the whole of December. He got into debt and, aged 30, moved back in with his parents. "I didn't know what to do or how to get out of it," he says. When he moved and signed on in Wales, he was sanctioned again for not attending a meeting with an adviser back in Stafford. The new regulations - which mean a minimum four-weeks without JSA for anyone deemed to have breached them - are designed to help those without a job, according to the DWP. "This is absolutely not about saving money or punishing people," the spokesman says. "Our role is to help people into work." Peter found a job as soon as he returned to Wales but, because of the sanctions, he had only received two JSA payments in the three months he was out of work. "I'm scared of ever being in that situation again," he says. And, according to the Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB), he is not alone. It says advice centres have seen a 64% increase in the number of people coming to them after being sanctioned. Invariably, the CAB says, they are desperate to get back into work. So is the new system doing what it is supposed to - helping those who want to work to do so? Not according to the CAB's chief executive Gillian Guy. "When you're already struggling to make ends meet whilst looking for work, a sanction can end up making it harder to put food on the table and adds an extra obstacle to the huge challenge of getting a job." She adds: "The regime is not only self-defeating, it is also poorly administered." For Lee Offield, 29, a 10-week sanction meant he had to turn to food banks. He had wanted to use his illustration degree to work in art therapy. After a year out of work he started a basic social care course in Bristol but had to leave half way through after his JSA was withdrawn. He was told he could not be spending enough time looking for work if he was doing a college course. Having now moved back to his home town in Devon he says the experience left with him with temporary, insecure and seasonal work instead of the social care job he had hoped for. He appealed against his sanction, won and was repaid most of the money he had been docked. While he admits he is still in debt, the money is not his overriding concern. "I could've had a career if I'd been able to continue the course," he says. "But now I don't." The union representing the frontline staff who make these sometimes life-changing decisions alleges that, since the toughening of the rules, there is an expectation they should come down hard on claimants. "There's no question that there is an overarching pressure to enforce the sanctions regime as strictly as possible," says the PCS's Charles Law. It's an accusation the DWP flatly denies. But the union claims ministers' desire to get tough has led to job centre managers pushing advisers to issue sanctions. The PCS claims there are "sanctions league tables" and that staff face the first step of a disciplinary procedure if they fail to withdraw JSA from enough claimants. The DWP insists there are no such targets and that staff want people to do all they can to find work. While at the latest count more than 40% of those who received a sanction were under 24, opposition to them among young people is not universal. "I think they can be positive," 20-year-old Joe told YMCA researchers looking into attitudes to welfare. "As long as they are still able to feed themselves." The YMCA, though, says it has "serious concerns" about how the system is being administered and its impact on the young. Jamie Allen, 23, was made redundant over the summer, losing his job installing computer systems for an IT firm. His parents - one disabled and the other her full-time carer - took out a high-interest payday loan to support him after he was sanctioned for missing a session at the job centre. He says he received a text telling him his adviser was ill and not to come in until his next scheduled session - which he did the following week. A month later, a letter informed him he would not receive any JSA for four weeks because he had missed a session on the afternoon his adviser had been ill. His mother Alyson says the text could have been misinterpreted, but that he was doing everything possible to find work - travelling for an hour to and from the nearest job centre, sometimes for two meetings a day, and applying for 128 jobs. But their appeals were met with curt responses. "We were treated as if we were nothing," Alyson says. "I know getting the loan was silly but he had no money for bus fares so couldn't get to the job centre." On average, the number of unemployed people per job vacancy has fallen from 5.6 to 4.7 in the last two years, according to the Office for National Statistics. And with the economy showing signs of recovery, the government says people should do all they can to find work. "The people who get sanctions are wilfully rejecting support for no good reason," says Esther McVey the employment minister. Nicola Clubb, who has been signing on for a year after losing her job as a college tutor, fell foul of the new rules when she failed to get an application in for a Jobcentre position before it closed. She knows she was at fault: "I screwed up and didn't apply quickly enough." A DWP spokesman said the department could not comment on individual cases but added in a statement: "The rules regarding someone's entitlement to Jobseeker's allowance - and what could happen to their benefits if they don't stick to those rules - are made very clear at the start of their claim. "We will provide jobseekers with the help and support they need to find a job, but it is only fair that in return they live up to their part of the contract. "Sanctions are used as a last resort and anyone who disagrees with a decision can appeal." </body>

      <title>Portsmouth's long shipbuilding history</title>
      <description>Five hundred years of shipbuilding history could soon be gone</description>

      <body>When shipbuilding in Portsmouth ceases next year it could signal an end to 500 years of the city's history. At its peak, more than 22,000 men and women worked at the dockyard. It has played a key role in producing Royal Navy ships that have seen battle on the seas throughout the centuries. King Alfred is thought to have instigated ship construction there as early as the 9th Century, but the first recorded warship, the Sweepstake, was built there in 1497 in what is thought by some to be the UK's first dry dock. One of its most famous ships was King Henry VIII's the Mary Rose, believed to have been named after his sister Mary Tudor. It was constructed between 1509 and 1511 but sank in 1545 while attacking a French invasion fleet. It was raised from the seabed in 1982 and now rests in a new museum in Portsmouth. Steven Gunn, lecturer in modern history at the University of Oxford, said the dockyard became increasingly vital to both Henry VII and Henry VIII as they sought to establish a more effective navy. He added: "They wanted a permanent body of royal ships which would require non-stop repair and dockyard factories, so the emergence of Portsmouth became important. "Previous kings had navies and then sold off the ships in peace time, but now there was a much larger number of permanent ships. "It was important as England's population was much lower than the big continental powers, and that continued right through to Elizabeth I and the defeat of the Spanish Armada in 1588." The dockyard continued to expand and develop so that by the middle of the 18th Century it had become one of the largest and most capable in the world. When the HMS Dreadnought was built there in the early 20th Century it marked the creation of the "modern" battleship, changing the nature of naval warfare. The yard was transformed by mass production techniques to build warships fit for a modern naval fighting force as the UK continued to invest heavily in its Navy. A symbol of when Britannia ruled the waves is still displayed at the city's dry dock - HMS Victory, from which Admiral Nelson commanded victory at the Battle of Trafalgar. It was built at another famous former Navy dockyard - Chatham, in Kent, which closed in 1984. Mr Gunn said the end of shipbuilding at Portsmouth could signify the UK's military priorities were changing. He said: "States have always thought it important to control their own production of military resistance. If Britain loses that control that says something of its aspirations to be a military power." Falling workloads led to BAE Systems announcing 18 months ago it was reviewing its shipyard, causing a shadow to loom over the city. Wednesday's announcement confirmed those worst fears with 900 jobs set to go. But it is not the first time shipbuilding has halted in the city. In 1967 construction stopped and - while repair work still continued - shipbuilding did not resume until 2003. Alex Hildred, curator of ordnance at the Mary Rose museum, said the ending of an era was a "shame" but the city's docks were always changing. She said: "It's an important place and one of the only historic ones that was still functioning, as Woolwich, Deptford, and Chatham are no longer going. "Now it's still making that important contribution to future generations in a way that people can visibly see." But Patricia Hawkins, who lives in Portsmouth and worked at the docks as a teenager, said she mourned the end of shipbuilding in the city. She said: "I was immensely proud to be continuing a family tradition and also to be involved in some small way in protecting my country from alien forces. "This closure will cause loss of skills and will have a negative effect on the city. Our leaders simply cannot afford to cut back on our defences on land, sea or air. "In order to remain secure, we need to carefully reconsider how to refurbish and reinvent our military armoury to protect the unique integrity and special values of our nation's pride, security and culture. "Never mind the politics, keep us safe from harm, keep the skills, the tradition and strategic position of our nation's premier naval base alive, keep Portsmouth afloat." </body>

      <title>Do MPs agree with Brand and Paxman?</title>
      <description>Do MPs agree with Russell Brand and Jeremy Paxman?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24832816</url>

      <body>BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman has condemned the "green-bench pantomime in Westminster" and comedian Russell Brand has criticised "the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". BBC Radio 4's PM programme asked three MPs for their views on voter apathy. Like it or not, most people's lives are run by political decisions and those political decisions are made by politicians that you elect. The trouble is that not enough people bother to go out and elect us. There's a cynicism; we don't help ourselves. Interestingly, last night I was at a dinner and an MP got up and the first thing she said was: "Before I was an MP I had a proper job." She was a youth worker. We're actually quite self-deprecating and that plays into the hands of cynical people, of which I would count Jeremy Paxman, who have this caricature of politicians as a bunch of duplicitous so-and-sos on some big gravy train, living the life of Riley. Actually being an MP is a job, it's an exceptional job, and most of us spend an awful lot of time, blood, sweat and tears, putting a lot of effort into it. I don't mind people attacking my political policies, and they can say I've got it absolutely wrong over certain things I've been doing in my constituency, or in Westminster - but this constant attack that actually all MPs are duplicitous, and we're just on this gravy train and we're good for nothing, and it's all a pantomime is deeply undermining of the democratic process, and can only switch people off from bothering to vote, particularly young people. That's why barely 40% of young people at the last election who were able to vote for the first time - 18 to 24-year-olds - actually bothered to vote, and that really is worrying for the future. [Russell Brand is] deeply destructive, actually. Watching that interview with Jeremy Paxman he's very amusing, very articulate, but it's deeply destructive, the influence on young people who think, "Gosh, Russell said we shouldn't bother to vote, let's not vote". The way not to get [turnout] to improve is to say, it's all a waste of time and to go on the champagne anarchist ego trip that Russell Brand is on. That really doesn't help. I did some work at the beginning of the century, in 2001, when the turnout in my constituency was particularly low. What I found was that people weren't apathetic about voting, they were angry. It was anger not apathy that motivated them. The problem really is that we tend to set our agenda from the Westminster bubble, so what concerns us here in Westminster.... we really don't listen, and we really don't connect to people in the community enough. So I've completely changed the way I do my politics from that experience. Now the first thing I do is listen, and people's politics really starts from the local, they care about what's happening in their home, and in their local community. Quite often I can't address the national issues that worry them: I couldn't address the issues about immigration in Barking before the last election, or the lack of social housing. But I could address the issues about the post boxes, where they were sited, or whether the rubbish was collected, or whether we had prostitution on the street corner. When I started addressing those issues that really concerned them, I connected with local people, I started to build trust, and I then got people voting again and voting for me, and seeing off [2010 BNP general election candidate for Barking] Nick Griffin. Whilst Russell Brand may be right to be fed up, the answer is not revolution. There are no great divides in principle between the three parties. By and large we're all in favour of the mixed economy, we're all by and large - with some exceptions - in favour of state education, the kind of things which were battles between different parties have disappeared. In addition to that, politics has become a question of management: can you manage the economy better than I can? The third thing, rather paradoxically, is that the information technology revolution has meant that the age of deference has been swept aside, and I'm in no doubt whatsoever that there were people in the House of Commons 20, 30, 40 years ago who were a lot less than the perfect MP, but of course in those days no-one knew. On the whole question of executive pay: 50 years ago, my mother wouldn't have had the slightest idea what the director general of the BBC was paid, and she wouldn't have thought it was her business, but now because information is better available people are better informed and inevitably people are less charitable. [Russell Brand showed] a real lack of self-awareness: everything's wrong, but absolutely no suggestions as to how it would be put right. If Russell Brand were the prime minister, imagine what kind of country it would be - if you possibly can.

      <title>Carberry's remarkable cricketing revival</title>
      <description>From county cricket journeyman to England opener</description>

      <body>Michael Carberry is in line to complete a remarkable turnaround in his career if he is chosen for England in the opening Ashes Test. Having made his only Test appearance in Bangladesh three years ago, the Hampshire batsman was almost forced to quit cricket after becoming seriously ill with a blood clot on his lung in 2010. But after qualifying as an electrician - which has occupied his last two winters - he has now established himself as favourite to open at the Gabba in Brisbane after scoring an unbeaten 154 and 78 in his first two innings on the tour. "It's been a tough couple of years," Carberry told BBC Sport. "In a strange way, it does give your cricket perspective when you're close to losing your life." It took Carberry several years to start showing the potential that would eventually lead to his place back in England's squad for the Ashes tour. He struggled to establish himself after making his first-class debut for Surrey in 2001 and joined Kent, hopeful of greater opportunity, two years later. That move did not go as he would have liked, though, and he even considered quitting cricket altogether  when he again failed to become a regular member of their side. It was his switch to Hampshire in 2006, initially on a two-year contract, that revitalised his career and he revelled in the support shown in him by Shane Warne, his new captain, to earn selection for the England A tour to Bangladesh that winter. He was also chosen for the England Lions tour to India a year later after scoring over 1,000 first class runs in 2007 and helped Hampshire win the Friends Provident Trophy in 2009 and 2010. After scoring 1,385 first-class runs in the summer that followed his Test debut in March 2010, he appeared set for a bright England future - and was selected for the England Performance Programme squad trip to Australia that winter. However, he had to withdraw after being diagnosed with the blood clot and suffering shortness of breath, which ruled him out of taking any long flights. He faced an uncertain future wondering whether he would even be able to continue playing county cricket for Hampshire. Extensive treatment forced him to miss the first half of the 2011 season while he recovered and, although he returned impressively by scoring an unbeaten 300 against Yorkshire , it was thought his England Test chance had gone. Carberry, now 33, continued to make regular runs at domestic level and established himself as one of the best fielders in the county game, developing into an explosive one-day batsman, and helping Hampshire win the double of the Friends Life Twenty20 tournament and the CB40 in 2012. He was rewarded for his consistent form by being given his one-day international debut against Australia at the end of last summer and then became a surprise choice for the Ashes tour ahead of Somerset's Nick Compton. Even after selection, he was regarded as a reserve opener in case of injury or illness, but took his opportunity by scoring a half century in the opening match against a Western Australia X1 in Perth, when England captain Alastair Cook sat out the match with a slight back strain. It earned him the chance to open alongside Cook, ahead of Yorkshire's Joe Root, in the match against Australia A in Hobart - where his unbroken 318-run stand with the captain looks to have propelled him towards selection for the first Ashes Test. </body>

      <body>"Minister in bid to shift blame for IT fiasco" is the lead in the Times which says Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan-Smith faces scathing criticism from Parliament's Public Accounts Committee for "squandering" £140m of taxpayers' money on part of the Universal Credit welfare programme. The Times claims Mr Duncan-Smith tried to blame the failings on a senior civil servant, although a spokesman for the minister denies this. "Once again officials have been named and ministers have not," a Conservative source tells the Guardian, and adds that "that will make uncomfortable reading". According to the Sun the report points to a "shocking absence of control" over IT suppliers - with secretaries signing off multi-million pound orders. The Daily Telegraph reports on a row about the publication of records of conversations of Gordon Brown and Tony Blair with former US president George W Bush - and says this has further delayed the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq War. The paper says the wrangle with Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy Heywood has been going on for five months and means that progress has been "stalled indefinitely". "Was Yasser Arafat murdered?" asks the Independent, after a Swiss forensic report suggested the former Palestinian leader could have been poisoned with polonium. The Guardian has spoken to Mr Arafat's widow, Suha, who tells the paper she remembers how her husband was "shrinking at the hospital, how in his eyes there were a lot of questions". But, says the paper, the findings do not prove that Israel murdered Mr Arafat. And it suggests the international community will have little enthusiasm for anything that could disrupt the delicate Middle East peace process. The Daily Express says home-owners are benefiting from the fastest rise in property prices for three years - with average values rocketing by almost £13,000 in the past 12 months. One estate agent tells the paper: "Price rises are being driven by an incongruous but potent mix of confidence and fear." The Daily Mail has details of a report showing that at £60bn a year Britons pay higher property taxes than any other country in the developed world. Charges such as stamp duty, council tax, capital gains and inheritance tax are worth, the paper says, 4.1% of Britain's economic output compared with only 0.9% in Germany. The Council of Mortgage Lenders tells the Daily Telegraph that the rising property market is leading to what it calls "fiscal drag" where more and more buyers are pushed into higher tax bands because ministers have not increased stamp duty thresholds. Several of the papers carry photographs of the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall draped with garlands as they visit Rishikesh on the Ganges in northern India. "Charles mellows in his hippy moment," says the Times, which muses that in February 1968 - when The Beatles went to meditate with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi - Prince Charles was still at Cambridge and "about as straight a young man as it was possible to be in the era of flower power". Now, says the paper, the prince has shown that even at the age of 64 "it's not too late for him to indulge his inner hippy". </body>

      <body>The heads of the UK's spying agencies are to face an unprecedented televised grilling by MPs. GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, MI5 director general Andrew Parker and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers will be quizzed by the Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) in public at 14:00 GMT. Intelligence chiefs have given evidence in private for many years. The questioning follows leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden which raised concerns about spying. Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought sanctuary from the US - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. Leaks also suggested its American counterpart, the National Security Agency (NSA), had bugged the phone calls of several world leaders. The ISC - chaired by former foreign secretary Sir Malcolm Rifkind - has already carried out a limited investigation into claims that GCHQ used the NSA's vast Prism programme, which gathers information from internet companies, to circumvent UK laws. Although the committee cleared the agency of any wrongdoing in the 197 specific intelligence reports it looked at, it is now undertaking a wider inquiry into whether the laws governing surveillance are adequate for the internet age. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web, has said encryption cracking by UK and US spy agencies is "appalling and foolish". Intelligence chiefs are expected to be asked about Mr Snowden, as well as subjects including terrorist threats and cybersecurity. Subjects off limits will include details of intelligence techniques and ongoing operations. Mr Parker took over as head of the security service MI5 earlier this year. MI6 is charged with gathering intelligence and GCHQ with monitoring communications. The session is expected to last an hour and a half. It will be shown on the BBC News Channel, with a short time delay to prevent anything being broadcast that might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies. The ISC, made up of senior MPs and peers, said the meeting would "give an insight into the world of intelligence and the work the agencies do on behalf of the UK". The committee said the move was "a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies". </body>

      <title>Iraq Inquiry hold-up over documents</title>

      <body>The Iraq Inquiry says it cannot proceed with the next phase of its work because key information, including correspondence between Tony Blair and George W Bush, has yet to be released. The inquiry chaired by Sir John Chilcot had hoped to begin contacting those likely to be criticised in its report this autumn, to allow them to respond. But it said it had not yet agreed with the government over the publication of the most "difficult documents". The inquiry began its work in 2009. In a statement on the inquiry's website, Sir John said the next phase of its work was "dependent on the satisfactory completion of discussions between the inquiry and the government on disclosure of material that the inquiry wishes to include in its report or publish alongside it". He added: "Since June this year the inquiry has submitted 10 requests covering some 200 cabinet-level discussions, 25 notes from Mr Blair to President Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between either Mr Blair or Mr [Gordon] Brown and President Bush. "The inquiry secretariat has responded to a number of Cabinet Office questions on those requests, but the government and the inquiry have not reached a final position on the disclosure of these more difficult categories of document." Sir John has written to Prime Minister David Cameron to express his regret that no agreement has yet been reached. In his reply, the prime minister acknowledged the progress that had been made and said he was "aware of the scale of the task declassification has presented to a number of government departments". He added: "I appreciate consideration of the disclosure requests for the remaining sensitive categories of information must be handled sensitively and carefully but I hope that consideration of the final sets of papers can be concluded as soon as possible." A spokeswoman for No 10 said she had nothing to add to the prime minister's letter. The Cabinet Office has released a statement saying "discussions are continuing between the government and the inquiry about the disclosure of records". BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said this was the latest in a series of delays to the long-running inquiry. The inquiry, which is examining the background to the UK's involvement in the 2003 invasion and its aftermath, has never set a firm deadline for publishing its final report - set to be about a million words long. However, it was initially expected to be published in 2012. </body>

      <title>Universal Credit problems 'alarming'</title>
      <description>The implementation of the flagship welfare reform has been "extraordinarily poor", MPs say, but ministers insist improvements are being made.</description>

      <body>The implementation of the government's flagship welfare reform has been "extraordinarily poor", with much of the £425m expenditure to date likely to be written off, MPs have said. The Commons Public Accounts Committee said oversight of the Universal Credit scheme had been "alarmingly weak". Warning signs were missed and there was a "fortress culture" among officials, it claimed. Ministers said there was new leadership and controls had been strengthened. The criticisms by the cross-party committee echo those by the National Audit Office - which said in September that management of the £2.3bn project had been weak and financial controls had been inefficient. Ministers have insisted the plan to consolidate six separate means-tested working age benefits into a single payment - designed to increase incentives for work - is back on track following a "reset" of the programme at the start of the year. But the committee said the project had been beset by a string of problems and still faced considerable challenges if it was to achieve its long-term objectives. It suggested much of the £425m spent up to April, about a third of which has been on computer software and other IT systems, was unlikely to have any worth in future and its value would have to be written off. Controls over suppliers, it added, had been largely absent with, in some cases, multi-million pound orders being signed off by secretarial staff. From the outset of the project in 2011, it said, senior civil servants had "failed to grasp the enormity" of the task they had been set by ministers, did not monitor progress adequately and had not intervened when issues arose. A lack of day-to-day control meant that top officials only became aware of difficulties through "ad hoc reviews" and as problems mounted, those in charge of the scheme had become "isolated and defensive". "Universal Credit is the Department for Work and Pensions' single biggest programme and enjoys cross-party support yet its implementation has been extraordinarily poor," Margaret Hodge, the Labour MP who chairs the body, said. "The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money. "Pressure to deliver a programme of this magnitude within such an ambitious timescale created a fortress culture where only good news was reported and problems were denied." Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has insisted that Universal Credit can still be rolled out to all existing and new claimants as planned by 2017 - a view endorsed by officials from the Major Projects Authority who were drafted in earlier this year to run the rule over the scheme. But the committee said the pilots conducted to date had been unsatisfactory and a target to enrol 184,000 new claimants on to the single benefit by next April would be missed. "The department will have to speed up the later stages of the programme if it is to meet the 2017 completion date but that will pose new risks," Mrs Hodge added, urging the government not to throw "good money after bad". "We believe strongly that meeting any specific timetable from now on is less important than delivering the programme successfully." Appearing before the committee in September, the top civil servant at the Department for Work and Pensions rejected suggestions the Universal Credit was launched "without a plan". Robert Devereux said the strategy behind the policy was "very clear" and the "best available" people were running it. But he accepted there had been a "let's punch through" mentality among the original management team and its leadership was changed once it became clear that a different, more reflective approach was needed. Howard Shiplee, who took over the running of the project in May, has admitted mistakes were made but said real progress was now happening and much of the existing IT systems could be used. Responding to the committee's report, the Department for Work and Pensions said Universal Credit was a "vital" reform which would ultimately bring £38bn in benefits to society by helping people into work and reducing fraud. "This report doesn't take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery," it said. "We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls." It said it did not accept "the write-off figure quoted by the committee" and expected it to be substantially less. A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith said he had "every confidence" in the team now running the programme, including Mr Devereux - whose position some newspapers have suggested is under threat. "Both the National Audit Office and the public accounts committee acknowledged a fortress mentality within the Universal Credit programme," he said. "Iain was clear back in the summer about how he and the permanent secretary took action to fix those problems." For Labour, shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves said the report was "another nail in the coffin of the government's promise to deliver Universal Credit on time and on budget", adding that "families facing a cost of living crisis need welfare reform they can trust". </body>

      <title>Many councils 'plan to increase tax'</title>

      <body>Almost a third of all English councils plan to increase council tax next year despite a government cash incentive to freeze it, a survey suggests. According to the research published by the Local Government Chronicle, Conservative-run county councils are most likely to be considering a rise. Ministers said councillors faced a choice between helping with the cost of living or increasing local taxes. But 75% of the county councils which responded said they planned a rise. Out of 354 councils, 154 responded to the survey. 53% said they would accept the extra government funding on offer - equivalent to a 1% council tax rise. On the other hand 32% said they would not accept the funding and were considering a rise - likely to be up to 1.9% since a rise of above 2% requires a referendum. 15% said they did not know. Of 27 county councils, 12 responded to the Local Government Chronicle survey, and nine of these said they would reject the extra government funding. Two said they would accept the government's funding and agree to freeze taxes for two years, and one did not know. David Hodge, chairman of the County Councils Network and leader of Surrey County Council, said counties faced a "particularly challenging set of circumstances". He said that demand for services - such as adult social care - was rising, roads had "taken a hell of a hammering" and were costly to repair and there was a "major shortage" in school places. "Central government has a choice - they can either support councils in meeting growing demand pressures via direct support or by giving councils the flexibility to raise taxes locally," he added. "We are already finding it difficult to ensure our books balance." But Local Government Minister Brandon Lewis said he would "encourage every council" to take up the offer of funding, which would be paid in financial years 2014-2015 and 2015-2016. "Over the last three years, the government has worked with councils to cut council tax by 10% in real terms," he said. "Extra funding is on the table for councils to freeze council tax for another two years. "There is a clear choice for councillors: extra help for hard-working people with the cost of living, or higher state taxation to fund more council administration." </body>

      <title>Call for national care loans scheme</title>
      <description>A national deferred payment scheme to help people pay for their social care costs in old age should be created by ministers, councils in England say.</description>

      <body>A national deferred payment scheme to help people pay for their social care costs in old age should be created by ministers, English councils have urged. The Local Government Association said the government could set up a company to lend money which would be paid back from a person's estate when they die. Such a scheme is already run by several local authorities and the government is keen to create a nationwide system. But the LGA says the government should underwrite it, rather than councils. The government has said it would decide who would underwrite such a scheme in the new year. The LGA says the government should underwrite a national scheme because budget cuts mean councils do not have the money. LGA chairman Sir Merrick Cockell said: "Deferred payment schemes can offer peace of mind to people worried about how they are going to pay for care in old age. "This is an option which councils would like to be able to offer to as many people as possible but we have limited funds that restrict us from doing so. "We suggest that government considers an option for a separate national organisation, similar to the Student Loans Company, to run the deferred payment scheme on behalf of councils. "This needs to be part of a huge overhaul of the system that brings care up to a standard fit for the 21st Century and ensures that our increasingly ageing population can lead happy, healthy independent lives long into their old age." The proposal has been put forward by the LGA along with two other local government bodies, the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services (ADASS) and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives (Solace). Solace chair Joanna Killian said the government's changes to social care needed to be adequately funded. ADASS president Sandie Keene added: "Funding is of paramount importance in ensuring that older people's wellbeing, safety and security lie at the heart of a modern, integrated and effective social care system. "The proposals we have put forward alongside colleague associations will help towards that end." BBC social affairs correspondent Michael Buchanan said that in the fiendishly complicated world of who pays for what in adult social care this proposal was at least easy to understand. Ministers have also said they will be giving councils £335m to help implement social care changes which include the £72,000 cap on what individuals would be expected to pay from 2016. </body>

      <title>Climate wavering 'not justified'</title>
      <description>Government advisers say the UK is not out of step with major nations in reducing emissions.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24834697</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70958000/jpg/_70958058_83950241.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Britain is playing its part in a worldwide bid to reduce emissions and should not weaken its proposed cuts, says a report to the UK government. The Committee on Climate Change says no change in global science or policy justifies a slackening of effort. The report was compiled after Chancellor George Osborne said the UK's competitiveness might be put at risk by leading the world in curbing emissions. The CCC research challenges this assumption. "It is not accurate to say that the UK is leading the world on this," the CCC’s chief executive David Kennedy told BBC News. "We aren’t acting alone. We have made ambitious commitments, but other countries have too – they are acting on them and developing low-carbon technologies. "Some of our European counterparts are discussing targets stricter than ours for 2030 so if we want to be part of the low-carbon revolution we will have to make sure we aren’t left behind." Mr Kennedy said China was now clearly global leader in clean technology: "China is leading the low-carbon revolution. It has committed to invest in 700 Gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2020 – that’s 10 times the whole UK power system. "They are investing in five million electric vehicles – in multiples of what we are doing here. “Even the US is cutting its emissions and is committed to doing so in coming years.” The shale gas revolution in the US has forced down emissions because gas is much less polluting than coal; the report says it is likely that the US will meet its commitment to reduce 2020 emissions by 17% on 2005 levels. It points out that China has committed to reduce carbon-intensity by 40-45% from 2005 to 2020, and introduced policies to deliver in its 12th five-year plan. With ongoing action, China’s emissions could peak in the early 2020s, the report says. It says Germany has also made medium-term commitments in line with the UK. But Mr Kennedy admitted that the world’s efforts were still nowhere near enough to keep the world on track for a high likelihood of a stable climate. The World Meteorological Organization has announced that greenhouse gases has reached another record. UNEP’s Emissions Gap report also warned that delaying emissions cuts would make the task even more expensive. The CCC was founded to advise government on how to meet the Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to reducing CO2 80% by 2050, in a step-by-step process. For several years the Chancellor has expressed fears about the impact of climate policies on the affordability of energy in the UK. At the Conservative Party conference he told The Times that Britain should not be "in front of the world" on tackling climate change. But the Climate Change Act was designed specifically to make it hard for future politicians to weaken long-term priorities when faced with political difficulty. In order to reduce the UK’s targets, there needs to have been a weakening of the science base or of international action. But the CCC’s report says: “We conclude in this report that, in respect of science, international and EU criteria, there has been no significant change in the circumstances upon which the budget was set. In this regard, there is therefore no legal or economic basis to support a change in the fourth carbon budget. A Treasury spokesman said: "We want to tackle climate change, but it should be done in a way that doesn't put huge costs on people's energy bills or destroys manufacturing jobs. The shale gas revolution in America shows you can reduce carbon emissions, bring bills down and create jobs." The committee thinks the UK is most unlikely to experience a US-style shale gas boom. The committee is concerned at the political backlash against green energy, which it believes has been fuelled by newspaper campaigns. It says renewable energy subsidies are likely to bring down energy bills in the medium term if gas prices continue to rise as many analysts forecast. Doug Parr from Greenpeace said: "The CCC reminds us that tackling climate change is as urgent as ever, but the Treasury persists with its scientifically illiterate campaign to unravel domestic climate policy. The Lib Dems must not allow a watered down fourth carbon budget." Rhian Kelly, the CBI's director for business environment, said: "It seems sensible to maintain the fourth carbon budget at this point in time. However, as the CCC suggests, it would be prudent for the Government to look again at the UK's emissions reduction pathway once EU discussions have concluded, to make sure we remain aligned." Jonathan Grant from consultant PwC said: "The Committee is right to highlight the danger of changing tack or rolling back regulations, as it could undermine business and investor confidence that long term government policy will deliver what is needed to tackle climate change. "In the short term, UK energy emissions increased 2.6% last year, much higher than GDP growth, because of an increased use of coal in power generation. The cost of wholesale transformation of energy generation and other green measures highlights the challenge that politicians are facing everywhere on climate change." Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <title>BAE cuts 1,775 jobs at UK yards</title>
      <description>BAE Systems is to cut 1,775 jobs at its yards in Scotland and England and end shipbuilding altogether at Portsmouth.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24831779</url>

      <body>BAE Systems is to cut 1,775 jobs at its yards in Scotland and England and end shipbuilding altogether at Portsmouth. The firm said 940 staff posts and 170 agency workers will go at the Portsmouth site, which will retain repairs and maintenance work. Some 835 jobs will be lost at yards in Govan and Scotstoun, on the River Clyde in Glasgow, and Rosyth in Fife and at the firm's Filton office, near Bristol. The cuts follow a drop in work after the end of aircraft carriers work. BAE Systems employs a total of 4,400 people in shipbuilding in the UK, 1,200 in Portsmouth and 3,200 across Govan, Scotstoun, Rosyth and Filton. The company said it had made the cuts because of a "significant" drop in demand. The defence contractor and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have together announced measures which they hope will offset the effect of the job cuts. Among the plans are more than £100m of investment to expand the dockyard at Portsmouth. Three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal Navy will also be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. This could help sustain shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 Global Combat ships. BAE, which heads a consortium that includes Babcock and Thales UK, said it had agreed changes to the Queen Elizabeth-class aircraft carrier contract it signed with the MoD in 2009. This would see the consortium's fee move to a 50-50 risk share arrangement which would provide greater cost performance incentives. A statement released by BAE Systems said: "Under these proposals, shipbuilding operations at Portsmouth will cease in the second half of 2014. "Subject to consultation, Lower Block 05 and Upper Blocks 07 and 14 of the second Queen Elizabeth Class Aircraft Carrier will be allocated to Glasgow. "The company remains committed to continued investment in the Portsmouth area as the centre of its Maritime Services and high-end naval equipment and combat systems business." BAE said it had agreed with the MoD "that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships". "The company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy," BAE said. It said the cost of this restructuring would be borne by the MoD. BAE said it would now begin consultation to cut 1,775 jobs "to result from these restructuring proposals". This would see 940 posts go in Portsmouth in 2014 and 835 across Filton, Glasgow and Rosyth, through to 2016. The statement added: "The implementation of these restructuring activities will sustain BAE Systems' capability to deliver complex warships for the Royal Navy and secure the employment of thousands of highly skilled employees across the UK." The MoD confirmed that it would commission three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels to play "a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti smuggling operations". These will be built, it said, at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. Work on the new vessels is due to begin next year with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017. The ships are expected to replace the current, smaller River Class vessels which have been policing the UK's waters since 2003. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said: "This deal will provide the Royal Navy with three brand new maritime patrol vessels with a wide range of capabilities which will support our national interests and those of our overseas territories. "This is an investment not only in three ships but in this country's warship building industry. It prevents workers standing idle and sustains the vital skills needed to build the planned Type 26 frigate in the future." Mr Hammond is also announcing that more than £100m will be invested in Portsmouth. The money will be used to expand the dockyard to ensure it is ready for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales as well as the Type 45 destroyers which are based in Portsmouth. The defence secretary added: "I am also pleased to announce additional investment in Portsmouth Naval Base to prepare for the significant increase in tonnage as the home port for the Royal Navy's aircraft carriers and destroyers." The MoD said under the terms of the new arrangements that "Portsmouth will maintain its proud maritime heritage as the home of much of the Royal Navy's surface fleet and the centre of BAE Systems ship support and maintenance business". Speaking at Prime Minister's questions in the Commons, David Cameron said his thoughts were with the workers affected by these "extremely difficult decisions". He added: "We want our Royal Navy to have the best and most modern ships and the best technology. "That means we will go on building warships on the Clyde, we will be announcing three new offshore patrol vessels, keeping that yard busy rather than paying for it to remain idle as the last government proposed. "In Portsmouth, yes there will be job reductions, but there are many more people involved in ship servicing than in ship building, so the workforce will go from 12,000 to 11,000." Labour's Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said it was "a difficult day" for the shipbuilding industry and his first thoughts were with those facing job losses. He added: "Two things are clear. Firstly, the MoD is to meet the cost of restructuring the naval shipbuilding business across Britain. We need to see all of the detail about how much that will cost and how the cost will be met. "Secondly, Britain must retain a sovereign shipbuilding capability. None of us want to see Scotland leave the United Kingdom, but we need clarity from the government about what safeguards are in place to meet all eventualities after next year's referendum." Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the BBC she was relieved Govan was not closing, but said the 800 job losses were a "devastating blow" for the Clyde and Scottish economy. "The Scottish government will be working very closely with the company and with the trade unions, firstly to minimise the number of job losses, but also to work very hard with those affected to help them into alternative employment," she said. Ms Sturgeon the Clyde yards would be the best place to build the new Type 26 ships. She said: "The investment that we've seen in the Clyde yards in recent years, the skill mix of the workers in the Clyde, make the Clyde the best place to build these ships - there's no doubt about that." David Hulse, GMB national officer and chair of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions' shipbuilding national committee, said the announcements had been part of a "devastating day for the UK shipbuilding industry". "We have arranged a two-day meeting with the company at Farnborough next Monday and Tuesday that will be attended by officers and shop stewards from all the yards and all the unions," he said. "This meeting will examine in detail the business case and all aspects for scheduling work in the yards to complete building the carriers, starting work on the Type 26 ships and any other work." The independent MP for Portsmouth South, Mike Hancock, said ending shipbuilding at Portsmouth would be a difficult decision to reverse. He added: "The expertise is very, very much dedicated to shipbuilding. And once they disperse the workforce in various parts of the south of England I don't think it's going to be easy to put that back together." Workers at BAE's Scotstoun and Govan yards in Glasgow were sent home for the day after being told the news. They were told by management there would be about 800 jobs lost in Scotland but no breakdown was given. Workers who left the yards said they were worried and disappointed, but that the announcement was not unexpected. Alex Taylor, 63, a plater at Govan, said: "We've known for a while that the workload isn't there to carry the amount of people that we had building the carriers, but hopefully voluntary redundancies will take up the slack." He added that those affected by the job cuts at Portsmouth were "working class guys the same as ourselves, they're just shipbuilders. "We're obviously relieved that things are looking better for the Clyde, but that doesn't mean to say that we've not got feelings for our comrades in Portsmouth." </body>

      <title>Disabled people win living fund case</title>
      <description>Five disabled people win a legal challenge to the government's decision to abolish a fund helping 19,000 severely disabled people to live independently.</description>

      <body>Five disabled people have succeeded in a legal challenge to the government's decision to abolish the Independent Living Fund. The £320m ILF currently provides support enabling nearly 19,000 severely disabled people in the UK to live independent lives in the community. The High Court ruled in April that the closure decision was lawful, but this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. The government said it was considering whether to contest the judgement. During the Court of Appeal hearing, the five argued the High Court had misinterpreted the law and there had been a lack of proper consultation by ministers over the changes. They said that, without ILF funding and support, they would be forced into residential care or lose their ability to participate in work and everyday activities on the same basis as able-bodied people. The scheme's average payout is £300 a week, and the government has said councils, which administer most social care, will take over funding this help. Ministers took the decision close the fund on 18 December last year. Court of Appeal judges Lord Justice Elias, Lord Justice Kitchin and Lord Justice McCombe allowed the challenge to the High Court's earlier ruling, quashing the original decision in favour of the government. Lord Justice McCombe said the evidence upon which the decision had been based had not given "an adequate flavour of the responses received indicating that independent living might well be put seriously in peril for a large number of people". The disabled applicants feared that the decision to close the fund and devolve the money to local authorities would lead to a reduction, or even loss, of that money, which had previously effectively been ring-fenced. Welcoming the "powerful" ruling, law firms Deighton Pierce-Glynn and Scott-Moncrieff and Associates, which represented the claimants, said their clients had "feared that the loss of their ILF support would threaten their right to live with dignity, and that they could be forced into residential care or lose their ability to work and participate in everyday activities on an equal footing with other people". The Court of Appeal decision was described as being "of major importance not just for the claimants, but for all disabled people". Minister for Disabled People Mike Penning said: "We are very pleased the Court of Appeal upheld how we undertook our consultation on the future of the fund, and they accepted that it had been carried out properly and fairly. "We are disappointed with certain aspects of today's decision, and we will be examining the judgement very carefully and considering the implications before deciding on the most appropriate way forward, which includes seeking leave to appeal." The prime minister's official spokesman added that the Department for Work and Pensions was "now considering that judgement". The Equality and Human Rights Commission was permitted by the court to intervene in the case and made submissions on the proper application of the Equality Act and UN Convention. The ILF was established in 1988, but the government decided in 2010 that it had become "no longer appropriate or sustainable" to keep running the scheme outside the mainstream social care system. The fund closed to new applicants soon afterwards. </body>

      <body>Labour has lost a vote in the House of Commons over its plan to freeze energy prices for 20 months. The proposal was rejected by 295 votes to 237 votes at the end of a debate on the pledge announced by Ed Miliband at the party's conference. Energy firms have criticised the proposal, which would take effect if Labour wins the 2015 general election. Labour's energy spokeswoman Caroline Flint said it would publish new energy efficiency proposals next year. The vote came at the end of an opposition day debate called by Labour, with Conservative and Liberal Democrat MPs joining forces to defeat the proposal. Since Labour announced the proposed freeze in September, four of the largest energy firms have announced substantial price rises, prompting calls for action from consumer groups. The government has said a price freeze could actually push up household bills and what is needed is more competition. It has also said it will review the environmental and social charges added to bills. </body>

      <description>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg is accused by ex-Tory minister Cheryl Gillan of springing policy announcements on cabinet colleagues without warning.</description>

      <body>Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has been accused of springing policy announcements on cabinet colleagues without warning. Conservative former Welsh Secretary Cheryl Gillan said such tactics were "difficult to deal with" and threatened the smooth running of government. She said any future coalition agreement should include a "no surprises" clause. The Tory MP was briefing peers on the constitutional implications of coalition government. The MP did not give specific examples of Mr Clegg's alleged surprises. The deputy PM has made interventions across a wide range of policy areas, including home affairs and education, since entering government in 2010. But Lib Dem sources said they could not think of a single example of a policy Mr Clegg had announced "without cabinet agreement". Some Conservatives were upset about Mr Clegg's recent criticism of free schools, the source added, but that had been an announcement of future Lib Dem policy, not a coalition announcement. Mrs Gillan, who was sacked as Welsh secretary in 2012 and also served as a junior education minister in John Major's Conservative government in the 1990s, said guidelines were needed when there was more than one party in government. "Because you are sat there as a secretary of state and then suddenly the deputy prime minister says something which is completely outwith anything that has ever been discussed, is not a policy area, but he makes that pronouncement in public. That is pretty difficult to deal with. It's pretty difficult to deal with if you are in a one-party government, quite frankly. "It's even more difficult to handle when you are in a coalition." If there were to be a set of guidelines on the formation of future coalitions, she told the peers, "the law of no surprises would be my first rule... or at least make sure the secretary of state in whatever department has a little bit of warning about it". Former Lib Dem Health Minister Paul Burstow agreed that it would be a "good rule". Mrs Gillan also suggested collective cabinet responsibility, the convention that dictates ministers follow the same line in public, was "no longer modern or relevant". The MP, who openly opposed government policy on the proposed HS2 rail line when she was in cabinet, said ministers should be allowed to speak more freely on certain issues. She also accused Mr Clegg of wrecking her plans for a forum for ministers responsible for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, to monitor "what was going on in the devolved administrations". "I think the deputy prime minister allowed that meeting to take place once. He chaired the first meeting. The second he handed to Danny Alexander and then he allowed it to just wither away." A Lib Dem source said Mr Clegg was "one of the biggest proponents in government" of more power for Wales and was leading the agenda on devolving more power to English cities and to Scotland. Mrs Gillan also agreed with the former Children's Minister, Tory MP Tim Loughton, that a fixed-term Parliament was key to holding the coalition together. Mr Loughton said it removed the "capacity of the junior partner to throw their toys out of the pram" and bring down the government. The MPs were appearing before the Lords constitution committee. </body>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has dismissed Labour leader Ed Miliband's claim that NHS accident and emergency services in England are in "crisis". AandE targets had been "missed for 15 consecutive weeks", Mr Miliband said. The opposition leader accused Mr Cameron of breaking his pledge that "I refuse to go back to the days when people wait for hours in AandE." But Mr Cameron said waiting times in England had fallen and criticised Labour's handling of the NHS in Wales. At the prime minister's weekly Commons question session, Mr Miliband asked whether there would be a "crisis" in the NHS this winter. Having received his response, the Labour MP commented: "The whole country will have heard that the prime minister can't guarantee that there won't be a crisis this winter in our AandE departments. "That's because there already is a crisis. "That's what the president of the Royal College says," Mr Miliband continued, "he says this, 'There are almost daily instances in most AandE departments of patients facing extended trolley waits.' "The prime minister said two years ago, 'I refuse to go back to the days when people wait for hours in AandE.' "He's broken that promise, hasn't he?" The Mr Cameron was "complacent about the AandE crisis and clueless about what is actually happening in the NHS", Mr Milband added. "What the British people know is the NHS is heading into winter with fewer nurses, a lack of senior AandE doctors and a shortage of beds. "He promised he would protect the NHS but it's now clear the NHS isn't safe in his hands." But Mr Cameron said: "AandE in this country is treating 1.2 million more patients now than under Labour and let me give him one simple fact - today in our AandEs the average waiting time is 50 minutes. "When the shadow health secretary was sitting here as health secretary the average waiting time was over 70 minutes." He added: "There are more AandE consultants working in AandE than there were five years ago. "That is why we're meeting our targets in England and that is why Labour is missing its targets in Wales." Oversight of the NHS in Wales is devolved to the Welsh government, which is led by Labour. </body>

      <title>Offering seats not sexist - Swinson</title>
      <description>Minister Jo Swinson, who prompted a debate by standing in the Commons while heavily pregnant, says it is not sexist to offer a pregnant woman a seat.</description>

      <body>Equalities Minister Jo Swinson has said she does not think it is sexist to offer a pregnant woman a seat. The heavily pregnant MP found herself at the centre of a twitter storm after reports she was forced to stand during prime minister's questions. An aide to Ms Swinson was reported as saying it was "sexist" to expect a seat to be offered. Ms Swinson declined to comment at the time but has now attempted to set the record straight in a web chat. The MP told an online discussion on Mumsnet.com: "I never said that, and absolutely don't think it is sexist. "It's lovely to be offered a seat - I don't always want one though." She continued: "On the Tube with heavy bags, often I say yes, though that day at PMQs I knew I could only be there for 15 minutes and was standing with my back against a wooden pillar very comfortably. "It was a little frustrating that the media seemed not to care whether I actually thought it was a problem or not, and deemed that if I was standing it must obviously have been because I had been 'forced' to, as they put it! "I just think it's great for people to offer, and part of life's little courtesies. Though when I was incredibly fatigued at about 10 weeks but of course didn't look pregnant was when it has been most difficult so far!" The live online discussion was focused on "body confidence". One contributor asked: "Do you agree that women should be getting angry about the cultural pressures heaped upon us and our daughters?" "Yes, we should be angry, as you say, not just for ourselves but also for our daughters," the minister responded. "Our body confidence campaign in government is trying to address some of these cultural pressures - there are also huge issues around media sexism, which I've met campaigners about recently. "Parents - and all of us - have a role to play too - both in challenging stereotypes in conversation and in our purchasing decisions, and encouraging companies and media outlets to act differently." Ms Swinson's child, her first, is due on Christmas Day, according to reports. </body>

      <title>MP goes to watchdog over trade claim</title>
      <description>Tory MP Mark Pritchard refers himself to Parliament's standards watchdog over "hurtful" claims he offered to set up business deals in Albania for money.</description>

      <body>A Conservative MP has referred himself to Parliament's standards watchdog over "hurtful" claims that he offered to set up business deals in return for hundreds of thousands of pounds. The Daily Telegraph reported that Mark Pritchard said he would be able to broker investments overseas using his political contacts in Albania. It said he asked for £3,000 a month for consultancy and 3% of any deal. But Mr Pritchard said the claims were false and he wanted to clear his name. The MP for the Wrekin in Shropshire sits on the all-party group for Albania, and the Telegraph reported that that he had told an undercover reporter posing as a businessman that he should invest £10m in a group of boutique hotels in the country. According to the terms described by the newspaper, this would have realised Mr Pritchard more than £300,000. But there is no suggestion the MP was willing to support deals in Parliament. In fact he told an undercover reporter that he did not lobby. No money changed hands. Had Mr Pritchard agreed and properly declared a contract of this sort, it is not clear whether he would have broken any rules, BBC political correspondent Ross Hawkins said. Parliament's code of conduct stipulates that an MP is not prevented "from holding a remunerated outside interest as a director, consultant, or adviser, or in any other capacity, whether or not such interests are related to membership of the House". Mr Pritchard said: "The allegations made by the Telegraph are false and I deny their claims. "They have selected quotes out of context to fit their desired story, which is both hurtful and malicious and seeking to damage me." He added: "I cannot comment further as I am consulting libel lawyers. I have asked the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards to investigate the matter". A Labour Party spokeswoman said it was "right" for Mr Pritchard to refer himself to the body. </body>

      <title>UK visa help for foreign executives</title>
      <description>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get extra help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme.</description>

      <body>Foreign business executives with "strong links" to the UK will get help to expedite their visa applications under a new Home Office scheme. About 100 "high value" executives will be invited to join the new Great Club, to ensure their immigration checks are completed "swiftly and smoothly". They will be offered personal support in navigating the immigration system, including their own "account manager". But they will still have to undergo the same checks as ordinary travellers. The 12-month pilot follows criticism that curbs on immigration are deterring wealth creators from coming to the UK. The government has made it harder for migrants from outside the EU to come to the UK unless they have specific skills as well as attempting to crack down on students and family members overstaying their visas. Home Secretary Theresa May said it would enable the UK to maintain a "competitive visa system that can innovate in order to serve the ever-changing needs of business and ensure Britain succeeds in the global race". "We will continue to listen and respond to the needs of high-value and high-priority businesses so that we can provide them with a service that supports economic growth while at the same time maintains the security of our borders." Last month, Chancellor George Osborne said the UK would be simplifying its visa procedures to make it easier for Chinese visitors to enter the country. A same-day business-oriented visa service, currently in force in India, will be introduced in China and other countries. The number of countries benefiting from a priority visa service - which enables eligible applicants to have their applications fast-tracked on paying a fee - will rise from 67 to 90 by next April. Business Secretary Vince Cable and Mayor of London Boris Johnson are among those to have warned against deterring the "brightest and the best" from coming to the UK, amid claims that tougher requirements for foreign students to stay in the UK after graduation are putting many off from coming in the first place. And plans to impose visa restrictions on Brazilians were put on hold earlier this year amid concerns that it would damage commercial links with Brazil's fast-growing economy. </body>

      <body>Political and trade union representatives are to hold a series of meetings in London later in a effort to save 300 jobs at Northern Ireland's Driver and Vehicle Agency. They will meet Transport Minister Robert Goodwill and address the Northern Ireland Select Committee. Most of the jobs are based at the DVA's Coleraine office. The delegation will also hand over a petition signed by 20,000 people in support of the workers. The coalition government is planning to move the jobs from Coleraine to Swansea in Wales in an attempt to centralise the service and save money. Ryan McKinney of NIPSA said it was "illogical to proceed with such a huge centralisation process" "The people of Coleraine and the people of this part of the world are going to defend these jobs," he said. "It's going to have a significant impact on the local economy, a knock-on impact for people, whether they work in the private sector or the public sector, as a consequence of removing at least 300 jobs from the local economy. "So if he (Goodwill) thinks he's going to make a decision that will have no political consequences for him then he's wrong." On Wednesday, Environment Minister Mark H Durkan met Mr Goodwill in London as part of his campaign to retain the jobs in Northern Ireland. Mr Goodwill joined the coalition government last month, when he was appointed as Parliamentary Under Secretary at the department. </body>

      <title>BAE workers digest job cuts news</title>
      <description>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy.</description>

      <body>Staff at BAE's shipyards are going back to work after being told that almost 1,800 of them are facing redundancy. They were sent home on Wednesday after the announcement of job cuts, which include about 800 in Scotland. Most of the jobs will go in Portsmouth where shipbuilding will end altogether. There will also be job losses in Filton, near Bristol. Unions at Scotland's shipyards said they hoped many of the job losses would be found through voluntary redundancy. The Scottish yards include Govan and Scotstoun, on the River Clyde in Glasgow, and Rosyth in Fife. The Clyde yards have been earmarked for building the new Type 26 warships. The UK government has been accused by MPs in the south-east of England of sacrificing shipbuilding in Portsmouth because of next year's independence referendum. However, the Scottish government has accused it of "absurd" threat to jobs in Glasgow in the event of a Yes vote. The Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said that in the event of independence, a UK government would be bound to want to build warships inside the UK and not in Scotland. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael said Scotland would find it "difficult" to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country voted for independence. But Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme that in an independent Scotland, joint procurement of Type 26 frigates could be possible. She said: "These ships will be built on the Clyde because BAE said yesterday, and the defence secretary said yesterday, that it's the best place to build them because of the investment we have seen in these yards, because of the skills mix and because of the value for money. "Type 26 frigates, offshore patrol vessels - these are exactly the kind of vessels that an independent Scottish government would need. So we would be procuring some of these Type 26 frigates. "Actually, the sensible proposition in that scenario would be a joint procurement." However, former Conservative Defence Minister Sir Gerald Howarth told the programme the issue was about European law. He said: "Under article 346, national security determines that if we wish to maintain exclusivity in the United Kingdom in order to maintain our sovereign capability, then we can do so. "If Scotland were no longer part of the United Kingdom, then Scotland would not enjoy that same privilege which they enjoy today. "Nor would the United Kingdom enjoy that same exemption." The defence contractor and the Ministry of Defence (MoD) have announced measures which they hope will offset the effect of the job cuts. Among the plans are more than £100m of investment to expand the dockyard at Portsmouth. Three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels for the Royal Navy will also be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards in Glasgow. This could help sustain shipbuilding at the yards until work is due to begin on the Type 26 Global Combat ships. BAE said it had agreed with the MoD "that Glasgow would be the most effective location for the manufacture of the future Type 26 ships". "The company proposes to consolidate its shipbuilding operations in Glasgow with investments in facilities to create a world-class capability, positioning it to deliver an affordable Type 26 programme for the Royal Navy," it said. It said the cost of this restructuring would be borne by the MoD. BAE said it would now begin consultation to cut 1,775 jobs "to result from these restructuring proposals". The MoD confirmed that it would commission three new ocean-going Offshore Patrol Vessels to play "a key role in counter-terrorism, counter-piracy and anti smuggling operations". It said these would be built at BAE's Govan and Scotstoun yards. Work on the new vessels is due to begin next year with the first ship being delivered to the Royal Navy in 2017. The ships are expected to replace the current, smaller River Class vessels which have been policing the UK's waters since 2003. Mr Hammond said more than £100m would be invested in Portsmouth. The money will be used to expand the dockyard to ensure it is ready for the arrival of HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales as well as the Type 45 destroyers which are based in Portsmouth. Workers at BAE's Scotstoun and Govan yards were told by management there would be about 800 jobs lost in Scotland but no breakdown was given. Workers who left the yards said they were worried and disappointed, but that the announcement was not unexpected. Alex Taylor, 63, a plater at Govan, said: "We've known for a while that the workload isn't there to carry the amount of people that we had building the carriers, but hopefully voluntary redundancies will take up the slack." He added that those affected by the job cuts at Portsmouth were "working class guys the same as ourselves, they're just shipbuilders. "We're obviously relieved that things are looking better for the Clyde, but that doesn't mean to say that we've not got feelings for our comrades in Portsmouth." </body>

      <title>New sanctions see benefits suspended</title>
      <description>Nearly 19,000 people in Wales have their Jobseeker's Allowance stopped or suspended for breaking rules to ensure they actively seek work.</description>

      <body>Nearly 19,000 people in Wales have had their Jobseeker's Allowance either stopped or suspended under rules to ensure they actively seek work. Since October 2012 claimants have faced the prospect of sanctions ranging from suspension of benefits to a three-year ban if they do not not look for work. The UK government says it wants to end "the something-for-nothing culture". The charity Oxfam criticised sanctions imposed for "mundane reasons" like missing appointments through illness. There are 69,400 Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) claimants in Wales. Of those, 18,750 claimants - just over a quarter of the total - had their benefits payments suspended 26,510 times between October 2012 and June 2013. Across the UK, more than 400,000 people lost their JSA, as 580,000 sanctions were handed down. The latest figures were published by the Department for Work and Pensions. There are three levels to the new sanctions: UK employment minister Esther McVey said: "This government has always been clear that in return for claiming unemployment benefits jobseekers have a responsibility to do everything they can to get back into work. "We are ending the something-for-nothing culture. "People who are in a job know that if they don't play by the rules or fail to turn up in the morning, there might be consequences, so it's only right that people on benefits should have similar responsibilities. "We always make the rules very clear. It's only right that there is a penalty if people fail to play by them." However, Julian Rosser, head of Oxfam Cymru, said: "Tougher rules on benefit sanctions have hit more people, leaving many without food and other necessities. "We have spoken to people who have had delays and sanctions for mundane reasons, such as not having the right ink to fill an application or missing appointments due to sickness which is unacceptable. "Any sanctions system needs to operate in a way that does not push people further into poverty. "People need support not punishment. They need understanding not condemnation." Across the UK, the figures showed 53% of decisions to withdraw benefit were the result of the lowest level sanction, while 38% were intermediate and 9% at the highest level. In total, 223,000 people have so far received the lowest sanction, 167,000 the intermediate suspension and 48,000 the highest. </body>

      <title>City's shipbuilding loss 'a tragedy'</title>
      <description>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose shipbuilding has been described as a "catastrophe".</description>

      <body>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose its shipbuilding industry has been described as a "catastrophe". About 900 job losses are expected at the BAE yard, which employs about 1,200 people. The site will stay open, with a focus on repairs and maintenance, but there is no prospect of new ships. For the south coast port, which considers itself the home of the Royal Navy, it is a big blow. The city's maritime links are clear for any visitor to see. Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose, HMS Victory, from which Admiral Nelson commanded victory at the Battle of Trafalgar and the battleship HMS Warrior are proudly displayed in the city's dockyard. The Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers will be based at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard - which was under threat a few years ago. Losing shipbuilding will be felt far and wide across the Solent region. Many workers said they had been "forbidden" to speak to the media as they left the Portsmouth yard following the announcement. But one, who did not want to be named, described a "bad mood" among staff. "Basically there's about six months work left," he said. "It's not really unexpected, we knew it was coming." Another added: "It's a sad day for the loss of work in the South yet again. "[It's] a political decision for Scotland to have all the work and us have nothing." The mood in Portsmouth earlier matched those of the workers. Derek Brown, who started 40 years of work as a shipwright when he was 15, said: "For years it's been run down but it's unfortunate a lot of people will lose their jobs - people with mortgages and bills to pay. "When I first went in there was 22,000 people working in there. It was a job for life then but times change." Patricia Hawkins added: "Portsmouth will be a ghost town. We'll end up with a museum not a dockyard and what happens when we need ships to go to war again?" Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said the news was a "personal tragedy for everyone who's going into work in the yard today". He added: "And that's a personal tragedy for them and a catastrophe for the city of Portsmouth to lose so many highly-skilled jobs which will be virtually impossible to replace in that line. "I think it's a national disgrace that we're going put all their expertise and investment that's gone into the yard in Portsmouth at risk by closing it down and putting all your eggs into one basket." Ian Woodland, South East regional officer for the Unite union, said the news means skilled workers will be left on the "scrap heap". "[The] Tories are clueless about how to deal with BAE job losses in Portsmouth. Where will these people work?," he said. "There are no jobs for these workers. "BAE job losses in Portsmouth will affect [the] whole of Solent area. Many BAE employees [also] live in Southampton." Maureen Frost, executive director of Hampshire Chamber of Commerce, said it would be working with the city council to try and help those affected. "Losing the shipbuilding side is devastating news for the city," she added. "It's also about the supply chain and those small businesses that supply into BAE Systems so there's going to be a major impact. "It may not just be one person in one family, with the tradition of shipbuilding here sometimes it's the whole family involved." BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago when it became apparent that future work, following the completion of the new aircraft carriers, was unlikely to sustain yards in Portsmouth as well as Govan and Scotstoun in Scotland. And it is Portsmouth that will make way. </body>

      <title>HS2 : Which cities to benefit?</title>
      <description>A new report says Nottingham and Derby will benefit the most from HS2.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24747301</url>
      <date>1383151268</date>

      <body>Like anyone with a favourite train set, David Cameron isn't about to give up on HS2. In Prime Minister's Questions, he robustly defended the need for a high-speed rail link. With Labour now questioning the overall cost, HS2 supporters may be getting rather nervous. That explains why the government has published another document - the fifth so far - on the benefits for our big cities. This time, the key message is the economic spin-offs, rather than the shorter journey times promised by the new line to London. And tucked away in the details of the Department for Transport's "Strategic Case for HS2" is the finding of a KPMG audit of the benefits for the regions. Its model is based on improved connectivity: how businesses are able to connect with suppliers and potential customers. Its findings put a figure on that, and guess what: Nottingham and Derby emerge as the "city region" that will benefit the most from high speed rail. The KPMG conclusion estimates a big improvement in business connectivity. This is the league table for the city regions along the route: The government's HS2 report also estimates what that could be worth for the Nottingham/Derby economy: an extra £2.2bn a year. But does that still make HS2 worth it? That's where the political and economic debate still remains. "We are always supportive of infrastructure projects, even HS2. But they have to provide good value for money," Ron Lynch, head of the business organisation, the Institute of the Directors in the East Midlands, said. HS2 opponent and Tory MP Andrew Bridgen believes Labour doubts over the £42bn cost now put the whole idea in doubt. The proposed route would cut through his North West Leicestershire constituency, with an HS2 rail tunnel going under East Midlands Airport. "A whole raft of independent bodies - even the Treasury Select Committee a couple of weeks ago - said there is no business case for HS2 and that it should be suspended," he told me. Labour's current position is best summed up by Shadow Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood, herself a Nottingham MP. "We are in favour, but the government can't be irresponsible about the cost. They've got to keep that cost under control and they've got to demonstrate to the public it's value for money," she said. When the East Midlands HS2 station - between Derby and Nottingham - is built at Toton Sidings, London will be 51 minutes away, it will be 19 minutes to Birmingham, and it'll be one hour 42 minutes to Newcastle. It's that prospect of such shorter journey times and the economic advantages that attract the leader of Nottingham City Council, Labour's Jon Collins. "There's an opportunity for us to get a rebalancing of the economy, so that not all the growth is happening in and around London and South East, " he said. "We'll see significant economic growth and economic benefits coming to the Midlands and the North from HS2. That's why people should strongly support it." In the national debate over the economic spin-offs for the English regions, the advantage for Nottingham and Derby has barely figured. The two cities' top position in the HS2 economic benefits league table may surprise many. But ponder this: at the last general election, the East Midlands helped deliver David Cameron into Downing Street. The East Midlands may help deliver HS2 for the prime minister, if the economic case for this region wins over the sceptics. </body>

      <title>Will UKIP factor become UKIP fact?</title>
      <description>Will West Midlands voters turn to UKIP when the looming elections come around and if so how will it affect the other parties?</description>

      <body>"Predictions in politics are inherently unreliable because they are, by definition, merely projections of the present". So said the late lamented doyen of journalists, authors and satirists, Malcolm Muggeridge. His words of wisdom offer a timely warning to any of us who may be tempted to scan the daily outpourings of opinion pollsters in the hope of divining the likely outcome of the 2015 General Election. What if, for example, the 2014/15 winter is plagued by power cuts? Or further hikes in energy prices? Aren't these exactly the sorts of shocks, (absolutely no pun intended) that could lead to the number-crunchers themselves being given a good crunching? But I mustn't fall into exactly the same trap St Mugg was warning us about: just because energy is the "hot button" issue now doesn't mean that it will be equally highly-charged in 18 months' time. If Muggeridge were around today, he would probably urge us to be just as circumspect about the so-called 'UKIP factor'. Suitably forewarned and forearmed, here goes: The conventional wisdom is that it will. A poll by the former Conservative deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft recently suggested UKIP could draw so much support from Tories in marginal seats they might otherwise win from Labour, and in others that they might otherwise hold, that a new slogan was born: "Vote UKIP, get Labour". A less fashionable view comes from the West Midlands MEP Mike Nattrass. Elected as a UKIP MEP, he resigned from the party last month and now sits as an Independent. He says UKIP's immigration policies will hit Ed Miliband's party hardest of all in their key seats. Incidentally, Mr Nattrass currently sits as an Independent MEP in the European Parliament. Which means both the successful UKIP candidates in the last European Elections in 2009 have now left the party to form new ones: Nikki Sinclaire will be standing for the We Demand a Referendum Now Party. We all know about "Super Tuesday" in the US Presidential merry-go-round. But save the date: Thursday, 22 May, 2014 will see polling not only for hundreds of seats in 19 local authorities across our region, but also for the seven seats representing nearly six million West Midlanders in the next European Parliament. Part of the calculation is that by delaying the council elections so that they fall on the same day, each set of elections will bolster turnouts in the other. UKIP's poll ratings encourage them to believe they can improve on the two European seats they secured last time. They hope this would give them a stronger springboard into 2015 than they managed last time. By the time of the 2010 general election they suffered the dreaded "squeeze" so often endured by the "smaller parties" and fell back to just 4% of the vote. Even allowing for Muggeridge's warnings, UKIP's recent poll ratings certainly encourage them to believe they are on the brink of a fundamental shift in British politics which mean they are a "smaller party" no longer. There is no question that UKIP have broadened their message beyond their original single issue campaign: I have marvelled at how effectively they rallied their popular (or should that be populist?) campaigns themes; emphasising their anti High-Speed Rail credentials in some places and their pro-local hospital commitments in others. How will all this gel together into a coherent theme for next year's European Elections? That will be one of the questions I shall be putting to Jill Seymour, the chair of Kynnerlsey Parish Council in Shropshire. But more to the point she was also recently named in first position on UKIP's candidates' list for next May. And she will be one of my guests on this week's Sunday Politics from 11.00 on BBC One in the West Midlands. And I hope you will be able to join us too. </body>

      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said the BAE job losses would be very hard to replace and described the news as "depressing, disappointing and pretty upsetting". He said it would result in 500 years of tradition being swept away. He spoke to Andrew Neil as BAE Systems confirmed 940 staff and contractor posts would go at the Portsmouth site and a further 835 jobs would be lost at yards in Govan and Scotstoun in Glasgow, Rosyth in Fife and Filton, near Bristol.

      <body>Ed Miliband asked the prime minister if he could guarantee there would be no "NHS crisis this winter". David Cameron sad the NHS was treating 1.2 million more people than under the last Labour government, and it had met AandE targets for 27 weeks in a row. And he claimed there was an NHS crisis "every days of the week" for NHS services in Wales where Labour was in charge. At PMQs, the pair clashed over NHS services and targets, redundancy figures, and the numbers of doctors, nurses and health visitors. </body>

      <body>School dinners have improved but there should be a drive to get more children eating them as the take-up remains stubbornly low, an association of school caterers says. Free schools and academies are currently exempt from the government's nutritional guidelines, but research found 92% of parents wanted to see the same standards applied to all schools. The chair of the Lead Association for Catering in Education said people still remember soggy cabbage and lumpy custard, but reckoned "there has been really good hard work" to improve the food, and that: "We are finally cooking on gas". Anne Bull said only 1% of packed lunches meet nutritional standards for school food, and that hot school meals were "by far the best option". Mrs Bull will be a guest on BBC2's Daily Politics where she will discuss the film at around 12:40 GMT.

      <description>Fact mirrors fiction as spy chiefs face the cameras</description>

      <body>When Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) quizzes the three heads of the UK intelligence agencies later it will be the first such meeting in public. Fact often mirrors fiction in the world of spies. Before Thursday, if you had wanted to see British spy chiefs appear before parliamentarians and the cameras, your only opportunity would have been in the last James Bond film, Skyfall. Dame Judi Dench, playing M, had just lectured the assembled audience about why spies were still needed in the modern world when the villain of the tale burst into the room with guns blazing. Security is going to be tight in Parliament but no-one is quite expecting such a dramatic afternoon. The real-life hearing may be missing Dame Judi but it still will, in part, be about theatre and performance. Despite the presence of so many people who know so much, no-one should expect any secrets to be spilled. That is not the intention of the hearing - it is, rather, part of a wider effort both by spies and by those who scrutinise them to provide greater transparency about their work. And if any secrets do somehow slip out then the two-minute time delay on the TV feed means the outside world may well be prevented from hearing them. The hearing is only an hour and a half long; so the level of detail will be limited. Each head will want to discuss how they see the threats and explain what their organisation is doing to counter them. The three spy chiefs are all different characters. The chief of MI6, Sir John Sawers - often known as "C" rather than M - spent most of his career in the Foreign Office; so he is not a stranger to the TV cameras. Andrew Parker, from MI5, is new in the role but has been in the upper echelons of MI5 for many years. Sir Iain Lobban, of GCHQ, faces the hardest task. He has been running his agency for longer than either of the others but historically it has been the most secret and the least outward-facing. Or at least it was until the past few months, when former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden began spilling its secrets, drawing its work into the spotlight as never before. The spies have already been giving evidence to the committee in private for many years and that is where the real detail will be discussed. But the decision was taken recently that this was no longer sufficient. Thirty years ago, the intelligence agencies existed almost entirely in the dark. There was no legal footing for them and no form of accountability - other than ministerial sign-off - until 1994. The names of the heads of the organisations would not even have been widely known. The spies began to speak in public in the 1990s in carefully controlled settings but this hearing marks a significant milestone. Modern concerns such as terrorism and cyber-security are inherently more public-facing than the kind of monitoring of the Soviet Union that occupied so much time in the Cold War. Public notions of transparency also mean the days of staying out of the limelight have gone. American spy chiefs do appear before Congress publicly but the hearings can be pretty anodyne. When the British committee watched some recordings of their US counterparts some of them had second thoughts about going public - they feared the snooze factor might be too much. So a key question will be how far the members of the ISC want to go in challenging the spy chiefs and giving them a hard time. That is important because it is not just the spy chiefs who people will be watching closely. The committee itself is also under scrutiny and this performance will be crucial in defining whether it really is capable of holding the intelligence agencies to account. Its performance in the decade after 9/11 has been criticised. A number of key controversies have swept through Britain's intelligence community - Iraq's absent weapons of mass destruction, whether the 7 July 2005 London bombings could have been prevented, and the UK's involvement in the rendition and transfer of detainees, to take the three most high-profile. But in each of these areas, the ISC has underperformed. The details about Iraq came out thanks to the Butler Inquiry and now the Chilcot Inquiry - not the ISC's own report. On 7/7, the committee had to go back and re-report after gaps in its initial findings. And, on rendition, the record is also decidedly patchy. The ISC's initial conclusions were challenged by evidence about British resident Binyam Mohamed who spent four years at Guantanamo Bay. Its findings was also called into question more recently over MI6's involvement with the transfer of two men to Libya - evidence which emerged thanks to the collapse of the Gaddafi regime rather than the oversight of the committee. The Snowden affair has raised new questions - including about whether the committee was too quick to defend spies rather than oversee them. The past problems were acknowledged by the committee's chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, when he took over in 2010 and a number of reforms were introduced under the Justice and Security Act. The ISC can now demand information rather than request it and its remit has been extended formally to cover operations rather than just the management of the agencies. The committee's investigators can go into the agencies and look for material rather than take what they are given - something they have already done. Parliament - rather than No 10 - is also being given more power over the composition of the committee itself. Finally, we have the public hearing itself - the most visible sign that, in the spy world, times have changed. </body>

      <description>The politics of ending shipbuilding at Portsmouth</description>

      <body>Take many hundreds of job losses, add the fact they're in a strategic industry, stir in the end of more than half a millennium of shipbuilding history and top it all up with the raw politics of Scottish independence. What you have got is a very potent brew. Two key questions are likely to dominate the political reaction to the news that shipbuilding is to end at Portsmouth: 1. Have English shipyard workers paid the price for keeping jobs in Glasgow? First things first: why are the job losses happening at all? Cuts were always inevitable after the completion of two massive aircraft carriers - a once in 30 or 40 year event. Even the placing of orders for 13 new frigates was never going to replace the lost work. What's more, cuts to the defence budget mean that there's a gap between the end of work on the carriers and the start of work on Type 26 Global Combat Ships. Government and industry insiders insist that the choice of Govan over Portsmouth was a decision first considered over three years ago - long before Alex Salmond was even re-elected as First Minister of Scotland in 2011 let alone the announcement of a referendum date. It was discussed as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review carried out as soon as the coalition came to power in 2010. A senior defence industry figure has told my BBC colleague John Moylan that BAE Systems recommended to government that shipbuilding at Portsmouth should end as long as two years ago. He said: "This is not about Scotland and independence - closing shipbuilding at Portsmouth is the sensible strategic decision for the long term." I'm told that Govan has two advantages over Portsmouth - a lower cost base and a partnership with the Scotstoun shipyard on the other side of the Clyde. Tory strategists point out that it's hardly in their political interests to save a Scottish shipyard and part close an English one. Nevertheless, it's clear that there can be no decision on something as significant as the building of warships without a great deal of political calculation. As I reported yesterday, one well-placed source told me that the government was "acutely conscious of the politics of the Clyde" and did not want to give Alex Salmond a gift a little less than a year ahead of the independence referendum. 2. If Scotland votes next year to become an independent nation will "rump UK" (or whatever what is left will be called) have to depend on a foreign country to build its warships? Not necessarily. Shipbuilding will not end immediately at Portsmouth. Even when it does some of those employed in the city by BAE Systems will continue working on ship repair and maintenance. Work on the new frigates will begin long after the Scottish referendum vote. It will be interesting to examine the deal the government does with BAE to see whether it includes a "get out" clause allowing work on the frigates to be transferred from Glasgow to Portsmouth if Scotland votes for independence. Govan's local Labour MP Ian Davidson wants just such a clause as part of his campaign to persuade people to vote No in the referendum. One of those who has been consulted about this decision told me that if Scotland votes No it would still be possible to switch work to England. </body>

      <description>Do MPs agree with Russell Brand and Jeremy Paxman?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24832816</url>

      <body>BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman has condemned the "green-bench pantomime in Westminster" and comedian Russell Brand has criticised "the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". BBC Radio 4's PM programme asked three MPs for their views on voter apathy. Like it or not, most people's lives are run by political decisions and those political decisions are made by politicians that you elect. The trouble is that not enough people bother to go out and elect us. There's a cynicism; we don't help ourselves. Interestingly, last night I was at a dinner and an MP got up and the first thing she said was: "Before I was an MP I had a proper job." She was a youth worker. We're actually quite self-deprecating and that plays into the hands of cynical people, of which I would count Jeremy Paxman, who have this caricature of politicians as a bunch of duplicitous so-and-sos on some big gravy train, living the life of Riley. Actually being an MP is a job, it's an exceptional job, and most of us spend an awful lot of time, blood, sweat and tears, putting a lot of effort into it. I don't mind people attacking my political policies, and they can say I've got it absolutely wrong over certain things I've been doing in my constituency, or in Westminster - but this constant attack that actually all MPs are duplicitous, and we're just on this gravy train and we're good for nothing, and it's all a pantomime is deeply undermining of the democratic process, and can only switch people off from bothering to vote, particularly young people. That's why barely 40% of young people at the last election who were able to vote for the first time - 18 to 24-year-olds - actually bothered to vote, and that really is worrying for the future. [Russell Brand is] deeply destructive, actually. Watching that interview with Jeremy Paxman he's very amusing, very articulate, but it's deeply destructive, the influence on young people who think, "Gosh, Russell said we shouldn't bother to vote, let's not vote". The way not to get [turnout] to improve is to say, it's all a waste of time and to go on the champagne anarchist ego trip that Russell Brand is on. That really doesn't help. I did some work at the beginning of the century, in 2001, when the turnout in my constituency was particularly low. What I found was that people weren't apathetic about voting, they were angry. It was anger not apathy that motivated them. The problem really is that we tend to set our agenda from the Westminster bubble, so what concerns us here in Westminster.... we really don't listen, and we really don't connect to people in the community enough. So I've completely changed the way I do my politics from that experience. Now the first thing I do is listen, and people's politics really starts from the local, they care about what's happening in their home, and in their local community. Quite often I can't address the national issues that worry them: I couldn't address the issues about immigration in Barking before the last election, or the lack of social housing. But I could address the issues about the post boxes, where they were sited, or whether the rubbish was collected, or whether we had prostitution on the street corner. When I started addressing those issues that really concerned them, I connected with local people, I started to build trust, and I then got people voting again and voting for me, and seeing off [2010 BNP general election candidate for Barking] Nick Griffin. Whilst Russell Brand may be right to be fed up, the answer is not revolution. There are no great divides in principle between the three parties. By and large we're all in favour of the mixed economy, we're all by and large - with some exceptions - in favour of state education, the kind of things which were battles between different parties have disappeared. In addition to that, politics has become a question of management: can you manage the economy better than I can? The third thing, rather paradoxically, is that the information technology revolution has meant that the age of deference has been swept aside, and I'm in no doubt whatsoever that there were people in the House of Commons 20, 30, 40 years ago who were a lot less than the perfect MP, but of course in those days no-one knew. On the whole question of executive pay: 50 years ago, my mother wouldn't have had the slightest idea what the director general of the BBC was paid, and she wouldn't have thought it was her business, but now because information is better available people are better informed and inevitably people are less charitable. [Russell Brand showed] a real lack of self-awareness: everything's wrong, but absolutely no suggestions as to how it would be put right. If Russell Brand were the prime minister, imagine what kind of country it would be - if you possibly can.

      <title>Can UK economy stay top of the league?</title>
      <description>Is the UK economic recovery like Arsenal's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24833200</url>
      <date>1383732051</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70939000/jpg/_70939150_robertpeston.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Why is the British economy like my favourite football team, Arsenal FC? We're both top of the league - by a margin (blimey, it's been a few years since I said that). If the latest Markit survey of business activity and orders is accurate, the British economy is growing at a remarkably rapid 1.3% in the last three months of the year - which would be faster than any other rich developed economy. The UK is growing significantly faster than Germany and the US, for example - and probably faster than Japan, which in my strained analogy is Liverpool FC, whose under-performance has endured even longer than Arsenal's. If that estimated British growth rate is accurate and sustained, UK GDP in 2013 will rise over 3% - which is significantly faster than any mainstream economist is currently predicting and would be a return to growth rates we haven't enjoyed since the financial and economic crash of 2007-8. So the question about the British economy is the same as the question about Arsenal. Is the current success built on solid foundations - it it sustainable? Probably the first thing to say, if you're an Arsenal supporter or a British citizen, is that any recovery will do, after six bleak years (longer for the Gooners). But the worry would be that the economy and Arsenal are a bit thin in defence and attack. What do I mean? Well, after the election, the hope of the government was that this would be a recovery different from all others in modern times, one led by exports and business investment, in order to reduce the UK's economic dependence on debt-fuelled consumer spending and economic activity linked to a booming housing market. To use the ghastly jargon, the economy would be rebalanced, so that we would gradually reduce the deficit between what we buy from the rest of the world v what we buy abroad - a deficit that has put the debts of the UK on a rising trajectory for 30 years. It was a bit like the hope of Arsenal that it could win the Premier League without spending record sums on world-class players, or paying those inflated wages of more than £100,000 a week. Well, business investment plummeted in 2008 and has never properly recovered. And the gap between exports and imports has remained stubbornly wide. In fact in the first three months of the year, the UK's deficit with the rest of the world was a shocking 5.5% of GDP, before narrowing to a still too-wide 3.2% in the second quarter. The result has been a failure by the UK to restore economic output back to where it was in early 2008, which has contributed to a painful and persistent squeeze in living standards. And there has been an analogous absence of any trophies in the Emirates' cabinet, as a consequence of a policy decision not to splash the cash on superstars. But 2013 has been a year of modest ideological shift (should we say U-turn?) by Wenger and Osborne. Arsenal's Wenger relented and forked out £42m for the balletic and brilliant Ozil, and has allegedly smashed through the wage hierarchy at the club in the process. And the British chancellor belatedly concluded that it was highly unlikely that the UK economy would gain what economists call "lift-off momentum" without the traditional boost to the morale of British consumers from a reviving housing market. So George Osborne launched versions one and two of the Help to Buy scheme, which provides many billions of pounds of taxpayer loans and guarantees for house construction and house purchases. Here is the thing. Respective revivals based solely on a few star midfield players or on debt-fuelled consumption would end in tears. So can the recoveries be underpinned - in the case of the economy, by businesses belatedly starting to invest and getting better at selling to the rest of the world; and at Arsenal, by reinforcement of defence and attack in the January transfer window? And here the football analogy implodes. Arsenal can afford to invest in new players having been prudent in the way it has managed its finances in boom years and lean years. By contrast, the UK economy is still shouldering record and rising debts, equivalent to more than five times the value of economic output (based on aggregating household, business, financial and government debts). Which means that the British economic recovery could be self-immolating in a way that I don't think could to happen to Arsenal. What do I mean? If the Bank of England became concerned that the speed of growth was becoming inflationary, it could push up interest rates much faster than is currently implied by its so-called "forward guidance" on this. And with household liabilities still equivalent to some 140% of household resources, and with an estimated five million households shouldering excessive debts, sharp rises in interest rates would cause profound misery. That misery would not be confined simply to people. It would also infect our banks (again), which would suffer significant losses as borrowers discovered that they could not afford to pay interest rates above today's abnormally low rates. So if you think there's pressure being Osborne or Wenger, it is probably as nothing compared with the burden on the Canuck governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. If he and his colleagues raise interest rates too soon and too much, there's a risk the recovery will be suffocated at birth, or worse. Were he to raise them too late, there is a danger that the financial precariousness of households and banks would actually be worsened, as they ship in more debt - and the anti-inflation credentials of the Bank would be undermined, perhaps fatally. Now what would Alex Ferguson have done? </body>

      <title>Time for MPs to snuff it out?</title>
      <description>Why is snuff still available to MPs free of charge?</description>

      <body>It is said to offer a performance-enhancing pick-me-up for crucial Commons tests of mettle... or chemical consolation for those found wanting. But do MPs still need their supply of snuff? Under a tradition sparked when smoking was banned in the chamber in the late 17th century, snuff, or powdered tobacco, is distributed on demand and free of charge to MPs. Few partake nowadays, and for Green MP Caroline Lucas it has become an emblem of how Parliament remains tethered to a bygone era. "As I walked into the chamber today, I noticed the snuff box still provided for MPs by the entrance," Ms Lucas reported in 2012, during a debate on reforming Commons working hours. "I hope that members will take this opportunity to bring the Commons out of the snuff age and into the 21st century," she said. The sight of the snuff box - fashioned from wood reclaimed from the old Commons chamber, which was destroyed in World War II, and decorated with a silver plaque - piqued another MP's curiosity, and he tabled a written question in Parliament on the topic. Conservative MP for Gillingham and Rainham Rehman Chishti called on the House authorities to disclose how much snuff had been distributed to his colleagues in the past decade, and at what cost. "It is unusual for members to request snuff, and there are no regular users of this facility. No records of usage or cost are maintained," came the response. "Recent practice has been for this tradition to be maintained at the principal doorkeeper's personal expense." Mr Chishti told the BBC: "Parliament is full of these quirky and anachronistic rituals and procedures. "The last time this question was asked it was found that in 1989, 1.5 oz of snuff was being consumed at the cost of 99p. "The answer to my recent question appears to show that no one's really using it, it's not paid for by the taxpayer and it's therefore not currently costing very much money." Robin Fell, the current occupant of the principal doorkeeper post, described his snuff-distribution duties as a "great privilege" in a recent interview with BBC Parliament's Sam Francis - despite the apparent paucity of dabblers. "It may come as a surprise to some people, as it does to some MPs, that I pay for the snuff," he said. "A member may perhaps feel the need for a mild stimulant before he enters the chamber, or perhaps when he's leaving the chamber if he's had an unfortunate experience in there. "But it's not a serious drain on my emoluments, because when I took over the job, my predecessor left me with a nice supply of snuff and I haven't had to replenish it yet. "In due course, I suspect, perhaps next year, I might have to tootle off to a snuff shop, and purchase some." Martin Dockrell, the director of policy and research at public health charity Ash, commented: "It seems a shame for the poor doorkeeper who has to shell out from his own pocket for MPs' snuff. "But this tradition is a useful reminder of just how far things have changed. It used to be the sign of a good host to offer visitors tobacco and now it is the sign of a good guest not to smoke indoors - at least not without asking. "It is, of course illegal to give free samples of tobacco products so organisations should be wary of following Parliament's example, unless they share the immunity of a royal palace." There appears to be scant data on the health risks for non-smokers using nasal snuff, although an increased risk of cancer has recently been observed in smokers and ex-smokers who take the powder. Public Health England notes that similar products, such as chewing tobacco, are "known to be carcinogenic", and advises "strongly against use of tobacco in any of its formulations, including snuff". But Ms Lucas concluded that the Commons snuff supply was "perhaps just a faintly amusing anachronism, which falls into the category... of traditional things that are not harmful". The principal doorkeeper puts it pithily: "If members want a pinch of snuff, why shouldn't they have a pinch of snuff?" </body>

      <title>Europe: The fight for UK hearts and minds</title>
      <description>Big business joins battle for UK role in Europe</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24801895</url>

      <body>It used to be said, perhaps first by Calvin Coolidge, that: "What's good for business is good for America." In the UK the main business lobbying organisation the CBI has joined the debate about Britain's future in Europe. Its argument can be summed up as: "What's good for business is good for Britain." A lengthy study, according to the CBI's director general John Cridland, came "to the unequivocal conclusion that British business, large and small, wants to remain within a reformed EU". The CBI has produced an array of statistics concluding that membership of the EU is worth an extra 4-5% of GDP which translates into £78bn a year for the economy. That is presented as the equivalent of £1,225 per individual or £3,000 per household. The CBI wants to define the choice for the British people as "in with reform" or "out with no influence". It is a position supported by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and by David Cameron who told the CBI's annual conference that he could secure a "yes" vote in a promised referendum. The kind of reforms the CBI would be looking for would include less red tape, removing barriers to e-commerce, and ring-fencing national employment law from EU directives. Despite the CBI's enthusiasm for staying in the EU it does register unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. The CBI's intervention in this debate follows a drum-beat of statements from the business community; the first salvos in a three-year campaign to get the British people to vote "yes" to Europe. So we have had Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of financial services industry body TheCityUK saying: "I do not believe the City's pre-eminent position will survive if we lose our role as Europe's financial capital." We have had a report entitled Manufacturing: Our future in Europe which concluded that 85% of UK manufacturing firms support EU membership. Other indicators have been more cautious. There was a YouGov survey, published by the campaign group Business for Britain, which reported that - by a majority of 46% to 37% - company bosses believed that the costs of complying with the single market outweighed the benefits of staying in the EU. In October, the think tank Open Europe estimated that the top 100 EU laws cost the UK economy £27.4bn a year. So the battleground is being marked out. It is much less about a fundamental re-negotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. It is more about reforming the EU. It is the road that the rest of Europe is trying to channel the British debate down. Numerous EU leaders have made it clear that Britain will not be able to cherry pick what it likes or dislikes. There will be no tolerance of further British exceptionalism. Senior German officials have been loud and clear; they are open to reforms if they are for all 28 EU members. So David Cameron's emphasis, in recent times, has been on making the EU work better. He tried to make the recent summit about cutting red tape. He came armed with a little booklet explaining how "sweeping away barriers to growth" would "benefit all of Europe". The Commission has eagerly supported some of this agenda. They have said that 74% of Europeans believe the EU generates too much red tape. President Barroso has said the EU should be "big on big things and smaller on small things". In Brussels it is said that there was "blood on the wall" when some regulations were withdrawn by the Commission. There is a message here. The Commission is saying there is flexibility over reviewing legislation on a case-by-case basis to gauge its impact on competitiveness but the door is closed to a fundamental re-negotiation about the competences of the EU. Speaking at the CBI conference, David Cameron said: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It is a long-term strategic choice for Britain: let us reform this organisation. Let us make changes to how it works, and then let's put those changes to the British people in a referendum." He was clear that EU membership is "overwhelmingly in Britain's economic interests". So as the argument about Britain's future in Europe develops it appears less about the repatriation of powers or challenging the commitment to "ever closer union" but more about making the EU work more efficiently, with the prime minister being urged to go out and build an alliance for reform. The question is whether this kind of "reformed" EU will be enough to convince the British public, whose support for EU membership was described again by the prime minister as "wafer thin". </body>

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <title>Autism detectable 'in first months'</title>
      <description>Signs of autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, early research suggests. US researchers analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism had shown diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - in the first few months of life. The findings, reported in Nature, raised hope for early interventions to tackle autism, said a UK expert. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the disease, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

      <title>Prosthetic bladder 'controls urine'</title>
      <description>A device that could one day restore bladder function to patients with a severed spinal cord has been devised by UK researchers.</description>

      <body>A device that could one day restore bladder function to patients with a severed spinal cord has been devised by UK researchers and tested in animals. Nerve damage can leave no sense of when the bladder is full or control over when the contents are released. A study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed a device to read the remaining nerves' signals could be used to control the organ. The charity Spinal Research said this was "impressive and important" work. The loss of bladder, bowel and sexual function after spinal cord injury is often rated by patients as having the biggest impact on quality of life. When the spinal cord is injured, signals passing up from the bladder cannot tell the brain when the bladder is full. Going the other way, signals from the brain cannot tell the bladder when it is time to go to the toilet. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have devised a solution that uses the nerves still around the bladder. Electrodes wrapped around bundles of nerves can interpret signals that say the bladder is full. Stimulating other sets of nerves can get the bladder to contract on demand and prevent it emptying of its own volition. One of the researchers, Dr Daniel Chew, told the BBC the device had worked on rats. "It is very effective. The feasibility studies are done, we're now limited by miniaturisation of the technology," he said. While the components that fit inside a rat could be converted for human use, the rest of the technology to process the information recorded currently needs a 6ft (2m) stack of equipment. This needs to shrunk down to a handheld device that can inform a patient when the bladder is full and a trigger button to contract the bladder. Dr Chew added: "This device is not the ultimate goal, the ultimate aim is to regenerate the spinal cord. What we're doing is restoring some function, not curing spinal cord injury." Dr Mark Bacon, the director of research at the charity Spinal Research, told the BBC: "Bladder dysfunction blights the life of many with spinal cord injuries and has a very major impact on their health and quality of life. "This is impressive and important work addressing one of the major limitations found with existing options for electrical stimulation to control bladder emptying, namely the need to surgically destroy the sensory fibres coming from the bladder. "Sparing and making use of sensory signals from a filling bladder adds a welcome degree of sophistication to elective voiding whilst retaining other functions normally lost such as erectile function - a distressing consequence of current methods." </body>

      <title>Car deaths 'down 40% in 50 years'</title>

      <body>The annual figures for people dying in car crashes in England and Wales have fallen by 40% in the past 50 years. A paper in the Emergency Medicine Journal says this is despite the rise in the number of drivers on the road. Men were more likely die than women in each year studied. Safety experts said measures including seat belts, speed cameras and curbs on drink driving had all helped cut deaths. About 1.3 million people die globally in crashes every year. Current trends suggest road accidents are expected to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. In this study, a team from the University of Nottingham looked at data on road deaths from the Office of National Statistics from 1960 to 2009. During that period, 102,196 people died as a direct result of a road traffic accident. In 1960, car crashes caused 1,647 deaths, but by 2009 the figure had fallen to 964 - a drop of 41%. Over that time, car ownership across the UK increased by about 3% every year. Men were more likely to die than women in every year studied. And those who from socially deprived backgrounds were consistently more likely to die in a car crash than those who were more affluent. There was a 70% fall in deaths among infants and children, from 66 in 1960 to 20 in 2009. Fatalities among the over-75s did rise - from 68 to 109 - but the researchers say this should be seen in the context of the increase in the number of drivers in this age group. Writing in the journal the researchers, led by Dr Andrew Fogarty, said factors such as the introduction of compulsory seat belts, drink driving curbs, child safety seats, and speed cameras, as well as the development of specialist trauma centres, had all helped to cut deaths. They added: "However, it is possible that while these interventions have resulted in a reduction in the absolute number of deaths from [road traffic accidents] in England and Wales, they have not modified the relative differential in age of death between sexes or socioeconomic groups in those who die after [a car crash]." Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: "The reductions in road deaths over the last five years or so have been particularly substantial, although this is partly due to the effects the economic downturn and periods of unusually poor weather on the level of driving. "However, as the BMJ report identifies, not everyone has benefited equally from these improvements in road safety, and people from less well off backgrounds suffer a disproportionate share of the risk. "The social factors that create this increased risk need to be tackled in a systematic way by organisations responsible for road safety. "Common approaches to improving the health, wellbeing and the safety of individuals and communities need to be identified, and closer ties and partnership working between road safety and health professionals should be developed at all levels of work." He added: "We also need to focus on specific groups of road users who face higher risks, especially cyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists and young, novice drivers." </body>

      <title>Hospital 'dismissed bullying claims'</title>
      <description>Concerns about a "bullying culture" at a hospital under police investigation were raised more than a year ago.</description>

      <body>Concerns about a "bullying culture" at a hospital now under police investigation were raised more than a year ago, it is claimed. The Care Quality Commission has found "inaccuracies" in the cancer waiting time data at Colchester Hospital. The Royal College of Nursing says the hospital dismissed its concerns raised more than a year ago as "fantasy". The hospital said an investigation carried out by its own management in February 2012 was "not adequate". Staff told inspectors they were "pressured or bullied" to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said. The inspector said patients' lives may have been put at risk. Essex Police has been sent information by the CQC and is currently investigating whether there are grounds for a formal criminal investigation. Karen Webb, the regional director for the eastern region at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said she raised concerns a year ago about the "bullying culture, the secrecy of the management culture" at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust. She said RCN members who voiced these concerns were dismissed as "fantasists" and the board of the hospital tried to bully them into "shutting up". "I think there are a few things that smell rather unpleasant about Colchester General and the way that it is being led," Ms Webb said. "It is a great shame the trust chose not to listen to us over a year ago. Not only has it not acted on it, it behaved in the way that bullies classically behave. "Regularly, staff at Colchester Hospital have been told to keep quiet, to shut up, to not say anything about the directions that they've been given by senior managers to make sure that the hospital meets its target by massaging the data." Responding to her claims, Dr Gordon Coutts, the hospital's chief executive since July 2010, said there had been an investigation into the allegations in 2012 carried out by two members of the management team. This probe, he said, "was not adequate" and "did not go deep enough". Asked by BBC Essex if he would resign, Dr Coutts said: "My job is to keep improving this hospital, and I intend to continue to do so." Tim Roberts, the regional co-ordinator of Unison, said it first raised concerns last year. "Our members said they were being bullied, they were under undue pressure by middle and senior managers to falsify records, to put erroneous data on the cancer pathway database," he said. "The dates when a patient was referred to hospital - they were asked to change the dates. "The result was the trust would look like it kept to the cancer pathway deadline set by the Department of Health. "There's a high likelihood patients received treatment later because the wrong date was put on the database." Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell said he was "appalled" at the findings that showed staff falsified patient data. Sir Bob said what has happened "cannot be justified under any circumstances". "What level was this knowledge known? Senior people will have to answer for what they knew," said Sir Bob. "The consequences may well be that some people in senior positions may go or be asked to go." NHS England said it would now lead an incident management team of cancer specialists, to ensure the safety of cancer patients at the hospital. There will also be a review looking back to as far as 2010 to check whether any other patients had their notes changed or "inappropriately recorded". Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, recommended Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust be put into special measures, which could lead to a new management team being installed or another trust put in charge. The hospital has set up a helpline for any patients or families who have concerns - 0800 028 2026. </body>

      <title>NHS deal on branded-medicine cost</title>
      <description>The government and pharmaceutical companies agree a five-year-deal to fix NHS spending on branded medicines.</description>

      <body>The government and pharmaceutical companies have agreed a five-year-deal to fix NHS spending on branded medicines across the UK. Last year, the NHS spent more than £12bn on branded drugs. Under the deal, NHS spending will remain flat for two years, followed by increases of less than 2% in the following three years. But the industry, which will absorb any costs above that limit, said it was a "tough deal" built on "myth". The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) is a voluntary scheme usually re-negotiated every five years This scheme applies to all licensed prescription medicines to which the manufacturer has applied a brand name. There had previously been an agreed price cut on the branded medicines sold to the NHS, but there was no limit on the overall cost. Typical annual growth in NHS spending has been about 5%. The new arrangements will be introduced from January 1 2014. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "This agreement ensures NHS patients will receive the best and most advanced medicines in the world while managing the cost." But Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: "Whilst the deal allows us to move forward and focus on the key issue of ensuring NHS patients get access to the medicines they need, the government needs to recognise that medicines are an investment in patient care and not just a cost to be managed." ABPI president Deepak Khana added: "It should not be underestimated how tough this deal is for the industry. "The negotiations were built on a myth that medicines are expensive in the UK, which is not true. "The UK already spends amongst the lowest on medicines as a percentage of [gross domestic product] and has some of the lowest prices in Europe, yet UK patients still do not always get access to the most innovative medicines." </body>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has dismissed Labour leader Ed Miliband's claim that NHS accident and emergency services in England are in "crisis". AandE targets had been "missed for 15 consecutive weeks", Mr Miliband said. The opposition leader accused Mr Cameron of breaking his pledge that "I refuse to go back to the days when people wait for hours in AandE." But Mr Cameron said waiting times in England had fallen and criticised Labour's handling of the NHS in Wales. At the prime minister's weekly Commons question session, Mr Miliband asked whether there would be a "crisis" in the NHS this winter. Having received his response, the Labour MP commented: "The whole country will have heard that the prime minister can't guarantee that there won't be a crisis this winter in our AandE departments. "That's because there already is a crisis. "That's what the president of the Royal College says," Mr Miliband continued, "he says this, 'There are almost daily instances in most AandE departments of patients facing extended trolley waits.' "The prime minister said two years ago, 'I refuse to go back to the days when people wait for hours in AandE.' "He's broken that promise, hasn't he?" The Mr Cameron was "complacent about the AandE crisis and clueless about what is actually happening in the NHS", Mr Milband added. "What the British people know is the NHS is heading into winter with fewer nurses, a lack of senior AandE doctors and a shortage of beds. "He promised he would protect the NHS but it's now clear the NHS isn't safe in his hands." But Mr Cameron said: "AandE in this country is treating 1.2 million more patients now than under Labour and let me give him one simple fact - today in our AandEs the average waiting time is 50 minutes. "When the shadow health secretary was sitting here as health secretary the average waiting time was over 70 minutes." He added: "There are more AandE consultants working in AandE than there were five years ago. "That is why we're meeting our targets in England and that is why Labour is missing its targets in Wales."

      <body>Depression is the second most common cause of disability worldwide after back pain, according to a review of research. The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other diseases and injuries as a cause of disability. Globally, only a small proportion of patients have access to treatment, the World Health Organization says. Depression was ranked at number two as a global cause of disability, but its impact varied in different countries and regions. For example, rates of major depression were highest in Afghanistan and lowest in Japan. In the UK, depression was ranked at number three in terms of years lived with a disability. Dr Alize Ferrari from the University of Queensland's School of Population Health led the study. "Depression is a big problem and we definitely need to pay more attention to it than we are now," she told BBC News. "There's still more work to be done in terms of awareness of the disease and also in coming up with successful ways of treating it. "The burden is different between countries, so it tends to be higher in low and middle income countries and lower in high income countries." Policy-makers had made an effort to bring depression to the forefront, but there was a lot more work to be done, she added. "There's lots of stigma we know associated with mental health," she explained. "What one person recognises as disabling might be different to another person and might be different across countries as well, there are lots of cultural implications and interpretations that come in place, which makes it all the more important to raise awareness of the size of the problem and also signs and how to detect it." The data - for the year 2010 - follows similar studies in 1990 and 2000 looking at the global burden of depression. Commenting on the study, Dr Daniel Chisholm, a health economist at the department for mental health and substance abuse at the World Health Organization said depression was a very disabling condition. "It's a big public health challenge and a big problem to be reckoned with but not enough is being done. "Around the world only a tiny proportion of people get any sort of treatment or diagnosis." The WHO recently launched a global mental health action plan to raise awareness among policy-makers. </body>

      <title>IVF success affected by ethnicity</title>
      <description>Asian and black women who have IVF are less likely to become pregnant than white women using the same fertility treatment, UK research reveals.</description>

      <body>Asian and black women who have IVF are less likely to become pregnant than white women using similar fertility treatment, UK research suggests. The Nottingham University team say they are unsure why this is, but say it could be down to genetics as well as social and environmental factors. They looked at IVF success rates for 1,517 women treated in their clinic. Live birth rates for ethnic minority women were significantly lower, the study published in BJOG found. Overall, 35% of ethnic minority women successfully conceived and gave birth after IVF compared with 44% of white women treated at the clinic between 2006 and 2011. This was despite all the women appearing to have favourable chances of having a baby, based on factors such as the quality of their egg reserves. The birth rate also differed between three ethnic sub-groups - 21.4% for Middle East Asian women, 23.3% for African-Caribbean women and 38% for South East Asian women - although this finding was not statistically significant. Lead researcher Dr Walid Maalouf said the reasons behind the findings were unclear. "Further research into genetic background as a potential determinant of IVF outcome, as well as the influencing effects of lifestyle and cultural factors on reproductive outcomes is needed," he said. The researchers say their findings could be used to help counsel couples about their realistic probabilities of success with IVF. Women from ethnic backgrounds might be encouraged to seek treatment earlier to improve their odds of having a baby, for example, said John Thorp, BJOG deputy editor in chief. The outgoing head of the UK's fertility watchdog has also called for greater clarity over the relative pros and cons of IVF. Prof Lisa Jardine said success rates were "discouragingly low" and that those providing the treatment "traded in hope". Two thirds of couples will not conceive after a cycle of IVF. </body>

      <title>Music lessons 'sculpt the brain'</title>
      <description>Learning a musical instrument as a child confers brain gains that last long into adult life, according to a small study.</description>

      <body>Learning a musical instrument as a child gives the brain a boost that lasts long into adult life, say scientists. Adults who used to play an instrument, even if they have not done so in decades, have a faster brain response to speech sounds, research suggests. The more years of practice during childhood, the faster the brain response was, the small study found. The Journal of Neuroscience work looked at 44 people in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The volunteers in the study listened to a synthesised speech syllable, "da", while researchers measured electrical activity in the region of the brain that processes sound information - the auditory brainstem. Despite none of the study participants having played an instrument in nearly 40 years, those who completed between four and 14 years of music training early in life had a faster response to the speech sound than those who had never been taught music. The study took place at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University in Illinois, US. As people grow older, they often experience changes in the brain that compromise hearing. For instance, the brains of older adults show a slower response to fast-changing sounds, which is important for interpreting speech. It could be that learning an instrument in childhood causes a fixed change in the brain that is retained throughout life. Or, music classes somehow prepare the brain for future auditory learning, say the researchers. Past work by the same team found younger adults were better listeners if they had been taught an instrument as a child. Experts also believe musical training - with an emphasis on rhythmic skills - can exercise the auditory-system. But these studies are all relatively small and cannot ascertain if it is definitely musical training that is causing the effect. Arguably, children offered the opportunity to learn an instrument, which can be expensive, may come from more privileged backgrounds and this may have an influence. Commenting on the study, Michael Kilgard from the University of Texas, who was not involved with the research, said: "Being a millisecond faster may not seem like much, but the brain is very sensitive to timing and a millisecond compounded over millions of neurons can make a real difference in the lives of older adults." </body>

      <title>Prostate cancer test 'may save ops'</title>
      <description>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest.</description>

      <body>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest. Early data, presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference, suggests a genetic test can tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours. A big challenge in treating the cancer is knowing whether surgery to remove the gland is needed. Cancer charities said a successful test would be a "game-changer". Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK. There are more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed and 10,000 deaths each year. The decision to remove the prostate is based on an examination of a tumour sample under the microscope. However, the procedure has significant side-effects such as infertility, difficulty maintaining and keeping an erection and uncontrolled urinating. One of the researchers, Prof Dan Berney, from Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC: "We need a better test as we are over-treating many men; most will die with, not of, prostate cancer. "We need to discriminate between the aggressive forms and those that will grumble along and just need monitoring." The commercial test, developed by Myriad Genetics but independently assessed by Queen Mary University of London, looks at the activity level of genes inside a sample of the tumour. If 31 genes involved in controlling how cells divide are highly active, it indicates the cancer is aggressive. Prof Berney said such information could "substantially change" decisions made by doctors and patients but the costs were "huge" and it was certainly not going to be offered on the NHS in the next few years. "We need to validate it and we're not there yet, but it is the strongest test we've had so far," he added. Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: "Developing an effective test to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer could be a game-changer for those affected by the condition. "We urgently need to reach a point where we can focus resources on saving more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year, whilst sparing the many others who needn't have concerns. "The results of this study are certainly intriguing, and take us a step closer to the diagnostic process for prostate cancer that men deserve. We will watch with great interest developments in this area." Dr Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: "Being able to tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours would help us take a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment. "Understanding more about the nature of a patient's tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side-effects, whilst also meaning that those who do need treatment receive it rapidly." </body>

      <body>TV chef Jamie Oliver has been honoured by GPs for his work in tackling childhood obesity. The Royal College of General Practitioners praised the 38-year-old who can now use the letters FRCGP (Hon) after his name. Oliver, who started his own campaign to make school dinners healthier, said he was "humbled" to receive the award. The chef, who already has an MBE, also championed a movement to get more people cooking wholesome meals. There are now seven Ministry of Food centres around Britain where people can learn how to make nutritious meals on a budget and are encouraged to pass on the skills. RCGP chairwoman Clare Gerada said the star was deserving of his award - the highest honour the college can bestow. Accepting the award, Oliver said doctors could help tackle the long-term, obesity-related issues which might not be resolved by politicians during their short electoral terms. "Governments, as wonderful or awful as they might individually be in their randomly changing roles, they are like ships that pass in the night," he said. "Sometimes if they get great they often move on and someone on their maiden voyage has to learn and pick it up from scratch again. "So actually GPs, chefs, the people that work in public health - they're the people that spend decades doing it. Hopefully between us all we can make a difference. "To make real change you need to be able to think 10 to 15 years in advance, not three. "I'm not a political expert but all I would say is that change requires that long-termism. When it comes to things like school food and school food education I don't think it should be political, it should be standard." Oliver grew up surrounded by good food: his parents ran the Cricketers pub in Essex and, from the age of eight, he started cooking and helping the chefs there, and learning to appreciate quality ingredients along the way. After an undistinguished school career, he decided he wanted to cook for a living and studied catering at Westminster Kingsway College in London. During his apprenticeship, Oliver worked with some of the best chefs in London. He then moved into TV, hosting the first of many cookery shows - The Naked Chef. </body>

      <body>Three carers mocked, bullied and assaulted elderly residents of a care home, a court has heard. The three female staff members deny abusing eight people with advanced dementia at Hillcroft nursing home in Slyne-with-Hest near Lancaster. One resident was slapped and others were mocked "for entertainment" between May 2010 and September 2011, Preston Crown Court was told. A fourth carer has pleaded guilty to ill-treating residents, the jury heard. Darren Smith, 34, of Howgill Avenue, Lancaster, was seen in bed with a distressed resident and has admitted abusing eight people at the home, the court heard. Katie Cairns, 26, of Riverview Court, Westgate, Morecambe, is alleged to have abused four residents - stamping on the foot of one and mocking others by throwing bean bags at them and touching them. Carol Moore, 53, of Ripon Avenue, Beaumont, Lancaster, is accused of abusing six residents - slapping one and throwing bean bags at others while laughing. Gemma Pearson, 27, of Hill Street, Carnforth, is accused of tipping a resident out of their wheelchair. The defendants told other carers they were bored and were doing it for entertainment, prosecutors said. All were charged under the Mental Capacity Act 2005 with ill-treatment and wilful neglect of a person with lack of capacity. They had previously been suspended from the home following abuse allegations made by a receptionist and a cleaner in September 2011, the court heard. But they returned to work after being handed warnings following an internal investigation and the matter was not referred to the police or social services. The court heard in December 2011 the Care Quality Commission (CQC) was sent anonymous emails about the standard of care inside the home. The CQC referred the matter to the local authority's safeguarding team who told police in May 2012. The trial is expected to last up to four weeks. </body>

      <description>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests.</description>

      <body>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests. A study found more than two-thirds of men and around half of women in their early 40s were overweight or obese. However, the men were much less likely to realise they were carrying excess weight, say researchers at the University of London. The findings come from a study following 10,000 UK men and women born during one week in 1970. Those born in 1970 were considerably more likely to be overweight or obese in their early 40s than those born 12 years earlier, the researchers found. Men were far more likely than women to carry excess weight - with 45% classed as overweight and a further 23% obese compared with 29% and 20% of women. However, men were also much less likely than women to recognise they were overweight and attempt to slim down. Dr Alice Sullivan, of the Institute of Education at the University of London, told BBC News: "It's become so normalised for men to be overweight and they don't realise it - they're much less likely than women to realise their weight is unhealthy. "The worrying thing is that if men are overweight they are much less likely to take on health messages." Dr Sullivan and colleague Dr Matt Brown say carrying excess weight is seen as more socially acceptable for men than women. Overweight men are thus less likely to see this as a health problem and do something about it. Alerting men to their body mass index (BMI) status and the associated health risks should be a priority, they say. Commenting on the study, Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. "Worryingly, this research highlights that men seem more inclined to ignore their expanding waistlines than women. "Whether you're a man or a woman, maintaining a healthy, balanced diet and keeping physically active can help you reduce your weight and your risk of cardiovascular disease. "For advice and support on how to do this speak to your GP or practice nurse." The research studied the BMI of almost 10,000 men and women in their early 40s being followed by the 1970 British Cohort Study, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <body>Despite many households feeling the pinch with rising energy and food bills, research suggests that the average UK household throws out the equivalent of six meals a week. Buying too much, serving overly large portions and confusion over the shelf life of food are said to be the main reasons for discarding groceries. John Maguire reports. </body>

      <body>Colchester General Hospital in Essex has been reported to the police, after staff said they were being pressured to change data about waiting times for cancer patients. Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals in England, stated it was shocking that lives may have been put at risk, for the sake of waiting time figures. Speaking to the Today programme, Christina McAnea, Unison's national secretary for health, said: "We think there should be a police investigation into what happened here, and we think there needs to be a complete change to the way, particularly junior members of staff, are spoken to and are listened to. "This is about people across every grade within the hospital, having a responsibility to speak out when things go wrong," she added. Bernard Jenkin, MP for Harwich and North Essex and chair of the Public Administration Select Committee, said: "The whole point about the leadership in our public services is that it can't just be about targets." He explained: "We mustn't replace values with targets, targets are not values. Targets do not tell you what is the right thing to do."

      <body>School dinners have improved but there should be a drive to get more children eating them as the take-up remains stubbornly low, an association of school caterers says. Free schools and academies are currently exempt from the government's nutritional guidelines, but research found 92% of parents wanted to see the same standards applied to all schools. The chair of the Lead Association for Catering in Education said people still remember soggy cabbage and lumpy custard, but reckoned "there has been really good hard work" to improve the food, and that: "We are finally cooking on gas". Anne Bull said only 1% of packed lunches meet nutritional standards for school food, and that hot school meals were "by far the best option". Mrs Bull will be a guest on BBC2's Daily Politics where she will discuss the film at around 12:40 GMT.

      <body>Fears are growing about the sheer pressure of increasing patient numbers on the National Health Service, which could cause problems in accident and emergency departments this winter. Last week a National Audit Office (NAO) report said there were too many emergency admissions to hospitals in England, and the College of Emergency Medicine is warning a shortage of emergency doctors has the potential to put patients at risk. Speaking to the Today programme, Sir Bruce Keogh, NHS England's medical director, said: "I don't think we understand all the reasons why the winter made AandE busier than other seasons." He said: "One of the things we'll be considering in our strategy is that we need a better offer outside hospitals. "What we're really seeing is although this is manifest in AandE, this a problem with the whole system. Winter is going to be a particular issue," he added.

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly identified ligament may hold the key to common injuries</description>

      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used microscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the newly discerned ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and and role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <title>Colchester General: The key questions</title>
      <description>Key questions raised by patient record tampering at Colchester General</description>

      <body>Inspectors have found evidence of cancer records at an Essex hospital being tampered with, potentially putting patients at risk. A detailed report listing what was happening has been produced by the Care Quality Commission after inspectors went in at the end of August and start of September. The case has now been passed on to the police to investigate and the trust - Colchester General - faces being put into special measures and further investigations by the authorities in the NHS. In the weeks and months that come there are many questions that need to be answered. Inspectors looked at just over 60 cases and found the care of 22 may have been compromised. All but two of these case were chosen at random. That suggests this practice could have been pretty widespread. NHS England has set up a specialist team to look at the care given to patients since 2010. The hospital sees about 6,000 cancer patients a year, although the tampering with records seems so far to be centred around the specialities that deal with cancers such as kidney, bladder, prostate and colon. Senior management of the trust was alerted to what was happening early last year. An internal review was carried out by two members of the trust's executive team, but it did not result in the practice being stopped. The trust now concedes the investigation was not carried out properly- and has apologised for that. Colchester has yet to release details of that investigation or even said much about how it was carried out. But senior bosses - including the current chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts who has been in post since September 2010 - will have to explain themselves soon. The trust said a review of what went wrong with this investigation will be carried out. Colchester was one of 14 hospital trusts inspected as part of the Keogh Review into centres with high mortality rates. Eleven were subsequently put into special measures, but Colchester was one of three that escaped the sanction. A whistleblower alerted the Keogh team towards the end of the programme abut the tampering with records and this was passed on to the CQC for follow up. Those involved in the Keogh process say there was not sufficient concerns about the leadership of the trust to warrant it being placed in special measures. But the fact such a shocking practice was not dealt with by the Keogh inspection process - which has, after all, formed the basis of the new CQC hospital inspection regime that got under way in September - is a cause for concern. One of the elements of the Stafford Hospital scandal was that there was evidence out there about the poor care that patients were receiving. Patient surveys and complaints all pointed to the fact that something was not right. The problem was that the people with the power to act either ignored the warning signs or missed them. Did the same happen here? It is too early to tell. But what we do know is that the trust had a much higher than expected number of complaints being made against it, according to the CQC. Unions including Unison and the Royal College of Nursing also say they were trying to raise the alarm, but managers dismissed their concerns. Prof Sir Mike Richards, the chief inspector of hospitals, says he has never before heard of anything like this happening anywhere else. But what this case proves is that problems of this nature are very difficult to spot. The CQC inspection team only found evidence of tampering after being told exactly where to look. That raises the prospect that it could be going on undetected elsewhere. However, as the new hospital inspection regime is rolled out - by the end of 2015 all hospital trusts will have been visited - inspectors are bound to be keeping an eye out for this sort of practice. </body>

      <title>Will it be a bleak winter for the NHS?</title>
      <description>Is the NHS in for a tough ride in the coming months?</description>

      <body>The NHS knows it's coming, but the big question is whether it can do anything about it. Winter is traditionally the toughest time for the health service, particularly for AandE departments. Waiting times are often at their highest as hospitals struggle to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors with injury and illness. And it looks like this year will be the worst one for a long time. Last winter the NHS in England missed it's waiting time target from January to March as waits hit their longest for nearly a decade. Any hopes that this was a one-off blip have already been dismissed. The summer was the worst on record for many years. The major AandEs - known as type one - missed their four-hour waiting time target during the spring and summer. It prompted Labour to accused the government of overseeing the "first summer AandE crisis in living memory". Doctors are worried too. Bernadette Garrihy, of the College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that staff were preparing for "what may be our worst winter yet". "We have got severe weather problems on the way, increased incidence of respiratory tract infections - things like winter vomiting bugs - we know that this puts our departments under huge pressure." But NHS England's medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh says plans are in place to help relieve the pressure. The government made an extra £250m available in the summer to help this winter. Another £250m will follow in a year's time. This is going direct to the worst-hit AandEs as well as surrounding community services, such as getting pharmacies to open longer. The idea is to give patients with less serious conditions more options other than AandE. Sir Bruce believes the early planning this year will help "decongest" some of the pressure points. But it is clear the problems are much more deep-routed than that. A quarter of visits to AandE lead to an emergency admission, suggesting many patients do in fact have a serious health issue that needs treating and, therefore, cannot be diverted to other parts of the health service. These have been rising since the late 1990s. A National Audit Office report published last week showed rates had risen by 47% in the past 15 years. Of these, a fifth are estimated to be avoidable - that is to say if the patient received better care in the first place the emergency would not have materialised. The frail elderly are the major cause of these admissions, presenting with problems such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. This shows if better support was available in the community there could be a significant reduction in demands on AandE. However, tackling this requires long-term solutions - something NHS England has already recognised as it has set up a review of the whole system. The plans for the future are to be unveiled later this month, but it will be several years before they have an impact. For the time being, those on the front-line in the NHS are bracing themselves for the a long, hard slog in the coming months. </body>

      <description>My year with a lopsided grin and an eyelid on strike</description>

      <body>One year on, the BBC's Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth reports on his slow recovery from Bell's palsy, and frowns, almost symmetrically, at the lack of medical awareness about the condition. It may have taken a whole year, but the muscles on the left hand side of my face have been slowly drifting away from the picket line and getting themselves back to work. The strike, it seems, is over. My left eyebrow, the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do - smile and blink. Shortly after the onset of my Bell's palsy, in October last year, I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter. The response was overwhelming, with many, many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition. So, exactly 12 months on, by way of returning some of that generosity, this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets. Bell's palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight - and unwitting - members of a very strange club. There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they can't move half of their face. Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company, including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan, it is not a club that anyone would choose to join. The paralysis can be shocking and, socially at least, very difficult to deal with. The hardest part for me, as well as the loss of my smile, was the inability to close my left eye. Bell's Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open, unable even to blink, sometimes for months on end. Of course, the other, unaffected eye carries on as normal, merrily blinking away. So, for the record, my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought I'd been winking at them for the past year or so. Except the barmaid in the Nag's Head. That was a wink. The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting. With my left eye stuck open, the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same - in manic two-eyed stare - or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers. Move over Anne Robinson. Thankfully, as the above video shows, at some time between the six- and nine-month mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again. Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus, often at times of stress and lowered immunity, much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed. The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear. Signals then cease to be transmitted along it, paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless. The only treatment that has been shown to have significant, measurable benefit is a course of steroids, but it must be started early, within 72 hours of the onset. These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve. Remarkably, despite this clear evidence, a recent study has shown that many people (more than 40% in the UK) are still not getting the appropriate treatment. And the same study shows that Bell's palsy is more common than previously thought. The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than 7,000 new cases every day. One year ago, as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis, Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity, Facial Palsy UK, which campaigns for better UK services for Bell's palsy and a range of related conditions. "The information available online about Bell's palsy at the moment is pretty appalling," he tells me. "And there is very poor data because there is not enough research." The illness, he believes, is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis. But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take. One patient, a professional musician, is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone. Another, a receptionist, is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public. In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph. As one of the UK's leading experts in the treatment of the condition, Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases: Of course the two questions any new Bell's palsy sufferer wants answered are, "Will I get better?" and "How long will it take?" The good news is that most people make a full recovery - many within a matter of weeks. Something like 70% of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year. Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category. Even without steroids, as my own case shows, most people get back to normal. The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and, by the time I realised how important they were, it was too late. I'm left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them. I'll never know, because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they don't guarantee it. Estimates suggest that up to 30% of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset. Five per cent of sufferers will experience after-effects that are severe and long lasting and, as a result, face the possibility of serious psychological distress. "It may be even harder nowadays," Mr Nduka says. "Face is everything - Facebook, Facetime, Skype. We live in a very image-conscious age." As for me, well I'm almost back to normal, as you can see from the video. I've been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye. But recovery can continue for up to 18 months and the blink, being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve, is often one of the last things to return. Anyway, I'm not complaining. So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement, advice and good humour. You made a difficult 12 months so much more bearable. And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than they'd like, a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more.

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063</url>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>'I wish IVF had never been invented'</title>
      <description>Readers' stories about their experience</description>

      <body>A recent Magazine article by Lisa Jardine about the frequency with which In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) fails prompted readers to send in their own experiences. Five million babies have been born worldwide since 1978 thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, said Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), in the article. Fertility problems are estimated to affect one in six or one in seven couples in the UK - approximately 3.5 million people . Around 60,000 fertility treatments are performed in UK licensed clinics per year, with the live birth rate after IVF about a quarter, according to latest figures (2010) from the HFEA. The latest HFEA figures show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients under the age of the 35 will be successful. And the percentages decrease as women get older. Moreover, costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics Here are some of our readers' experiences with IVF. Karen, Blackpool: I knew about my fertility issue as a teen and met my husband when I was 31 and living and working in France. We put our names down on the waiting list as soon as we could at a French hospital. As I had contributed to the French social security system, we did not have to pay for the treatment. However, we did have to wait four years and I was therefore 36 when I started treatment, by which time we had returned to the UK. Four donor embryos and nothing but empty arms. This treatment gave us nothing but false hope when we could have spent energy on other things at an earlier stage. Of course, you only get to hear the success stories. Thurstan, Farnborough: My wife and I are going through our second round of IVF after the first one didn't work. We got through to the very end successfully, but the final result did not happen. We have to pay for our treatment, yet if we lived five miles in a different direction we would have got it free. We are told the success rate - for us its 25% to 30% - and you do live on hope. It is absolutely crushing to find out it has not worked and nobody can tell you why. Another £6,000 down the drain and you are left with a devastated feeling. Joanna, UK: At 27 I was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, and then with signs of premature ovarian failure - with a three-year time limit for most women with my condition. The technology used in assisted reproductive techniques is ever changing. If we were to wait even just a year, our chances of success would potentially increase. But waiting wasn't an option for us. Without a crystal ball to see how technology will evolve, you're forced into an emotional "now or never" scenario. The first thing we did as a couple was to decide how many IVF attempts to make. We agreed three - the first ending in yet another miscarriage, the second ending in no viable embryos. The second round was by far the worst outcome. Sitting in the clinic car park having arrived a little early, we got a phone call telling us not to come in for what was our embryo transfer appointment, because there was nothing to transfer. No viable embryo. We didn't have the energy to go in for the testing results, we just went home. Even now, putting that into words is horribly difficult and not without pain. Awash with the IVF drugs, which are hormonally altering, you just can't trust yourself to be at your best to make major life decisions. A game plan becomes a must. Had we not decided upon a game plan, I think we would have become addicted to IVF and its offering of hope. Having a game plan was also necessary to make sure we were on the same page. It's a strain within a marriage, but we were fortunate. It's really a gamble. We've all heard the expression "that floored me'". The phone call that caused my knees to buckle, I crumpled in a heap of disbelief and tearful, shaking joy. That's the hope people are offered. J, Cumbria: I'm just about to start my second round of IVF, and as mad as it sounds I wish it wasn't available/invented. It gives you hope and you pray you are one of the lucky ones. It feels like a raffle - how many tickets do you buy? Gemma, Liverpool: At 29, having found out my fallopian tubes were blocked, I started IVF treatment only for it to result in a failure. We had been trying for nearly three years with one miscarriage, devastation and despair to show for it. It felt like we had to wait ages for the referral to the fertility centre, but in reality it was only about three months as I'd had a confirmed diagnosis. We were informed that despite the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stating that we should have three rounds of IVF, our primary care trust only funded two cycles. Straight away you feel under incredible pressure for it to work, as IVF can cost thousands of pounds at a private clinic - there is the worry of where you'd find the money (I work in the NHS, while my husband is a teacher). Arranging time off work, the endless appointments and the invasive treatment you go through in the hope that you'll get your dreamed for family out of it. It gave us hope that despite there being an issue with me, we might be able to have a family. Out of nine eggs, we only got four which fertilised normally, one was transferred and one was frozen. After the dread of a two-week wait, we found out that it was unsuccessful. I'd joined a support group and other women were announcing that their treatment was successful. It's horrible feeling guilty that you wish it was you experiencing joy rather than that woman, although you're so pleased they've been successful. We waited for months for a follow-up appointment, and it was decided that an operation was now my best option, with the possibility of removing my tubes - a scary prospect for any woman, but even worse when you know that's it - take them away and you've literally got no chance of falling pregnant naturally. Add in an extra wait for my operation, and by the time it came round I was a wreck. Amazingly, I didn't have to have my tubes removed. We were given the further hope that we might be able to conceive naturally, but if it didn't occur within a few months, there was still the frozen embryo. Imagine our surprise when four weeks after my operation my period was late. I'm now six months pregnant, and I still can't believe it, it still feels like a dream. Donna, UK: Several years ago, my husband and I embarked on consultations and investigations, then minor operations and IVF to be able to conceive. We had no choice but to go privately - at 34, I was the wrong age to get IVF on the NHS in our area. Having had the initial consultations and started a course of treatment we were told that IVF was not going to help us at all. In a way, we were lucky as our clinic was honest with us and did not try to "sell" us any more treatments or give us false hope - we had only spent £500. This enabled us to cope with the "loss" more easily at this early stage. Our expectations were well managed by our clinic, although I understand that this is not always the case. We have since gone on to adopt a beautiful boy who has made our family complete for the past three and a half years. I hated the invasive nature of IVF, and although I am glad we tried, I would never turn back the clock. We are financially secure now and would have had no savings for a rainy day if we had continued down the route of IVF. Beth, Sussex: Having been through IVF four times, I can honestly say that all these clinics are after is your money. I've never received a phone call or letter after a failed cycle. In fact, the last clinic in Brighton thought we had miscarried but my twins are now six months old. The clinic made no effort to contact us. It's shocking. Zoe, Bristol: I honestly believe that undergoing fertility treatment was the worst decision I have ever made. Before, I couldn't get pregnant because of a combined problem - I have polycystic ovaries and my husband has blocked tubes as a direct result of surgery as a baby - it was nobody's fault. I was 27 when we were referred, 28 when we first went to the clinic and 34 when we had treatment on the NHS. I was offered treatment again when I was 37, but couldn't go through with it. We needed a sperm donor just at the time the law changed on donor anonymity and the sperm banks ran dry - literally! I wrote letters and lobbied everyone we could think of to get treatment (at the time, there was no sperm for private patients either) and after two years our clinic managed to secure us sperm for three attempts. They all failed and in hindsight, I now know they had very little chance of success - funding meant we were offered a less superior form of treatment (and consequently a lower success rate - just 8%) and the clinic also made mistakes with our treatment regime. The pressure to go private was huge because the clinic couldn't offer the treatment we needed - they felt that the best option for us was private treatment and made this clear from the outset, but we couldn't afford it. At the age of 37, I discovered the clinic was able to offer ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) on the NHS, but I no longer met the criteria as my BMI was above 30. (If we had been private patients, BMI wouldn't have mattered). We were told from the outset about the failure rate and at every subsequent appointment. At times it felt that the clinic was only focused on the failure rate. The clinic counsellor only wanted to talk about failure which I felt was inappropriate in the middle of a cycle, whereas if I mentioned failure to the nursing staff, they always brushed it under the carpet, encouraging positive thinking instead. There was a lot of conflicting information - they would be happy to ram failure rates down your throat, but if you mentioned it, it was often glossed over. In the reception area there was a photo board of babies belonging to all the families who had had successful treatment - there was no mention of the other side. They didn't like it if I cried either - I was once told off for "snivelling" by one of the doctors. Undergoing treatment was difficult, but coming to terms with failure was much harder. Now the failure to get pregnant was purely my fault, something the clinic was very keen to reinforce - I was overweight, I had produced too many eggs, I hadn't taken my drugs correctly. Three times my body was fooled into thinking I was pregnant when no baby existed and I feel like I've had multiple miscarriages, except I haven't. I feel like I've lost a child, except I haven't. When people ask me about the worst part of infertility, I tell them it's the silence - they take that to mean that nobody talks about it and that is partly true, but for me, it's the silence which comes from the isolation and the lost friends who have moved on and had children. I no longer have anything in common with my peers. My mother-in-law recently told me that life goes on and it does go on around me, but life also stops with me - where there are no children, there are no grandchildren, no-one to care in later life, no legacy and that is silence which terrifies me. Fred, Whitby: There are unacceptable variations in the success rates of IVF. Living in one of the few areas of the country where IVF is not available on the NHS, we were forced to go private. Our options ranged from 17% at one local hospital, to 65% in a London clinic. We weighed up the options and, despite the significant extra cost and inconvenience, went for the London clinic. We knew we could only afford one cycle, but also that we didn't want to keep trying and failing. The difference was that it was in their interests to make sure everything was perfect before going ahead with the various procedures, as their success rates are their best advertisement. The local hospitals seem happy to press ahead, even when the body is not in its best condition to accept an embryo. Happily, we now have an amazing little boy. Karen, Cambridge: My husband and I went through five unsuccessful IVF treatments, and I have to say this was the worst period of my life. The drugs make you feel awful, it costs a fortune and the grief is overwhelming. All this happens in private, too, trying to carry on like nothing is happening. I went through an NHS hospital and two private hospitals and found very little compassion - we were just on a conveyor belt. We were told it was just "unexplained", but if we had been advised on more tests that were available earlier, we may have found a solution before it was too late. No doubt you will receive lots of nasty comments from people saying we should just adopt, or there are too many people in the world anyway - these usually come from people who haven't had to face that decision themselves and haven't really thought about what it means. Changes in the adoption process are, however, starting to make that a more viable option. Diane, York: I think it's quite naive to think that couples who embark on IVF don't know the odds of success. By the time they reach the decision of going down this route, they already know their chances are low. My husband and I certainly did. However, for us, it was a case of not looking back in 30 to 40 years' time, and saying that we wished we had at least tried. We were lucky, we are very proud parents of a lovely little boy at our third attempt, and we don't regret what we went through for one moment.

      <body>Amid the beeping of heart monitors, a more gentle noise can be heard on the wards of Great Ormond Street Hospital. The soft voice of musician Nick Pickett and the strumming of his guitar are entertaining the young patients in Bear Ward. All the children here are under three years old. Some are facing the long wait for a heart transplant and are being kept alive by the rhythmic beating of a mechanical heart. Sam Wallace's bed is surrounded by balloons, toys and other reminders of home. His grandmother, Viv Green, says the music has a transformative effect. "Oh, Sammy loves music, he has always loved music. "It just makes him happy. He will sing and dance. He loves to dance, he moves with the music as soon as he hears it and it just brightens him up completely - he's a different boy." But is the bedside entertainment having a clinical benefit on children such as Sam? Can a rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star actually help patients? A team at the hospital and University of Roehampton tried to find out. Thirty-seven children were played songs - including Five Little Ducks, See-Saw Marjorie Daw and Hush-a-Bye Baby - while nurses monitored their heart rates and assessed their pain levels. The impact of the music was compared with storytelling or just leaving a child alone. The results, published in the journal Psychology of Music, showed only music was reducing pain, slowing heart rates and improving the children's moods. "It varies from child to child. Not every child wants to have music but for those that opt to have music I think it's very important for them," said Dr Pickett. He added: "I think the most rewarding thing is if you are working with a child that is very distressed, a little one, and you go in, play some live calming, quiet music and watch the child go to sleep, that is great, it's the best reward." One of the study's authors, David Hargreaves, of Roehampton University, is a jazz pianist as well as professor of music psychology. As he sits playing a jazz interpretation of My Funny Valentine, he says the piece calms him down and makes him happy. He says that kind of connection with music is shared even by young children: "Lullabies are something that children are familiar with. They're intended by parents to be used with their children to create relaxation and remove tension." But is this just providing some evidence for what a lot of parents have realised for a long time, that singing to their children can soothe them? The earliest records of lullabies can be traced to Babylonian times. "I think it goes a bit further," he said. "We are beginning to work out what aspects of the music affects what aspects of the physical and psychological response. "Music has an effect on our thinking, our social behaviour, our emotions and our physical responses of course. What we are saying here is that children's wellbeing - their levels of anxiety and relaxation - are mediated by the emotion that the music causes." The brain has a complicated relationship with music. It is something Prof Tim Griffiths, a consultant neurologist with the Wellcome Trust and Newcastle University, has spent a career looking at. He says the brain is analysing the musical melodies and separately responding emotionally. "There are two parts to the musical brain. There is a part which processes sound patterns in the cortex and then there's a more ancient part of the brain which is responsible for the emotional responses to music." It is a process that he says begins in the womb, so he was not surprised that children can benefit from music: "What I think is happening here is that the emotional part of the brain is being stimulated by the music more so than the reading, and this is decreasing the arousal level of the children, and that in turn is affecting their pain response levels." The academic team admit their research is at an early stage, but are convinced music could end up playing a much bigger role in hospitals. </body>

      <title>Academy chains 'should face Ofsted'</title>
      <description>A report from the Education Select Committee says Ofsted should be given powers to inspect sponsors of groups of academies.</description>

      <body>Ofsted should be given powers to inspect organisations that run chains of academies, says a report from a cross-party committee of MPs. The Education Select Committee wants to improve the way groups of schools work together in partnerships. More than half of secondary schools in England are now academies, operating outside local authority control. Graham Stuart, committee chairman, said schools needed clearer incentives to "look beyond their own school gate". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has previously said he believes that sponsors of such academy chains should face inspections. A Department for Education spokesman said: "Ofsted already inspects all school and academy performance, while the Department for Education examines the performance of chains. "Where academies are underperforming, we take action - this can involve issuing a pre-warning notice and ultimately changing the sponsor if there is no improvement." The report by MPs has examined partnerships and co-operation between schools, against a background of greater school autonomy and different levels of accountability. Mr Stuart says his committee supports giving schools "more freedom to innovate" but there also needs to be a "degree of co-ordination". "Otherwise there is a danger that many schools will operate in isolation rather than in co-operation," said Mr Stuart. The report says that while there is widespread support for the idea of raising standards through greater collaboration there is still a lack of incentive for schools to work together. It argues that local authorities have a "critical role" in improving schools and calls on the government to clarify how they can act as brokers between local schools. But with the expansion of academies, it says that academy chains will play an increasingly important part in helping schools to improve. It warns of the need for co-ordination from this "middle tier", between individual schools and central government, particularly in areas where schools are at risk of underperforming. The Education Select Committee MPs say that academy chains should be open to inspection by Ofsted, in the way that local authorities can be inspected. The committee also argues there should be a mechanism to allow outstanding schools to leave academy chains, including without the approval of the organisation running the chain. The MPs also raise concerns that some outstanding academies are not providing support for weaker neighbouring schools and the report calls for closer monitoring. Sir Michael Wilshaw, giving evidence to the committee earlier this year, told MPs that there needed to be a level playing field in the accountability of organisations running groups of schools. "We will be inspecting local authorities and we should inspect academy chains as well, if we identify underperformance," said the Ofsted chief. "I have made that clear to the secretary of state. It is only fair and equitable that we do that. We have not got the same powers at the moment, but I look forward to receiving the powers to do that." Sir Michael told MPs that there was an "ongoing discussion" with the Department for Education, but he thought the principle had been accepted. He also backed the idea that academy chains could be ranked in performance tables in the same way as local authorities. There are now 3,444 academies, representing 53% of secondary schools and 9% of primaries in England. Among these there are 1,600 schools in academy chains, up from fewer than 900 in autumn 2012. "Hundreds of schools are now collaborating on a scale never witnessed before - brilliant heads and teachers are working together, sharing best practice and driving improvement throughout the system, raising standards for their pupils," said a Department for Education spokesman. Labour's schools minister Kevin Brennan said: "Labour has long argued that collaboration between schools is what is needed if we are to deliver a step-change in standards across all schools. In June, we said that all schools would have to demonstrate effective collaboration with weaker schools for them to be rated as outstanding by Ofsted. "This report - by a cross-party group of MPs - is a damning indictment of David Cameron's schools policy that drives competition between schools instead of incentivising partnerships between them." </body>

      <title>Autism detectable 'in first months'</title>
      <description>Signs of autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, early research suggests. US researchers analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism had shown diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - in the first few months of life. The findings, reported in Nature, raised hope for early interventions to tackle autism, said a UK expert. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the disease, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <description>Lack of detail in the government's figures for its teacher training plans for next year may hide possible teacher shortages, claims a university expert.</description>

      <body>Lack of detail in the government's figures for its teacher training plans for next year may hide possible teacher shortages, claims a university expert. Figures published last Friday lack crucial details, says James Noble-Rogers of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET). Mr Rogers says he fears such details may reveal key shortages of trainees. The government said it planned to publish a detailed breakdown of the figures "in the next few weeks". Mr Rogers has issued a freedom of information request to the government for the data. He says Friday's figures failed to give details of how the government has allocated numbers by subject or of how many trainee places have been allocated for secondary or primary education. "This information has been published as a matter of course in the past", he writes in a letter to the schools minister, David Laws. "It should not be necessary in an open democracy for UCET or anyone else to resort to legislation to obtain information of this kind." Last week's figures revealed how many teachers the government plans to train next year. They also showed a further switch in funding for teacher training from universities to the School Direct scheme which allows teachers to learn largely on the job in schools, but with theoretical and specialist training provided by universities. The figures showed that 41,100 teachers would be trained in the year starting September 2014, rising from 38,900 this year. Of these the numbers trained by Schools Direct will rise from 9,600 in the current academic year to 15,400 in 2014. The numbers trained on postgraduate university courses will fall from 20,000 this year to 16,200 next year. Overall, Mr Rogers says this represents a rise in the numbers trained by School Direct from 25% to 37%. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that detailed allocations, including a breakdown by subject, would be published within the next few weeks "once they have been confirmed by universities and schools. "School Direct has built on many excellent long-standing relationships between schools and universities. "We want these relationships to continue to give applicants plenty of choice about their preferred route into teaching. "Higher education institutions are involved in seven in 10 School Direct places "We hit 95% of our recruitment target this year." The spokeswoman added that three candidates applied for every School Direct place last year, and that requests from schools for School Direct places had "shot up from 9,600 to 17,700 in the past year". Mr Rogers told BBC News said the broken down data was usually issued at the same time as the overall figures. He said the delay this year would make it difficult for training providers, particularly universities, to plan. "The only apparent reason it should now be kept secret is to prevent a timely and legitimate analysis of data before allocations are finalised", says the letter to Mr Laws. In August, analysis of School Direct recruitment figures by Prof John Howson of Oxford Brookes University suggested a possible shortfall in the numbers of science and maths specialists. </body>

      <title>Two-year-olds 'should start school'</title>
      <description>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested.</description>

      <body>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged families should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested. Many children from poor backgrounds have a "dire" start to their education, according to Baroness Sally Morgan. They can be up to a year and a half behind their better-off classmates by the age of five, she said. The Pre-School Learning Alliance described Lady Morgan's suggestion as "beyond belief". "Who would disagree with Sally Morgan that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need considerably more support. However, to suggest that placing two and three-year-olds in schools is the answer is beyond belief. "Social inequality needs to addressed in many ways and taking very young children away from their parents and placing them in formal schooling is not the answer," said Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch. Mr Leitch added that international research put the UK's specialist early years network of childminders and nurseries among the world's best. "I am struggling to understand why anyone would promote pushing our youngest, most vulnerable children into schools rather than using the existing network of specialist local provision offered by childminders and group settings," he said. The government said it was making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two. Speaking at an event organised by an academy chain, Lady Morgan argued that poor parenting, poor diet and poor housing meant disadvantaged children were often not ready to start formal schooling at five. She called for a "big brave move" in early years education, with more nurseries attached to schools and a particular focus on the poorest children. She said more schools should become "all through", taking pupils from age three or younger to age 18. Her comments echo a recent Ofsted report which suggested that poor five-year-olds are 19 months behind their more affluent peers. "What a dire start to their educational life," said Lady Morgan. "Those children had low level social skills especially reading and communication. "They're not ready to learn at school. Weak parenting, low educational attainment of parents, poor diet, poor housing and so on. "The gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group. "No-one has yet got a grip on this problem", she said. "I think there needs to be a big brave move on the under-fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly, I think, to look to strong providers to go further down the system. We've increasingly got five-to-18 schools, why not three-to-18?" A Department for Education spokeswoman responded: "We know that teacher-led early years education has a positive impact on children, especially on those from low income backgrounds. "That is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with Ofsted when doing so, and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two-year-olds." The spokeswoman said government reforms would ensure all children, regardless of background, get a good start in life with all three- and four-year-olds entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. Educational Psychologist Dr Jo van Herwegen of Kingston University said formal learning risked damaging children's development if started too early. "It's really all about what you define as being 'school' education and the government needs to understand that children learn through play at this young age. "Formal learning is extremely difficult as children's working memory and language abilities are still developing, "Forcing children to learn in formal settings and sit tests regularly can risk creating performance anxiety and an aversion to learning later on in life". Wendy Ellyat of the Save Childhood Movement said the key was to "prioritise child-flourishing and well-being over educational attainment", whether children were with childminders or in schools or nurseries. "We also need to look at how best to support parents as the most important thing for such young children is to have stable, loving and supportive home lives." </body>

      <body>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates. The University of Leicester says they will be available to students based in the UK or EU starting degree courses in 2014 and will last up to 12 weeks each. The aim is to give students insight into what employers want from recruits and to compete in a global jobs market. "Crucially we want our students to be able to adapt to the challenges they face when they leave", said career development manager Raj Patel. The university says the scheme will be the first of its kind offered by any top-20 higher education institution in the UK. All the internships will pay the equivalent of £12,000 to £16,000 a year pro rata, says the university. Some will be within the university's own departments, others will be in the private sector. Bob Athwal, director of career development, said a growing number of employers were using student internships "to feed their talent pipeline". The new scheme will involve an application and selection process, with a programme of workshops to help students prepare. The university has promised the interview process will provide "every campus-based home or EU student with an opportunity during their degree". Mr Athwal says this idea is to showcase "a rich pool of talent" among Leicester undergraduates. The graduate jobs market has been tight in recent years. Figures produced by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) in July this year forecast a 4% fall in graduate vacancies, with leading UK employers reporting an average of 85 applications for each job. A separate survey of more than 18,000 university leavers, published in June, suggested graduates who had had internships were three times more likely to get jobs. The study by High Fliers research found that more than one in three students had completed work experience or internships with a prospective employer. </body>

      <title>Forced academies 'costing too much'</title>
      <description>An internal document leaked to the BBC suggests ministers are prepared to force schools to become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits.</description>

      <body>Ministers are making struggling schools become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits, a leaked government document suggests. Civil servants planning for budget cuts at the education department suggested ministers consider value for money before forcing academy conversions. But Education Secretary Michael Gove overruled this cash-saving idea as "totally wrong", the document reveals. The education department says academies are the best way of improving schools. But the National Union of Teachers said Mr Gove's "pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost". Academies are privately run schools funded by the state in England. They have control over their own admissions, and increased freedoms over what they teach and pay staff. They can get up to £110,000 in start-up costs. Where underperforming schools are unwilling to convert to academy status, it is enforced in several steps - including sacking the governors and replacing them with a hand-picked interim governing body. Ultimately the secretary of state can issue an academy order requiring a change in the school's management. The Department for Education (DfE) sees the academies programme as its key engine of school improvement, but critics have described the process as heavy-handed and undemocratic. The DfE plans to cut its administrative budget by £290m by 2015-16. The document, entitled What Stops at the DfE, looks at where savings could be made. It says forced conversions are "very resource intensive" and reveals that the government's underperformance strategy is in need of extra funds. But despite tight department budgets, it is clear that conversions where the costs outweigh the benefits - often where there is strong opposition to a change - are still being pushed through. The document suggests more account should be taken of a "cost-benefit analysis" in "determining the approach to academisation of underperforming schools". But it stresses that the secretary of state does not want to see such value-for-money checks on the programme and that the changes have not been made. It adds that ministers had expected to see some schools or heads change their mind about becoming academies as a result of high profile cases such as that of Downhills Primary School, which it cites as an example. Mr Gove ordered the Haringey school be taken over by an academy chain, despite 94% of parents opposing the move, and claims that it was already on a trajectory of improvement when the conversion was being proposed. Legal action was threatened as a result and teachers walked out on strike. But the document says: "Achieving success in difficult areas has a bigger potential pay-off and is important for the reputation and reach of the overall programme but both this and forced conversions are very resource intensive." And it warns: "If we limit the number of forced interventions there is a risk that we don't tackle the worst performing schools (which would not otherwise become academies)." It is also clear that the DfE is seeking extra cash to ensure the forced academies programme is maintained. It talks about "securing the additional resource needed for the underperformance strategy" and says it will not place "any arbitrary limits on forced conversion activity". And indeed the document is peppered with references to how money can be transferred from the oversight of maintained schools so that the "increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time work on a new admissions code, which the document says might prove inevitable because of various pressures, has been axed. And oversight of boarding schools and home education is being downgraded despite civil servant warnings that there could be child protection risks as a result. A DfE spokesman said: "Ministers are clear we will not stand by when a school is failing its pupils, and that the strong support of a proven sponsor is the best way to see rapid and sustainable improvements. "While it is vital that government constantly considers ways to cut bureaucracy and save public money, we make no apology for prioritising improving the education of children in the country's worst performing schools." National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower said: "Despite civil servants identifying the forced academy programme as an activity that could be cut back in order to address the disproportionate cost to the public purse, this document makes clear that ideology won out over sound public policy decision making. "It is increasingly evident that Michael Gove's pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost. "At a time when school budgets elsewhere are being cut is really quite an inappropriate use of public finances." David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said: "In many cases, giving more flexibility to local areas to take swift action, for instance by recruiting new governors and staff, would be a better and more cost effective way of improving standards. "Councils want to be able to intervene more quickly and effectively in poorly performing schools but are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. "Money spent on conversion costs could be saved by enabling earlier intervention by councils who are focused on school performance rather than management structures." </body>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <title>Engineering gap 'constrains' economy</title>
      <description>The UK's economic recovery could be constrained by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser.</description>

      <body>The UK's economic recovery could be "constrained" by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser. Prof John Perkins, chief scientific adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has identified "a substantial demand for engineers". He has issued "a call to action" to government, industry and educators to "step up" to inspire future engineering talent and address skills shortages. Business Secretary Vince Cable said too few teenagers were studying science. "Engineers must have a strong foundation in maths and science, especially physics. "The number of young people choosing these subjects post-16 is relatively low, especially amongst women," said Mr Cable. In his Review of Engineering Skills, Prof Perkins says the UK already relies on "inward migration" to fill skilled jobs in key sectors such as oil and gas extraction, aerospace, and computer, electronic and optical engineering. "This should not be our long-term solution. "We should support the UK's young people by preparing them to compete for highly paid, skilled engineering jobs, improving their career prospects and reducing the need to import engineering skills," says the review. It calls for "purposeful and effective early intervention to enthuse tomorrow's engineers" and ensure they have the "solid academic foundations to engage in the subject". The report calls for as many young people as possible to study "rigorous curricula in maths and science". In particular it says the UK lags behind its competitors in the number of 16- to 18-year-olds studying maths. Prof Perkins says the profession suffers "from widespread misconceptions and lack of visibility that deter young people, and especially girls from pursuing it as a career". The report refers to polling carried out for the Tomorrow's Engineers Week campaign, which suggests that only half of 11- to 14-year olds would consider a career in engineering. This dropped to 35% among girls and only 24% of parents of girls said they thought engineering was a suitable profession for their daughters. Prof Perkins draws "some comfort that we are heading in the right direction" with initiatives to inspire future engineers, a focus on maths and science in schools, more apprenticeships and "our continued strength in higher education". His 22 recommendations urge both short and long term action to "get the right messages to young people" - particularly girls, to ensure vocational training is high quality and high status and that "higher education continues to deliver". The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it was making available nearly £49m to boost engineering skills. From January some £30m of this money will allow employers to bid for match-funding for training schemes to address specific engineering skills shortages. Another £18m will fund an elite training facility in Coventry, while Tomorrow's Engineers will get £250,000 to encourage schoolchildren into engineering. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, which represents almost 6,000 companies, said: "The report rightly shines the spotlight on the need for a pipeline of talented future engineers, with credible recommendations on how this can be achieved. "Whilst this is a long-term task, the message from employers is clear - we are ready to take on the challenge." Anne Spackman of the charity Career Academies which runs internship schemes to prepare schoolchildren for employment said efforts to "grow the number of potential recruits" into engineering were crucial. "Engineering is an area rich in job opportunities but lacking the skilled workers to fill them," said Ms Spackman. </body>

      <title>London online course draws 200,000</title>
      <description>The first annual figures from a UK online course show a high initial take-up, but also a high dropout rate.</description>

      <body>More than 200,000 students signed up for the first wave of online courses offered by the University of London's International Programmes. The university has published details of the take-up of four online courses - so-called Moocs - in their first year. This also showed the high dropout rate with only about 9,000 students completing a course. Mike Kerrison, director of academic development, said the the experiment so far had been "very successful". The University of London's International Programmes specialises in providing degrees by distance learning and has been providing such courses since the 19th Century. Last year it became one of the UK's early adopters of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses - which deliver university courses through the internet. It offered free courses through the US-based Coursera network, which now has more than five million registrations. This snapshot from the University of London's International Programmes at the end of the first year shows the scale of interest in such online courses, with 210,000 students signing up. Reflecting the demand for higher education, this is about four times the total number of conventional students studying with the University of London's International Programmes. Among those people who signed up, 90,000 were categorised as "active students" who participated in one of the four pilot courses, which were about computer programming, law, malicious software and the use of photography. The university says there was a strong sense of value from students, with 91% rating their experience as good, very good or excellent. These online courses, with no formal entry requirements, have a high dropout rate, and in this case there were 8,843 students who received a "Statement of Accomplishment" for successful completion, fewer than one in 20 of those who initially signed up. "Considering that the courses are free and allow students to do as much or as little work as they like, the number of students engaging in the course materials is considerable," said Mr Kerrison. There has been particular interest in online universities in the US, where prestigious institutions such as Harvard, MIT and Stanford have been at the forefront of creating online platforms such as Coursera and edX. These have also spread into international networks with major recent partnerships in China and France. The online model has also begun to be refined, with Harvard developing courses for a much smaller, pre-selected group of online students, with the aim of much higher completion rates. These have been dubbed Spocs, small private online courses. This autumn also saw the launch of a UK online university partnership, Futurelearn, which has announced new courses starting in January, bringing to 29 the total number of courses available. This includes Shakespeare's Hamlet: text, performance and culture, from the University of Birmingham and Exploring our oceans, from the University of Southampton. So far Futurelearn has attracted students from 190 countries with five of the pilot courses already reaching their planned quotas. Chief executive Simon Nelson said the response in this first term had "exceeded all our expectations". </body>

      <title>Not reporting abuse 'must be crime'</title>
      <description>Teachers and other professionals who fail to report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the former director of public prosecutions says.</description>

      <body>Teachers and other professionals who do not report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the ex-director of public prosecutions says. Keir Starmer said under a British "mandatory reporting" law, those who failed to act could be sent to jail. Declassified files uncovered by BBC Panorama show how schools have repeatedly failed to protect children from sex offenders. But the government said mandatory reporting was not the answer. While statutory guidance has been issued previously urging professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report child abuse, failure to do so is not a crime in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1967 makes it an offence to fail to disclose an arrestable offence - including those against children - to police. Mr Starmer, who was succeeded as director of public prosecutions by Alison Saunders on Friday, said it was time to "plug a gap in the law" that had been there for a "very, very long time". "If you're in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, and you have cause to believe that a child has been abused, or is about to be abused, you really ought to do something about it," he said. He said a criminal penalty would "focus people's minds" and said there should be "immunity for individuals if they did report". He said the penalty for failing to report abuse could be a short jail sentence or a fine. "There are just too many examples of cases where those who have suspected abuse have not really done anything about it and the perpetrator has either got away with it or, worse still, been able to perpetuate the offending." He added: "I would have a reasonably broad category of individuals that were subject to the law. "Obviously school teachers, but others in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, including other educational institutions, even sporting institutions." Similar laws are already in places in countries including the US, Canada and Australia. For the first time, the Catholic Church and the Church of England have also come out in support of mandatory reporting. Bishop Paul Butler, head of safeguarding at the Church of England, said: "We have to think of the child first, not ourselves, not the institution, what's best for the child." But the government has no plans to change the law. The Department for Education said professionals "should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child". "This happens every year in many thousands of cases and numbers of referrals have increased over recent years," it added. "Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children." And Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the Action for Children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are not convinced that making it mandatory will do what we need it to do." She said the reporting of child abuse in the UK was on the rise and that a "huge issue" was that "teachers and people across the system are not sufficiently trained to see those early signs of abuse". It was important they knew how to spot those signs "and not to feel that they may be prosecuted if they don't", she added. But Jonathan West, of the Mandate Now coalition of charities, welcomed Mr Starmer's call, adding that "social services can't actually act on cases they haven't been told about". He added: "Schools, other organisations, often don't really want to have a child abuse scandal on their hands. "It is surprisingly common that schools want to handle such things in house." Ever since the Jimmy Savile revelations, Panorama has been investigating secret historical records and looking at what government officials knew about abuse in children's homes and boarding schools. Declassified government files going back 60 years show how senior civil servants were well aware that school authorities routinely hid child abuse - preferring instead to protect the reputation of their own institutions - and the law was an inadequate deterrent. One of the most detailed historical files in the National Archives is about a cover-up at the Royal Alexandra and Albert school. Today it is a well-regarded state boarding school in Reigate, Surrey. However, research by Panorama has revealed that seven child abusers worked at the school between the 1950s and the 1980s.

      <title>GCSE overhaul in England made final</title>
      <description>Exams regulator Ofqual confirms it is making changes to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation.</description>

      <body>Exams regulator Ofqual has confirmed the changes it is making to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. A new grading system will use numbers instead of letters, and coursework is being scrapped for most subjects. The changes will be in stages, starting with pupils due to take GCSE exams in 2017. Those who turn 13 in this academic year will be the first. English and maths will be the first subjects affected. Pupils will begin studying the new courses in English language, English literature and maths from the autumn of 2015. And about 20 other popular GCSE subjects will be revamped in the same way, ready for teaching a year later, in 2016, with the first exams for those taken in 2018. The changes apply to England only. Wales is planning its own GCSE shake-up, but Northern Ireland is not planning any changes. Scotland has its own exams system. While they come in, pupils in England will have some exams graded with numbers and some with letters, leading teaching unions to warn this will be confusing for pupils, parents and employers. Exams will be graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest. Pupils who fail will be awarded a "U" for an unclassified result. All exams will be taken after two years of study, rather than in modules taken at various stages over two years, meaning a return to the format of O-levels, which pre-dated GCSEs. And there will be more marks awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar. The head of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said the changes were "fundamental". "This is the biggest change in a generation," she said. "They [GCSEs] have been around for over 25 years but now we are seeing fresh content, a different structure, high-quality assessment coming in. "It's a significant change for students and for schools." Ms Stacey said the move to a numerical system meant a new grade was being added and that would help examiners distinguish between candidates' performance - especially at the top grades. She suggested that the move away from traditional grades might be hard for some people to understand, but was important. "The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly," she said. At the same time, the government is confirming changes to what has to be studied in English language, English literature and maths, because the overhaul of exams covers both what is studied and how it is assessed. It says in English literature, students will have to "study whole texts in detail, covering a range of literature including Shakespeare, 19th Century novels, Romantic poetry and other high-quality fiction and drama". The new maths exam will cover more topics and will be more challenging, the government says. Details were released on Friday morning. For maths, Ofqual is keeping the present arrangement where pupils can be entered for either a higher- or lower-tier paper in maths, depending on their ability. But in English, that division has been scrapped and one exam will be taken by all. At the moment, students who are entered for easier papers can be awarded only the maximum of a C grade. The government says young people were let down by the old exam system; that frequent testing meant not enough time was spent on "deep learning" and not enough attention was paid to grammar, spelling and punctuation. Schools Minister Elizabeth Truss says the changes will improve students' "core skills" in maths and English and raise expectations. "What we want to do is encourage schools to focus on those core skills that employers really want, because that is what is going to help our children get jobs when they leave school," she said. Headteachers' representative, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), gave what it said was a "cautious welcome" to the changes. Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said: "There is much to welcome in today's announcement, especially the measured approach Ofqual has taken to this significant task. "We have always agreed that GCSE can be improved to better prepare students to meet the needs of the world we live in today. But the constant tinkering with GCSEs we have had in the past has not been helpful." Unions representing classroom teachers warned that a shift away from coursework and having different levels of exams for different abilities could damage some pupils' education. Secondary school teacher and spokesman for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Jovan Trkulja, said that less able students could suffer. "Exams are challenging and they should continue to be challenging. But we have to remember that setting the top of the mountain as the baseline means someone has to fall behind, and I feel for the sense of failure for the less able," he said. Shadow schools minister, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, said he had "reservations" about some aspects of the changes and that the move towards a numbered grading system was a step back to the 1970s. He said he agreed that the pendulum "might have swung a little too far on coursework", but there was now a danger that "it will swing too far the other way". "Having everything staked on one final exam is not great for all pupils," he said. </body>

      <title>Council tracks school-run on CCTV</title>
      <description>A London council is thought to be the first local authority to confirm it uses CCTV cameras to spot illegal school run parking.</description>

      <body>A north London council has confirmed it is using CCTV cameras to target parents who park illegally on the school run. Enfield Council has set up cameras outside schools that record number plates of cars parked illegally for more than three seconds. The system's manufacturers say other boroughs are also trialling the system, but did not confirm which ones. Local authorities say the cameras will improve safety but opponents say it is just a way of raising money. The data is recorded and reported back to councils and either a warning letter can be issued or a penalty fine. Paul Pearson, of parking campaign group Penalty Charge Notice, said there was not enough places for parents to park. Alex Henney, the general secretary of the National Motorists' Action Group, said a civil enforcement officer should be used instead of the cameras. "It seems to me that probably there's an agenda to generate money - that is illegal," he said. "In my view, the sensible approach is to get the council and school head together to discuss it with the parents to sort out some arrangement." However, Amanda Philips, the head teacher at Old Ford Primary School in Tower Hamlets, east London, said the school had tried to address parking issues by communicating with families, the local council and the police but there is a problem. "It is as always a very small number of families with particular cars that we can identify that we constantly have conversations with," she said. Dave Richmond, the joint director of camera manufacturers Videalert, said he did not believe it would be a "cash cow" as once several tickets were issued, drivers would stop parking illegally. He said the problem with using civil enforcement officers is that drivers comply with the rules when an officer is present, but revert back to their normal behaviour when they have gone. "If you watch the videos that I have seen, some of the behaviour of drivers outside schools is like the Rocky Horror Show," Mr Richmond said. "It is really bad and therefore this is a safety issue and it needs to be dealt with." In a statement, Enfield Council said it was "committed to improving road safety for all pedestrians, especially children walking to and from school, and reducing road safety related casualties. "This is a pilot project and we will evaluate its success before making any decisions on future use," it said. </body>

      <title>'Raise tuition fees with inflation'</title>
      <description>University tuition fees should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged.</description>

      <body>University tuition fees in England should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged. Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey and president of Universities UK, says a £9,000 fee cap is "not sustainable". "The whole issue is that fees can't remain frozen for ever", he told Times Higher Education magazine. The National Union of Students (NUS) said last year's trebling in fees had already far outpaced rising costs. Sir Christopher's comments follow a recent call from the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Andrew Hamilton, for undergraduate fees to be "more closely related to the true cost" of a degree at Oxford, £16,000. Last month Prof Hamilton said the funding shortfall meant Oxford faced an annual funding gap of £70m. Sir Christopher said that Surrey had "several subjects where we are losing substantial sums of money teaching UK and EU students". He said these included science, technology and engineering courses. Sir Christopher added: "On aggregate the £9,000 was perhaps a reasonable starting point, but it really needs to have a sensible indexing linked to it." He said that the £9,000 maximum fees paid by students would be worth only around £8,250 by 2016 when inflation was factored in. However, Sir Christopher told the magazine that he was not an advocate of a major jump in fees: "I don't think that £16,000 is a likely scenario in the near future." Universities UK will publish a report next week on the future of university financing. This is expected to look at how universities will fund a predicted 26% rise in demand for university places within the next 20 years. Universities Minister David Willetts has said a rising birthrate will mean the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000. The paper is expected to explore where universities will find the capital to expand their facilities and accommodation. Universities UK points out that the rise in tuition fees paid by students was accompanied by a corresponding cut in the level of government funding for universities. The NUS said suggestions that undergraduates should pay more were unlikely to win sympathy from students or their parents. Union president Toni Pearce said: "What seems to have been missed here is the inflation-busting increases on the upper limit on tuition fees just last year, when the cap was nearly tripled to an eye-watering £9,000. "We've already seen a huge shift onto the shoulders of individuals through higher fees that far outpace rising costs. "Students and their families are facing a huge financial squeeze. The value of both earnings and student financial support is falling in real terms and the cost of making ends meet is increasing by the day." The government said its reforms had put the higher education sector on a more sustainable footing. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We believe the £9,000 fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching, with many institutions now planning to invest more in improved teaching facilities for students. "We want to ensure that going to university remains affordable for students and it is based on their ability, not their ability to pay." </body>

      <body>The University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) has received what it says is one of the biggest ever donations to a UK university. The £20m gift - worth more than a quarter of its annual turnover - would be "transformational", SOAS said. It came from the Alphawood Foundation in Chicago, set up by Fred Eychaner, a former Asian art student at SOAS. The money will pay for building upgrades, research and scholarships. Prof Paul Webley, director of SOAS, said the university was "thrilled" to be working with Alphawood. "SOAS has been studying and interpreting the development, languages, arts and cultures of Asia for nearly 100 years and this project will draw on that knowledge as well as further reinforce our position as a world-leading centre for the study and interpretation of South East Asian art." The donation includes £5m towards building development and £15m to be spent on research into South East Asian Art as well as improving links with the region. SOAS said the money would be used to bring post-graduate students from the south-east Asia to London. It also wants to establish three new academic posts, including professorships in Buddhist and Hindu art, and develop links with like-minded institutions in countries such as Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. Mr Eychaner, a broadcasting tycoon who owns a string of radio stations, said he wanted his money to build bridges, especially in areas of Asia held back in the 20th Century by war and politics. "Alphawood Foundation seeks to stimulate and expand the study of South East Asian art at all levels - from an educated and interested public to museum professionals to new PhD-level scholars. "We chose to advance this goal by making our largest gift to date to SOAS because this school creates a very special learning and research environment where West meets East." Mr Eychaner - who owned a television station until he sold it to Rupert Murdoch's Fox network - studied for a post-graduate diploma at SOAS, which currently has more than 5,000 students from 130 countries. </body>

      <title>How technology best boosts learning</title>

      <body>An inner city primary is at the heart of a project to test how technology can be used to boost children's learning. Rosendale Primary, in south London, won a £253,000 grant for the research which will involve 1,400 pupils in 24 schools in London, Essex and Manchester. Rosendale pupils use tablet computers to photograph their work and tag it with notes about how well they learned. The Lambeth school's head teacher, Kate Atkins, says the aim is to help pupils develop a range of learning strategies. "Poor learners are often over-confident about the power of their memories and can struggle to find alternative strategies. "We need to encourage them to think about how they learn and to try something else." Children at the school are encouraged to reflect on every piece of work or unit of learning. They are asked to think about which bits went well, what they struggled with and what they might need to do to improve when they next revisit the subject. A key part of this is to ask children how they felt about each piece of work, for example many children find conducting a science experiment exciting and fun but hate having to sit down and write it up afterwards, says Ms Atkins. "An emotional reaction is a key part of the learning process." The research project aims to test whether the strategy actually improves pupils' attainment. It will be tested at 24 two-form-entry schools, one form will carry on as normal, the other will record and reflect on their learning using digital note-taking. Children will be tested at the start and finish of the project to measure their abilities and the results evaluated at Manchester University. The project is one of seven in a £3.5m strategy by the Education Endowment Foundation and Nominet Trust to evaluate the impact of technology in schools . The charities say the aim is to "rigorously test" new ways to use technology to improve attainment, particularly of less advantaged children. The grants will support 18,000 pupils in 260 schools across England. Another project, centred on Shireland Collegiate Academy in Sandwell, West Midlands, will test the effectiveness of a "flipped learning" approach. In effect pupils do their homework before the lesson, watching a video or web presentation on a new concept the night before. The lesson itself then focuses on a more detailed exploration of the concept, perhaps experimentation or discussion, and on helping struggling pupils. Dan Sutch of the Nominet Trust said: "The more we can understand where technology best supports learning and teaching the better." The Education Endowment Foundation said the grants would help identify the most effective ways to use digital technology to improve learning for the most disadvantaged pupils. Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said schools spent huge sums on technology but there was too little evidence of its effectiveness. "The gap in educational outcomes between rich and poor is the biggest barrier to social mobility we face and it is essential to find out if and how technology can be used to help close it." </body>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Home Office of "sabotage" after visas were denied for two Chinese teachers returning to work in Scotland through a partnership programme. Mr Salmond, who is currently on a visit to China, has lodged a protest. He said the move amounted to sabotage of Scottish government efforts to build cultural links. The Home Office said it was looking into the matter which was being taken seriously. The teaching programme is run by the Confucius Institute, backed by Strathclyde University and the Scottish government. It involves teachers from China offering Scottish pupils the chance to acquire skills in Mandarin and Chinese culture. Five teachers from Tian Jin municipality were due to return to Scotland for a second year, but two of them have been told their visas will not be renewed. Mr Salmond has written to UK Home Secretary Theresa May voicing his shock and dismay and warned that the episode risks damaging Scotland's relationship with China. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said: "It is an absolutely extraordinary situation you couldn't make it up. It is deeply offensive to the Chinese and it is a decision that needs to be reversed as soon as possible. "This amounts to sabotage of a programme that everyone thinks absolutely fantastic and doing great work in Scotland. "The importance of this is quite fundamental. Our argument is to have a successful economic relationship with China you must have it underpinned by a successful cultural relationship, that is the view of the Chinese, that is the view of the Scottish government. "If you undermine one you undermine the other." A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We have received the letter from the Scottish government and we have been in contact with them over these cases. "We are taking this matter seriously and will be looking into the decisions." </body>

      <description>The biggest education provider you've never heard of</description>

      <body>This is the biggest education provider you've never heard of. Until now. The Alison project - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - has already signed up more than two million students to more than 500 online courses. It's adding another 200,000 each month and founder Mike Feerick is confident this expansion could accelerate even more rapidly and reach a billion students towards the end of the decade. But this ambitious project isn't another Silicon Valley spin-off, fuelled by venture capital and a surfeit of sunshine and flow charts. This global digital empire is based in a technology park in Galway in the west of Ireland. If there was such a thing as successful grey skies thinking, on a damp autumn day, this would be a prime location. But Alison's days in the shade could be numbered, as it has won a prestigious international award this week at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar. The online learning platform has already won an innovation award from Unesco. So how has it stayed below the radar? While the new wave of online courses - so-called Moocs, such as Coursera and edX, have become darlings of the digital media, why has Alison not had the same attention? Mr Feerick says the big difference is who they are trying to reach. It's the academic versus vocational divide being played out in the digital market. "The people we're helping do not have a huge voice," says Mr Feerick. While the Moocs are associated with high-status universities, Alison's focus is on the vast numbers of people around the world needing to improve their vocational skills and training. There are courses in subjects such as computer skills, learning English, basic accountancy, building a website, food safety, immunology, introductions to legal studies. He is planning to expand into secondary school level, with video lessons customised for national exam systems, beginning with maths. Organisations from the IMF to the OECD to the European Union have all spoken of the urgency of providing vocational, workplace skills to tackle dangerously high levels of youth unemployment. But Alison has been putting this into practice. A deal struck earlier this year will provide online training for 12 million young people in the Arab world. Many of those accessing the free courses are at the margins of formal education - low-skilled workers, the unemployed and immigrants. Within the coming months, India is expected to become the biggest source of learners, overtaking the UK and US. Nigeria and the Philippines are rapidly growing markets. Mr Feerick wants to use online technology to offer free lessons in the most important basic skills that people need. As he puts it, 99% of the people are learning the same 1% of information, again and again. His other challenge to the established order, heresy to some, is to question the necessity of exam certificates. If people are studying for a specific skill, such as learning to touch-type or a language, he argues the key question is whether they can put the lessons into practice. He says the fixation with a paper trail of certification is part of protecting an educational status quo. "They desperately want to keep the same system." Alison's other big difference is that it is profitable. The courses are free because of advertising revenue. The social mission is underpinned by a strong business sense. Mr Feerick says his approach to social entrepreneurship was influenced by his own business mentor, Chuck Feeney, a celebrated US investor in ideas and education, who took him under his wing when Mr Feerick had been studying at Harvard. Mr Feeney is a famously frugal and publicity-shy billionaire and philanthropist, who is currently helping to fund New York's hi-tech science campus. Inspired by his example, Mr Feerick says he wanted to combine thinking big commercially while maintaining a sense of social purpose. The idea of free education online, available around the globe, became his focus. "Education underpins all social progress. It's the tool of the most ambitious revolutionary in these technological times, you can change the world if you can change education." He sees the internet as making an irresistible impact on education, in the way it has in other industries, with a few giants emerging to dominate the multi-trillion dollar education market. "There is going to be huge consolidation worldwide into a small number of platforms for learning, because it's going to be very hard to compete with them," he predicts, likening it to how Amazon has become the global bookseller. "So these platforms are going to be huge, some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world." There are other projects challenging the idea that online learning should be dominated by prestigious Western universities. The Kepler project, launched in September, is using online technology to bring university lessons to Rwanda, to students who otherwise would have no chance of getting into higher education. Using laptops they can take lectures and resources from top universities putting course material online. In the Rwandan campus there are local teachers who are able to provide face-to-face lessons, with a ratio of 30 students for each member of staff. If they successfully complete their course they can get a US accredited degree. There are 50 students in a pilot phase, being charged $1,000 per year. If it works, this will expand rapidly and the longer-term aim is to reach 7,000 to 10,000 students. "There is a rising demand for higher education in Africa that can't be met by traditional models," says Jamie Hodari, chief executive of the non-profit organisation. The economy in Rwanda is growing, but if it wants to compete with other countries it is severely limited by low levels of education. "They have completely hit a wall," says Mr Hodari. Rwanda has ambitions to become a regional technology hub, but it lacks a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. At present, Mr Hodari says "so many children leave as the top of their class and go on to become taxi drivers, because there is no other pathway". The Kepler idea reflects the way that technology is dismantling the component parts of education - separating the local teaching from the online course materials and the international accreditation. If the format works, Mr Hodari says it could be replicated in other parts of Africa and beyond. It could be a "university in a box" that others could copy, he says. "The playbook will be right there in front of them." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>
      <date>1380062273</date>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <title>Harvard tops global CEO league table</title>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <title>Why we're afraid of 'zombie' faces</title>
      <description>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist.</description>

      <body>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist. A research project by the Open University's Stephanie Lay found a particular fear of "near-human" faces. It explains why blank eyes, automatons, masks and ventriloquists' dolls are common cinema devices to instil fear. The psychologist says a study of 3,000 people found widespread "repulsion" at near-human faces. The finding is part of research into the so-called "uncanny valley" phenomenon in how people react to robots. The effect was discovered in the 1970s in research into whether giving robots human features would make them more reassuring to humans working with them or using them in the home. The research found that people were initially more receptive to robots which were made slightly human looking, but if they began to imitate humans too closely, people were repelled. Instead of being reassured, too close a resemblance to a human form was seen as sinister. Mrs Lay's research is examining this "uncanny valley" effect from a psychological perspective. She describes it as "the sense of unease that accompanies the sight of something almost, but not quite, human". It is the sudden plunge in reaction at a point just before a face is fully humanised. For instance the empty eyes of a zombie figure in an otherwise human face is highly disconcerting. And it explains why the faces of dolls, clowns and dummies are used so regularly to frighten audiences. "A consistent finding of the survey was people's reactions to images where the face was convincingly human but with lifeless eyes or where eerily human eyes appeared in a non-human face," says Mrs Lay. "These were perceived to be the most uncanny and disturbing of all the images and explain why characters such as zombies in horror films unsettle people to such great effect." This is particularly the case with psychological horror films, she says, rather than bloodthirsty shockers. She says this uneasy reaction could be caused by the sudden disruption in how the human brain processes human faces. When people begin to interpret something as a human face, they are left with a sense of disquiet when they come against something that does not match their expectations. Being able to "read" another person's eyes is particularly important in this process of interpreting faces, she says. "It may be that our normal processing mechanisms are not being engaged for these faces, causing the unsettling effect when people want to like a near-human face, but realise something is wrong." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <body>Lecturers and support staff at many UK universities are staging a walkout over pay. Unions say there is "strong support for the action" and 149 institutions are affected. But university employers say support for the strike is "not widespread" and disruption has been "minimal". Rallies are planned for many cities over lunchtime as part of joint action between the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. Union members say their pay has failed to keep up with rising living costs and have rejected a 1% pay offer. But university employers say the "vast majority" of staff think the offer is fair. Officials from the UCU say early reports are that some buildings and departments - including many libraries - have been closed. Teaching at Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University has been cancelled and the chemistry department at Loughborough is shut, they say. The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1%, which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2009. They say universities will face the "most widespread disruption for years". UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: "Staff, from porters to professors have walked out this morning in protest at some of the most sustained pay cuts since the Second World War. "Nobody wants to be on strike, but a 13% real-terms pay cut as vice-chancellors' pay continued to increase and universities' surpluses built up simply is not fair." She said the unions had heard of closed departments and buildings and that some universities had cancelled all teaching for the day. "If the employers try to spin the action as having little impact then it merely shows how out of touch they are with what is really happening on the ground at universities." There was a 35% turnout in the UCU strike ballot, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Universities had warned students some classes might be cancelled and that some some facilities could be closed. Helen Fairfoul, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), told BBC News fewer than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote for strike action. "We can see the strike is not widely supported," she said. "The vast majority of staff think this is a fair offer. This is a difficult period. No pay levels in any sector have kept pace with inflation." She added that salary costs in most institutions would actually rise by about 3% this year because some staff would get incremental increases and merit awards as well as the 1% increase. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We are disappointed that the unions have decided in favour of industrial action. Students have the right to expect that their learning will not be disrupted by such action." </body>

      <title>Call to drop term-time holiday ban</title>
      <description>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking term-time holidays, will be delivered to the government on Wednesday.</description>

      <body>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking holidays during term-time will be delivered later. The 126,000-signature document will be given to the Department for Education. Campaigners say many families cannot afford the higher cost of a break during the school holidays. The DfE said it was giving schools more freedom to set term dates - potentially meaning parents could book cheaper holidays. Until last month, heads could grant up to 10 days' leave a year for family holidays in "special circumstances". Since 1 September, head teachers have no longer been able to grant any absence outside school holidays except under "exceptional circumstances". The reference to the 10-day limit has been removed from the regulations. A petition against the ban, started by a parent and hosted on the 38-Degrees Campaigns By You website, had attracted 126,275 signatures by Tuesday evening. The petition says the ban will "adversely affect" families who cannot afford the higher prices charged to holidaymakers during the school holidays. "Also not all businesses can allow their staff to be off all at the same time", says the petition. "All children who have a good attendance record should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy quality time with their parents on an annual holiday of up to 10 days once per year." Craig Langman, the parent who started the petition, told BBC News his six-year-old son still recalls a holiday the family took to Rome during term-time two years ago and has done school projects based on the trip. "It was probably more educational than being in school to be honest. "He still remembers the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum." Mr Langman says the cost of breaks during the school holidays can be three times as much as during term-time. "I am not asking kids to have a guaranteed extra two weeks on top of their existing 10 weeks' holiday each year - but this blanket ban on term-time holidays with the threat of a fine is almost killing families." He argues that the decision as to whether to grant a request for extra days off school should remain with head teachers. "I feel that most MPs in the government had holidays with their parents when they were younger so why do they think they have the power to stop our children's generation from enjoying the same lifestyle," says Mr Langman. "Soon only rich kids would be able to go on holiday and that's unfair on everyone else." A DfE spokesperson said: "If children aren't in school they lose out on valuable learning time and have to waste more time catching up. That's why children shouldn't be taken out of school during term time unless absolutely necessary. "We are giving all schools the freedom to set their own term dates, for example David Young Community Academy in Leeds operates a seven-term year starting in June. This means that parents and teachers can benefit from cheaper holidays at the end of September. "We want schools to consider changes to term dates that will work for their pupils and their families." </body>

      <title>Extra marks for exam illness up 10%</title>
      <description>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because pupils had problems such as a minor illness.</description>

      <body>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because of pupils having problems such as a temporary illness, the highest level on record. The figures from exam regulator Ofqual showed a 10% increase in such cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There were 374,000 requests approved for "special consideration" in marking this summer's GCSEs and A-levels. The most common adjustment was worth 3% of the maximum exam mark. The figures from Ofqual show that there was an even higher level of requests from schools for such special consideration - rising by 13% on the previous year to 415,200. Only about 10% of these requests were rejected. The extra marks are allowed because an exam candidate has faced an unexpected disadvantage, which could range from a minor illness to something more serious, such as a bereavement. The exam regulator describes the criteria as "temporary injury, illness, indisposition or another unforeseen incident immediately before or during the exam's period". It could also allow a student to receive a grade reflecting their ability if they were unable to attend an exam. The maximum adjustment is 5%, such as a close family bereavement. A "minor illness on the day of the exam" could gain a pupil an extra 2%. As well as these adjustments for unexpected problems, Ofqual says that candidates taking a further 209,900 exam papers were given special access arrangements because of a disability or a medical condition. These numbers of special access cases are falling, both in terms of request and approvals. But the most common request remains asking for an extra 25% time for candidates, which was allowed for 107,400 exam papers. Other types of help included using a reading device or someone to act as a scribe, such as for people with problems with their sight. The exam report from Ofqual also shows a sharp year-on-year rise in penalties on staff for "malpractice" in exams, up 62% to 97, although this was lower than in 2011. The most common type of staff malpractice was giving "inappropriate assistance to candidates" and the most common penalty was a written warning. There were also 135 penalties for exam malpractice for schools and colleges, almost all of which were written warnings. Among pupils, there were 2,590 penalties from this summer's exams - similar to last year. The most common form of cheating was using "unauthorised material", which usually meant a mobile phone. But there have been declining numbers caught trying to use mobiles - down for the fourth consecutive year to 814 cases. </body>

      <title>Neets are 'public health time bomb'</title>
      <description>Youth unemployment in the UK is a "public health time bomb waiting to explode", according to a review by the World Health Organisation.</description>

      <body>Youth unemployment in the UK is a "public health time bomb waiting to explode", according to a review by the World Health Organisation. It warned of the health consequences of high numbers of Neets - people not in employment, education or training. More than one million 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK are classed as Neet. The report also said the UK was behind other European countries on female life expectancy, deaths of children under five and child poverty. The WHO and the University College London Institute of Health Equity analysed the reasons for differences in life expectancy across Europe. For the UK, it highlighted the dangers of young people being out of work. Wealth is tightly linked to life expectancy and is one of the major reasons for the north-south health divide in the UK. Being unemployed has immediate health consequences, including an increased risk of depression and suicide. Being out of work in the longer term increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and stroke. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who led the review, said: "Unemployment may be falling in the UK, but persistent high levels of the number of young people over 18 not in employment, education or training is storing up a public health time bomb waiting to explode." The length of the fuse is thought to be 10 to 20 years. The report said women and children in Spain, Italy and Cyprus would fare better than those in the UK. It said life expectancy for women was 83 years in the UK, behind Spain and France at 85 and Germany at 84. The report added that mortality rates in the under-fives were higher than most countries in the west of Europe and even some eastern European nations, including the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Figures also showed that one in four children in the UK live in poverty - a figure higher than other countries such as Iceland, Cyprus and Ireland. Prof Marmot said: "We are failing too many of our children, women and young people on a grand scale. "I would say to any government that cares about the health of its population: look at the impact of their policies on the lives people are able to lead and, more importantly, at the impact on inequality. "Health inequality, arising from social and economic inequalities, is socially unjust, unnecessary and avoidable, and it offends against the human right to health." Prof John Ashton, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: "Michael Marmot is absolutely right that the number of 'Neets' is a public health time bomb. "There is a lot of evidence to show that being out of work is bad your health. "It is disgraceful that a generation of young people are growing up in a world when unemployment is the norm, not the exception." The Department for Work and Pensions said it was "really encouraging" that the numbers of young people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance was falling, but "we're not complacent - we'll continue to do everything possible to give young people the best chance in life". A Government spokesperson said health inequality was taken "very seriously". In a statement they said: "The Chief Medical Officer raised this issue in her recent report on children's health, outlining the need to invest early in our young people to give them good foundations and the best start in life. "We have already successfully protected the poorest from falling behind and last year we saw a reduction of 100,000 children in workless poor families. In addition, we are training an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015, and 16,000 of the most vulnerable families will be helped by family nurses." </body>

      <title>Internet chat 'has a positive side'</title>
      <description>Experts say there should be greater focus on the positive effect internet forums and chatrooms can have.</description>

      <body>Internet forums and chatrooms can have positive effects that should be more widely acknowledged, experts say. The call comes after Oxford University researchers carried out an analysis of 14 different studies looking at how young people use the internet. The review - published in the Plos One journal - said a number of studies had found a link between internet use and self-harm and suicide. But it said others had found the internet could be a positive influence. The dangers of internet use have received widespread coverage this year. In one case, in August, 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire was found hanged after she had been sent abusive messages on a social networking site. Since then research by the NSPCC has suggested a fifth of 11 to 16-year-olds have had negative experiences using the internet. The Oxford University research highlighted a number of dangers from internet use, including the normalising of self-harm and the risk of bullying. It also said there was a "strong link" between internet forums and an increased risk of suicide in particular. But the researchers said some studies had shown that internet forums could support and connect socially isolated people. There were also examples where forum users encouraged positive behaviour, advised others to seek help and congratulated each other for not harming themselves. Report author Prof Keith Hawton said: "Communication via the internet and other electronic means has potential roles in both contributing to and preventing suicidal behaviour in young people. "The next step is going to be development of therapeutic interventions using these channels of communication, especially to access those who do not seek help from clinical services." Joe Ferns of the Samaritans added: "We should acknowledge that many people are using suicide forums and chatrooms to anonymously discuss their feelings of distress and despair, including suicidal thoughts, which may have a positive impact on the individual. They may be expressing feelings that they have never disclosed to anyone in their offline lives. "Rather than concentrating primarily on ways of blocking and censoring such sites, we should think about online opportunities to reach out to people in emotional distress." </body>

      <title>Ed Balls attacks Shoesmith payout</title>
      <description>A six-figure payout to former Haringey children's services head Sharon Shoesmith "leaves a bad taste in the mouth", says shadow chancellor Ed Balls.</description>

      <body>A six-figure payout to the ex-head of Haringey children's services "leaves a bad taste in the mouth," shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said. Sharon Shoesmith, who earned £133,000 a year, won a ruling in 2011 that she was unfairly sacked after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter. BBC Newsnight revealed the payout could cost Haringey Council up to £600,000. In a statement Ms Shoesmith bid a "final farewell" to Haringey, adding she hoped to resume work with children. Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old, died in 2007 after months of abuse. The boy had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Three people were jailed in 2009, including his mother. The Court of Appeal concluded Ms Shoesmith had been "unfairly scapegoated" and her removal from office in December 2008 by the then Children's Secretary Ed Balls had been "intrinsically unfair and unlawful". One government source told BBC Newsnight that the cost to Haringey Council could be as high as £600,000, although Ms Shoesmith is expected to receive a lower sum. The exact figure may not emerge as there are confidentiality clauses preventing its disclosure but it will be significantly short of the £1m figure it had been reported she was seeking. However, it would appear the package is more than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested Ms Shoesmith was entitled to a minimum of three months' salary plus pensions contributions. Three months' salary would have been about £33,000. Mr Balls said his decision in 2008 as children's secretary to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her job had been right. He told the BBC: "An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services. "They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department, and responsible, ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money." Earlier, Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the payout became "inevitable" after the Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Balls "had made a complete botched job of her dismissal". But he added: "This is going to leave a really bad taste in taxpayers' mouths that a not insubstantial amount of public money is being used to pay off somebody who presided over a dysfunctional department in Haringey [where] a 17-month-old boy died in horrific circumstances." Care minister Norman Lamb said what happened in the aftermath of the Baby P's death was "extraordinary" but he was not in a position to judge the authority's decisions. "But it is pretty shocking, the scale of the reported payout, given what tragedy unfolded in that particular borough." In her statement, posted on an online networking site, Ms Shoesmith said: "A final farewell to Haringey as my case concludes. I wish those of you in children's services, especially in Haringey, success, strength and courage in all that you do. "Children have been my life's work and I hope to continue in some capacity soon now that my PhD is almost complete." A statement from Haringey Council confirmed it had reached a settlement with Ms Shoesmith but that the terms of the settlement were confidential and it was unable to comment further. Some of the cash will come from central government, but Haringey council will foot most of the bill, it is understood. An exact figure is yet to be agreed. The Department for Education declined to comment on the story when contacted by the BBC. But one source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was "furious" about the secrecy over the amount paid to Ms Shoesmith, believing it to be "indefensible". Downing Street said the Department for Education's contribution to the payout would be made public. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Ms Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a settlement since the May 2011 ruling. Ms Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Peter Connelly's mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child's death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <body>School dinners have improved but there should be a drive to get more children eating them as the take-up remains stubbornly low, an association of school caterers says. Free schools and academies are currently exempt from the government's nutritional guidelines, but research found 92% of parents wanted to see the same standards applied to all schools. The chair of the Lead Association for Catering in Education said people still remember soggy cabbage and lumpy custard, but reckoned "there has been really good hard work" to improve the food, and that: "We are finally cooking on gas". Anne Bull said only 1% of packed lunches meet nutritional standards for school food, and that hot school meals were "by far the best option".

The group's chief executive, Helen Fairfoul, made the statement as lecturers and support staff at universities across the UK went on strike in a row over pay. The University Colleges Union, Unite and Unison claimed that pay had failed to keep up with rising living costs. Ms Fairfoul told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast: "Higher education pay has done remarkably well and is still holding up... University academics are still amongst the third highest paid employed professionals in the United Kingdom." </body>

      <body>A former Top Gear driver has called for the fundamentals of driving to be taught earlier in life. Stunt driver Ben Collins, who used to play 'The Stig,' claims that pupils should be taught about safe driving at school so that they are more prepared for the early stages of real world driving. Collins told BBC Radio 5 live's Breakfast: "In those first two years of we have to fend for ourselves. We kind of learn in a haphazard way as we have those near misses." </body>

      <description>Will the US deport German home-school families?</description>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, says that a strand in the home schooling movement developed in the 1970s when some Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <title>Housing association helps tenants to read</title>
      <description>The housing association that also teaches literacy</description>

      <body>A few months ago, Christopher had to ask a neighbour or a friend to read him details of a personal hospital appointment or a letter about his rent. Now he can do it himself. In and out of care homes all his life, Christopher left school at 13, without being able to read and write properly. But his life changed when he saw an advert in the local community centre about the Eastlands Homes Literacy Beacons Project in Manchester. After six weeks of one-to-one tuition with a mentor, he was beginning to make sense of the words around him. "I can pick up my mail and look at it, I can pick up books. Before I'd get a brown letter and I'd have to ask a friend or a partner to help," he says. "It's like being proper independent. I don't have to knock on someone else's door. It's given me more independence and I'm proud of it like, I really am." The Literacy Beacon Project was set up 18 months ago by the not-for-profit housing association Eastlands Homes for its tenants and others in the area. Eastlands has 8,000 properties across east and south-east Manchester and many of these are in some of the most deprived wards in the country. So far more than 40 people have completed the course. The idea is simple - adults who struggle to read and write are matched with a volunteer "champion" or mentor who, after some training, meets with them regularly on a one-to-one basis over a six-week period. The scheme started when front-line staff realised many tenants were struggling to read correspondence from them, using excuses like they had not received the letter or had lost their glasses. Neighbourhood services manager Danny O'Sullivan says: "We knew a lot of our tenants had literacy problems. "From a business point of view, it does us a good turn because they can read our letters and so on, but the drive behind the scheme was to help people in the community. "We want to improve people's lives, we are a community project as well as a housing association." Danny says a lot of people who believe they cannot read or write actually do have some basic literacy skills, but have such low confidence they have convinced themselves they are illiterate. He says: "If something frustrates us, we tend not to do it. Take technology - you'd rather ask the kids. You can do it, but the frustration stops you. "The issue is the negative stereotype in your head, 'I can't read, I don't need to read, I'm not going to read.'" Amanda approached the Literacy Beacons Project because she was struggling to fill out contact sheets in her role as a volunteer mentor for offenders recently released from prison. "I was always behind with the sheets, but I couldn't get anyone else to do it because it's confidential information. Now I've got the confidence to pick up a pen. "I think it's because of the one-to-one support, they made me feel dead confident. I had no confidence to pick up a pen. "But here it's the best thing because it's a one-to-one. If I'm in a classroom I get all nervous and worried I'm going to be called thick, because that's what I've had in my life. It's all about my confidence, my champion gives me loads of encouragement. "It's amazing, I've got someone saying I'm good and that makes me feel better about myself. It's made me feel really confident in my reading and writing. "I can go for a job now, I've got the confidence to go for that job and go to the interview." But it's not just the tenants who have benefited from the scheme. Eastlands has found that those who volunteer as champions have reaped huge rewards. Paul, a champion who has helped four people develop their reading, says: "I retired a few years ago and I get so much reward out of this - I never got the buzz that I get out of this. It's time-consuming but it's lovely to do. "As much as they're learning, we're learning from them because we're understanding their issues. All my working life I've never enjoyed anything like this." Sam, who has mentored five tenants, adds: "It's so rewarding to see what you've achieved for somebody. "It's better as well because we're not teachers and we don't spell everything right. They feel at ease with one person and they don't have to feel that someone's ahead of them." Sam was particularly touched by the case of one elderly lady who had been constrained by literacy problems all her life. "I had a 75-year-old lady and only her husband knew she had trouble with reading and writing," she says. "When he passed away, she was on her own. She was buying the same things in the supermarket because that was what she recognised. But now she can read the labels - she has the choice." Champions are not just community volunteers - staff working for the housing association are also encouraged to mentor those who sign up for the project. Eastlands communications manager Abi Mistry says: "I had a woman with three kids and she'd never been able to leave her children little notes. When she finally wrote a letter to her eight-year-old son, she cried - and I cried, it was so emotional. "She had left school with no qualifications, had her first child at 17 and couldn't help them with their homework. To see her confidence grow was amazing." The housing association is now so confident with the scheme, it hopes to take it to other areas of need, such as prisons and rehabilitation centres. Danny O'Sullivan says: "We're in talks with the National Literacy Trust. We're trying to grow it, to get it elsewhere. It's a great system and we hope it'll go out further. "I'd like to see a lot of other organisations doing it and not just housing associations. It would be brilliant in prisons, in probation offices, drug rehabilitation centres, community charities, anywhere that socially deprived people are accessing. "We understand it well enough now to take it to other places." Amanda wants to see the project benefit other people like her. She says: "I just think it should be rolled out everywhere because there are people out there, especially older people, who would be too scared to say, 'I can't read or write.'" In the meantime, the literacy project has been shortlisted in the Business in the Community category at the Manchester Be Proud Awards. </body>

      <title>Can US universities learn from India?</title>
      <description>Should the US learn from India's technology students</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24743439</url>

      <body>By the year 2020 the US is expected to have 1.4 million computing-related jobs, but will only have the capacity to fill a third of them. Should schools in the United States be looking to Asia for tips on how to get more students to study science and maths? From a young age, children at India's top schools have it drilled into them that they must excel in maths and science. Their goal is to win a coveted place at one of the 16 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and a fast track to a high-flying job. The IITs enjoy no international ranking but they have been recognised by the US Congress and Microsoft founder Bill Gates for their contribution to US innovation. Graduates have gone on to be leading high-tech innovators - for example the creator of Google news Krishna Bharat, and the co-founders of online poker site PartyGaming studied at the IITs. Each year about one million Indian students sit the entrance exam hoping for this kind of success, but just 10,000 people, or 1% of them make it. There are nine times more people applying for each place than there are applying to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the highest-ranking universities in the world. One student who made the grade is 21 year old Utkarsh Malhotra. He is now in his final year but says passing the entrance exam was like scaling an academic Mount Everest. "I know people who changed their diets, who changed their sleeping patterns, who changed everything for this examination," he says. "IITs are like a pressure cooker situation so I don't know if this prepares us for future life well or not." Eighteen year-old Twinkle Aurora is hoping to follow in Malhotra's footsteps. She attends a private coaching institute and spends 13 hours a day, six days a week studying to pass the exam. "It's very tough because you can't stay in touch with social media like Facebook and WhatsApp - they take a lot of your time, so you have to sacrifice lots of friendships… but after one year when you've slogged your way through the year you get something that's big," she says. But once the students are in, the pressure remains. I met Malhotra on a Friday afternoon but instead of winding down for the weekend, he was working hard. "I don't know [if any other] institutes in India have exams on a weekend but this one does. The pressure is immense and you grow to live with it," he says. So what makes the IITs so successful? "We get the best students in the country," says Suneet Tuli, the dean of research and development at the Delhi campus. "And for a country of 1.2 billion, the best is really the best." "The second thing - this is part of our culture, [education is] based a lot on mathematics, so that gives them good analytical skills." Some think the US could learn from the way India approaches science and maths, including Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google. She thinks there should be much more emphasis on computer science in US schools. "Nine out of 10 schools right now are not teaching computer science. If you think about the future and you think about how important computer science is going to be it's a problem - we're going to need a lot more kids to be able to have those skills," she says. "I would really like it to be like reading and math and science and spelling - they are requirements - everybody takes it, everybody learns it, and that's the way I think we need to think about computer science and coding in the future." There has been some criticism of the methods the Indian education system uses with its reliance on rote learning, and whether this really prepares the IIT students for the wider world. Steve Stepanian, head of Indian operations for the management consultancy Bain and Company, has some reservations. "At the more junior levels they are very quantitatively sound, they are very responsible, no problem. The issue becomes [when] they're given an open-ended question - that is where there seems to be more of a struggle," he says. For example, they would get the basic figures spot on, but when he asks what advice they would give to a chief executive - "that is where you draw a real blank," he says. In his experience, the number crunching by US students may not be as accurate, but "when I come to that question of what the CEO should do, they are much more capable of synthesising that and pulling together a much more cohesive answer and make a recommendation". But for Wojcicki it is about the balance between learning the basics and thinking creatively: "I look at Silicon Valley and we have so many great engineers that have come from India," she says. "American schools are really good [when it comes to] thinking about the creative component but we also need kids to learn the basics."

      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>A torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics has blasted off into space - as part of efforts to showcase next year's games in Russia. A Soyuz rocket is delivering the torch to the International Space Station. On Saturday, two Russian cosmonauts will take it on a historic first spacewalk. The torch will not be lit. The event is part of a rebranding exercise by Russia, designed to portray it as a strong, modern country, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Baikonur. The Soyuz rocket blasted off at 04:14:25 GMT from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koici Wakata from Japan - are taking the torch to the ISS, which it is due to reach in six hours. The Olympic symbol will be handed over to fellow cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky, who are already on the orbiting station, when they go on the spacewalk on Saturday. "Our goal here is to make it look spectacular," Mr Kotov said earlier. "We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work." The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. The Sochi torch will then be returned to earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year. It is all part of the elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It is also the most expensive one so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. In yet another minor setback, the flame has gone out several times since the torch relay began last month. </body>

      <title>Volcanic lava that flows for a year</title>
      <description>Researchers capture the first footage of the glacial flow of rocky obsidian lava, still flowing months after an eruption.</description>

      <body>An explosive volcanic eruption in Chile has given scientists the first direct insight into the strange motion of rocky lava known as obsidian flow. Rather than a red river of molten rock oozing down a mountainside, this lava is a thick, rubble-strewn mass of rock. Dr Hugh Tuffen, from the University of Lancaster, and his colleagues took the first measurements of this lava flow. They found that it kept moving more than a year after the eruption. Their results were published in the journal Nature Communications. To carry out their study, the team visited a volcano in the south of Chile called Cordon Caulle in January 2012. "There had just been an enormous eruption [in June 2011] that was still continuing," Dr Tuffen told BBC News. This explosive eruption produced rhyolite - the rock that creates the "incredibly sticky magma" that results in these strange obsidian flows. "This was our chance to get right in there and see an obsidian flow moving for the first time," he said. No-one had previously witnessed an obsidian flow moving. As well as witnessing the ongoing volcanic eruption, the researchers recorded the lava - a heaving mass of black rock more than 30m (100ft) thick - as it "slowly creaked its way down the mountain". They captured footage and images of the flow. Piecing these images together produced a 3-D model of the obsidian flow's changing shape. "What was exciting was that it kept on going," said Dr Tuffen. "Even after the eruption had stopped - it was still flowing away many months afterwards." Initially, the lava advanced several metres per day, then as its thick rocky crust cooled, it slowed. But, according to Dr Tuffen's data, over a year after the eruption, the lava was still advancing at a rate of 1.5m to 3m per day. Crucially, the lava flow altered as pieces of the rocky mass collapsed and the hotter lava leaked out in what the scientists referred to as "breakouts". This, Dr Tuffen said, revealed "lots of secrets about how lavas advance". "So now we can make new models that can encompass all the different sorts of lavas on the planet and how they move." Dr William Burton, of the US Geological Survey, said: "What these guys have done is observe processes along the margins that may govern how these things flow - the breakouts. "Knowing what they learned in this paper may help predict where this flow is going to go next. "So if it is going close to a town you might be able to use some of the lessons they learned to [work out changes in its movement]." Dr Burton added that the most likely place for the next rhyolitic volcanic eruption was near Mono lake, in northern California - a popular ski area. Prof Peter Sammonds, an earth scientist from University College London, said the imaging techniques the team had developed would be "powerful" for the future study of volcanoes. "The modelling of these lava flows is quite important," he said. "These patterns can seen as a general feature [of volcanoes] - it doesn't simply relate to this one. Volcanoes that have produced rhyolitic eruptions are found all over the world, and have been some of the biggest on Earth. These include the US "supervolcano" eruptions at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, and Novarupta in Alaska, which erupted in 1912 and was the biggest of the 20th Century. </body>

      <title>Climate wavering 'not justified'</title>
      <description>Government advisers say the UK is not out of step with major nations in reducing emissions.</description>

      <body>Britain is playing its part in a worldwide bid to reduce emissions and should not weaken its proposed cuts, says a report to the UK government. The Committee on Climate Change says no change in global science or policy justifies a slackening of effort. The report was compiled after Chancellor George Osborne said the UK's competitiveness might be put at risk by leading the world in curbing emissions. The CCC research challenges this assumption. "It is not accurate to say that the UK is leading the world on this," the CCC’s chief executive David Kennedy told BBC News. "We aren’t acting alone. We have made ambitious commitments, but other countries have too – they are acting on them and developing low-carbon technologies. "Some of our European counterparts are discussing targets stricter than ours for 2030 so if we want to be part of the low-carbon revolution we will have to make sure we aren’t left behind." Mr Kennedy said China was now clearly global leader in clean technology: "China is leading the low-carbon revolution. It has committed to invest in 700 Gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2020 – that’s 10 times the whole UK power system. "They are investing in five million electric vehicles – in multiples of what we are doing here. “Even the US is cutting its emissions and is committed to doing so in coming years.” The shale gas revolution in the US has forced down emissions because gas is much less polluting than coal; the report says it is likely that the US will meet its commitment to reduce 2020 emissions by 17% on 2005 levels. It points out that China has committed to reduce carbon-intensity by 40-45% from 2005 to 2020, and introduced policies to deliver in its 12th five-year plan. With ongoing action, China’s emissions could peak in the early 2020s, the report says. It says Germany has also made medium-term commitments in line with the UK. But Mr Kennedy admitted that the world’s efforts were still nowhere near enough to keep the world on track for a high likelihood of a stable climate. The World Meteorological Organization has announced that greenhouse gases has reached another record. UNEP’s Emissions Gap report also warned that delaying emissions cuts would make the task even more expensive. The CCC was founded to advise government on how to meet the Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to reducing CO2 80% by 2050, in a step-by-step process. For several years the Chancellor has expressed fears about the impact of climate policies on the affordability of energy in the UK. At the Conservative Party conference he told The Times that Britain should not be "in front of the world" on tackling climate change. But the Climate Change Act was designed specifically to make it hard for future politicians to weaken long-term priorities when faced with political difficulty. In order to reduce the UK’s targets, there needs to have been a weakening of the science base or of international action. But the CCC’s report says: “We conclude in this report that, in respect of science, international and EU criteria, there has been no significant change in the circumstances upon which the budget was set. In this regard, there is therefore no legal or economic basis to support a change in the fourth carbon budget. A Treasury spokesman said: "We want to tackle climate change, but it should be done in a way that doesn't put huge costs on people's energy bills or destroys manufacturing jobs. The shale gas revolution in America shows you can reduce carbon emissions, bring bills down and create jobs." The committee thinks the UK is most unlikely to experience a US-style shale gas boom. The committee is concerned at the political backlash against green energy, which it believes has been fuelled by newspaper campaigns. It says renewable energy subsidies are likely to bring down energy bills in the medium term if gas prices continue to rise as many analysts forecast. Doug Parr from Greenpeace said: "The CCC reminds us that tackling climate change is as urgent as ever, but the Treasury persists with its scientifically illiterate campaign to unravel domestic climate policy. The Lib Dems must not allow a watered down fourth carbon budget." Rhian Kelly, the CBI's director for business environment, said: "It seems sensible to maintain the fourth carbon budget at this point in time. However, as the CCC suggests, it would be prudent for the Government to look again at the UK's emissions reduction pathway once EU discussions have concluded, to make sure we remain aligned." Jonathan Grant from consultant PwC said: "The Committee is right to highlight the danger of changing tack or rolling back regulations, as it could undermine business and investor confidence that long term government policy will deliver what is needed to tackle climate change. "In the short term, UK energy emissions increased 2.6% last year, much higher than GDP growth, because of an increased use of coal in power generation. The cost of wholesale transformation of energy generation and other green measures highlights the challenge that politicians are facing everywhere on climate change." Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <title>'King of gore' dinosaur discovered</title>
      <description>A new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the earth 80 million years ago is discovered in southern Utah.</description>

      <body>A new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the Earth 80 million years ago has been discovered in southern Utah. It was closely related to its slightly larger relative, Tyrannosaurus rex, but lived earlier, making it the largest living land predator of its time. Growing to about 30ft (9m) long, the predator has been named Lythronax argestes which means "king of gore". The research, published in the journal Plos One, highlights once more that the age of discovery is far from over. The team also hopes this new find will help uncover what the climate was like towards the end of the age of dinosaurs. "It's always exciting to find new species but what's really significant is what these species tell us about their ancient world," said Randall Irmis, co-author of the study at the Natural History Museum of Utah, US. "This was a very different place 80 million years ago. It was a very lush, wet, tropical environment and there were no polar ice caps at the time." First discovered in 2009, the partial skeleton included a number of bones from the skull and some from the rest of the body. The fossils were then excavated and studied in the lab. The new discovery was closely related to T. rex and shows that similar features evolved 10 million years earlier than previously thought. Lythronax had a short and narrow snout and forward slanting eyes. Like its evolutionary relative, it had a head full of sharp teeth and was a ferocious predator, the largest of its ecosystem. The team also uncovered the most complete fossils of another named species of Tyrannosaur - Teratophoneus curriei. It was previously only known from a few skull bones but the team now have more than 70% of its skeleton. "There's a whole diversity of different branches of the Tyrannosaur family tree that are waiting to be found out there," Dr Irmis told BBC News. It was previously unclear why there were so many different Tyrannosaurid species present in a similar area, as the animals were able to move around freely. The palaeontologists believe this was due to a changing of sea level. "We think that when the sea level was high it was isolating areas in western North America that caused different species to evolve in isolation and that's why we're finding so many different species," added Dr Irmis. He explained that the creature had been named the "King of Gore" because of its super-predator status. The second part of its name "argestes" comes from Greek poet Homer's naming of a south-westerly wind. "Tyrannosaurids were the really large predators in their ecosystem. It's fairly certain based on what we can see on their skull, teeth and body size they probably ate whatever they could fit in their mouths," added Dr Irmis. Another research member of the team, Joseph Sertich of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, US, explained that the back of its skull was very wide which gave it good hunting eyes. "One of the things that makes T. rex different from other dinosaurs is that it is able to look forward, it has binocular vision. Lythronax had that feature as well, its field of view could overlap which probably made it a better hunter," Dr Sertich told BBC News. "It was the apex predator of it's time. It was the oldest advanced Tyrannosaur of its group, which is quite surprising. "This is the tip of the iceberg. It's amazing what we're finding in southern Utah right now. You can walk over some of the hills and find fossils littering the sides of the slopes," he added. Mike Benton at the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved with the study, said the new find was important for understanding patterns of evolution of the Tyrannosaurids. "Previously, Tyrannosauri origins were uncertain, whether in Asia or North America, and the new find tends to suggest a mainly North American evolution for the group." </body>

      <title>Asteroid hit rate 'underestimated'</title>
      <description>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia this year has been underestimated, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia earlier this year is much higher than was previously thought, a study suggests. Researchers have found that space rocks of a similar size to the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk are hurtling into the Earth's atmosphere with surprising frequency. Scientists say early warning systems need to be put in place. The study is published in the journal Nature. Lead author Professor Peter Brown, from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action programme: "Having some sort of system that scans the sky almost continuously and looks for these objects just before they hit the Earth, that probably is something worth doing. "In the case of Chelyabinsk, a few days' to a week's warning would have been valuable." Fireball The asteroid that exploded over Russia on 15 February this year was estimated to be about 19m-wide. It hit the atmosphere with energy estimated to be equivalent to 500,000 tonnes of TNT, sending a shockwave twice around the globe. It caused widespread damage and injured more than 1,000 people. Now though, scientists say there could be many more space rocks like this one on a collision course with the Earth. An international team looked at the last 20 years of data collected from sensors used by the US government and infrasound sensors positioned around the globe. These detectors are in place to detect the threat of nuclear weapons, but they can also capture the blasts caused by asteroid impacts. The researchers found that during this time about 60 asteroids up to 20m in size had smashed into the Earth's atmosphere: far more than was previously thought Most went undetected because they exploded over the ocean or in very remote areas. Prof Brown explained: "We were able to capture the occurrence rate you would expect of things like Chelyabinsk and smaller impacts. When you compare that to the numbers you get from telescopic [observations], our numbers are several times higher." This suggests that the risk from asteroids of this scale has been underestimated. The team estimates that the strike rate of asteroids that are tens of metres in size is between two and 10 times higher than was previously thought. "Something like Chelyabinsk, you would only expect every 150 years on the basis of the telescopic information. But when you look at our data and extrapolate from that, we see that these things seem to be happening every 30 years or so," said Prof Brown. An event such as the Tunguska impact in 1908, where an asteroid flattened thousands of square kilometres of forest in Siberia, would probably happen every few hundred years rather than every few thousand years, he added. Prof Brown said more effort should be made to create early warning systems. "There are literally millions of objects in the tens-of-metres-of-size range that we suspect are near Earth asteroids, that can get close to the Earth," he said. "We have only discovered over 1,000 of these. There are many more of these to find, but it would be very expensive to find all of these and it probably wouldn't make a lot of sense because the atmosphere largely stops them. "But what might make sense are systems that find something a few days or weeks before they hit... to tell you where on the Earth and when they will hit. That would allow some warning to be given to the civil defence authorities." In another study, also published in Nature, scientists believe they have traced the asteroid that the Chelyabinsk meteor splintered off from. They think it is a fragment of a 2km-wide rock called asteroid 86039. Professor Jiri Borovicka, from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, said the orbits were "conspicuously similar", although the team could not prove "the common origin with absolute certainty".

      <title>Autism detectable 'in first months'</title>
      <description>Signs of autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, early research suggests. US researchers analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism had shown diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - in the first few months of life. The findings, reported in Nature, raised hope for early interventions to tackle autism, said a UK expert. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the disease, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <title>Warming gases reach record high</title>
      <description>New data from the World Meteorological Organization says that atmospheric levels of CO2 and methane have broken new records.</description>

      <body>The levels of gases in the atmosphere that drive global warming increased to a record high in 2012. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), atmospheric CO2 grew more rapidly last year than its average rise over the past decade. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide also broke previous records Thanks to carbon dioxide and these other gases, the WMO says the warming effect on our climate has increased by almost a third since 1990. The WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin measures concentrations in the atmosphere, not emissions on the ground. Carbon dioxide is the most important of the gases that they track, but only about half of the CO2 that's emitted by human activities remains in the atmosphere, with the rest being absorbed by the plants, trees, the land and the oceans. Since 1750, global average levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased to 141% of the pre-industrial concentration of 278 parts per million (ppm). According to the WMO there were 393.1ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2012, an increase of 2.2ppm over 2011. This was above the yearly average of 2.02ppm over the past decade. "The observations highlight yet again how heat-trapping gases from human activities have upset the natural balance of our atmosphere and are a major contribution to climate change," said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. "It is a worry. The more we delay action the bigger the risk we cannot stay under the 2 degree Celsius limit that countries have agreed," he said. While the daily measurement of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded the symbolic 400ppm mark in May this year, according to the WMO the global annual average CO2 concentration will cross this point in 2015 or 2016. Levels of methane also reached record highs in 2012 of 1,819 parts per billion. Concentrations have been increasing since 2007 after a period when they appeared to be levelling off. The WMO report says that it is not yet possible to attribute the methane increase to either human activities like cattle breeding and landfills or natural sources such as wetlands. They believe that the rising emissions come from the tropical and mid-latitude northern hemisphere and not from the Arctic, where methane from the melting of permafrost and hydrates has long been a concern. Emissions of nitrous oxide have also grown, with the atmospheric concentration in 2012 at 325.1 parts per billion, 120% above pre-industrial levels. Nitrous oxide gas, although its concentrations are tiny compared to CO2, is 298 times more warming and also plays a role in the destruction of the ozone layer. Recent research indicates that the rate of increase in emissions might be slowing down, but the gases can continue to concentrate in the atmosphere and exert a climate influence for hundreds if not thousands of years. Scientists believe that the new data indicates that global warming will be back with a vengeance, after a slowdown in the rate of temperature increases over the past 14 years. "The laws of physics and chemistry are not negotiable," said Michel Jarraud. "Greenhouse gases are what they are, the laws of physics show they can only contribute to warming the system, but parts of this heat may go in different places like the oceans for some periods of time," he said. This view was echoed by Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. "For the past decade or so the oceans have been sucking up this extra heat, meaning that surface temperatures have only increased slowly. "Don't expect this state of affairs to continue though, the extra heat will eventually come out and bite us, so expect strong warming over the coming decades." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Green spaces 'can save NHS billions'</title>
      <description>Woodland Trust chief says increasing people's access to green spaces can cut billions of pounds from the NHS healthcare bill.</description>

      <body>The Woodland Trust's chief executive has said increasing people's access to green spaces could cut billions of pounds from the NHS healthcare bill. Sue Holden said it had been calculated that the NHS could save £2.1bn a year if everyone had access to green spaces. She made the comments at an event to mark the culmination of the five-year Visit Woods project. Ms Holden added that only an estimated 14% of the UK's population had "easy access to trees". She told an audience of invited guests at the Houses of Parliament that the link between "healthy woods and healthy lives" was a "connection that really has to be made much more and much more often". She added: "It is a connection that we know intrinsically, we believe it to be true but - increasingly - it is something that evidence is backing up as well. "It has been calculated, for example, that £2.1bn of healthcare costs could be saved if everyone had access to green spaces." But she added that just 14% of people in England had access to woodlands within 500m of their home. One of the invited speakers, planning minister Nick Boles, said he was keen for people not to just think in a "defensive way about woodlands". He explained: "Although it is important to think about how we preserve what we have inherited, but we must also think about how we create something new, how do we make sure that our burgeoning population in new cities and suburbs are able to enjoy little slices of woodland like so many of us have done. "Just because something is not 400 years old does not mean it does not have value because in 200 years' time, they will thank us just as we thank those who went before us and planted those woods." The Visit Woods project, funded by Natural England, is an online database of 11,500 woodlands around the UK open to the public. The website, hosted by the Woodland Trust, also listed details of woods owned by the likes of the Forestry Commission, National Trust, RSPB, Wildlife Trusts, councils, organisations and individual landowners. During the event, hosted by Conservative MP Charles Walker, case studies were presented that, organisers said, highlighted the link between green spaces and peoples' wellbeing. These included obesity, mental health, dementia and autism. The role that green spaces and woodlands can play in improving people's wellbeing has been the focus of a growing body of research. A study published earlier this year suggested that urban green spaces did improve people's wellbeing and quality of life. Researchers from the University of Exeter, using data from 5,000 households over 17 years, found that people reported lower levels of mental distress and higher degrees of life satisfaction when they were living in greener areas. Researchers agree that the body of evidence is sufficient for urban planners to factor in the benefits derived from green spaces when designing new developments. Other research has included identifying a link between the lack of regular contact with the rural and natural environment and an increase in the number of cases of allergies and asthma. In Japan, the health benefits of spending time in forests has its own word, shinrinyoku, which means "forest bathing". The disconnection of an increasingly urbanised society with the natural world has been described as "nature-deficit disorder". The phrase, coined by Richard Louv, US author of Last Child in the Wood, primarily focuses on how the current generation of children's contact and understanding of nature has "changed radically" from their parents' and grandparents' experiences. A 2009 report by Natural England found that only 10% of children played in woodlands, compared with 40% of their parents' generation. A joint event this week organised by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce and the Field Studies Council hosted a discussion entitled Reaching into the Outside. It aimed to address concerns that future conservation efforts were at risk as the world became increasingly disconnected with the natural environment outside their doors. The Woodland Trust's head of government affairs, James Cooper, said there was a "need to act on the progress made by VisitWoods and… improve people's access to woodlands, such as encouraging health professionals to make better use of woodlands as a resource". He told BBC News: "What the project has shown is that by providing knowledge, you can unlock the potential of woodlands for people that live nearby. "From a policy point of view, one of the key things is that it shows the ability of trees and woodlands to deliver on a range of government agendas beyond the obvious. "We would want to see better joined up working between health, environment and planning agendas." </body>

      <title>Arafat 'may have been poisoned'</title>
      <description>Late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with radioactive polonium, says a Swiss forensic report obtained by al-Jazeera.</description>

      <body>The late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with radioactive polonium, says a Swiss forensic report obtained by al-Jazeera. Arafat's official medical records say he died in 2004 from a stroke resulting from a blood disorder. But his body was exhumed last year amid continuing claims he was murdered. The Swiss report said tests on the body showed "unexpected high activity" of polonium, which "moderately" supported the poisoning theory. Many Palestinians have long believed that Israel poisoned Arafat. There have also been allegations that he had Aids or cancer. Israel has consistently denied any involvement. A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said the Swiss investigation was "more soap opera than science". The scientists - from the Vaudois University Hospital Centre (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland - carried out a detailed examination of Arafat's medical records, samples taken from his remains and items he had taken into the hospital in Paris where he died in 2004. The biological materials included pieces of Mr Arafat's bones and soil samples from around his corpse. The scientists concluded that their results "moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210". The scientists stressed that they had been unable to reach a more definitive conclusion because of the time that had lapsed since Arafat's death, the limited samples available and the confused "chain of custody" of some of the specimens. Polonium-210 is a highly radioactive substance. It is found naturally in low doses in food and in the body, but can be fatal if ingested in high doses. The scientists have made "a pretty strong statement", according to Prof Paddy Regan, an expert in radiation detection and measurement at the University of Surrey in the UK, who was not involved in the investigation. "They are saying the hypothesis that Arafat was poisoned with polonium-210 is valid and has not been disproven by the data. However they cannot say definitively that he was murdered." Prof Regan says a series of assumptions would have been made in order to ascertain how much Po-210 may or may not have been in Mr Arafat's body at the time of his death. Po-210 has a short half-life of about 138 days. Prof Regan said measuring the tiny fraction left and extrapolating it back to the time of Arafat's death was like a blind man holding the tail of an elephant and using the information to work out the size of the animal. The second problem, he said, was that Po-210 occurs naturally in the environment. However, an indicator that the polonium may be synthetic is if there was far less Pb-210 (lead-210) in the samples. The professor highlighted results from two samples - the shroud under the corpse of Mr Arafat and urine samples taken from his underwear - both showed high levels of Po-210 compared to Pb-210, possibly suggesting the presence of "additional" synthetic polonium. He noted however that most of the samples of polonium measured in the report were accompanied by activities from Pb-210. Parallel investigations are being carried out by French and Russian experts - one Russian official said last month that no traces of polonium had been found. Yigal Palmor of Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC: "This is more soap opera than science." He said the investigations had been commissioned by "interested parties" - Mr Arafat's widow and the Palestinian Authority - and had "never bothered" to look for some key data. "The other huge hole in the theory is the absence of all access to the French hospital where Arafat died and to Arafat's medical files," said Mr Palmor. "How can the cause of death be determined without the opinion of the doctors or the results of the medical tests they ran on the patient? "Israel doesn't feel concerned in the least." Speaking in Paris, Arafat's widow, Suha, said the Swiss results revealed "a real crime, a political assassination". "This has confirmed all our doubts. It is scientifically proved that he didn't die a natural death and we have scientific proof that this man was killed." Reuters said she did not name any suspects and acknowledged that her husband had had many enemies in his lifetime. Arafat, who led the Palestine Liberation Organisation for 35 years and became the first president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996, fell violently ill in October 2004 at his compound. Two weeks later he was flown to a French military hospital in Paris, where he died on 11 November 2004, aged 75. France began a murder inquiry in August 2012 after the Lausanne scientists, working with an al-Jazeera documentary crew, found traces of polonium-210 on Arafat's personal effects. His widow had objected to a post-mortem at the time of his death, but asked the Palestinian Authority to permit the exhumation "to reveal the truth". His remains were removed from his tomb in the West Bank city of Ramallah in November 2012 and reinterred the same day. Last month, the head of the Russian Federal Medico-Biological Agency, Vladimir Uiba, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Arafat "could not have been poisoned with polonium", saying that test carried out by Russian experts "found no traces of this substance". However, the agency later denied that Mr Uiba had made any official statement on the findings. The head of the Palestinian investigation team, Tawfiq Tirawi, confirmed on Tuesday that the Russian and Swiss reports had been delivered. The Palestinian team is reported to have handed over its findings on Saturday. </body>

      <title>Hinkley firm denies fuel claim</title>

      <body>The company building Britain's first nuclear power station in a generation has denied a suggestion that the new plant would use controversial MOX fuel. French state-owned utility EDF said the use of plutonium-based Mixed Oxide fuel was not under consideration for use at the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Under questioning by the Public Accounts Committee, Mark Higson from the Office for Nuclear Development, said MOX could be used. Mr Higson was speaking on 4 November. The OND chief executive told the committee that MOX fuel could be used "in power stations yet to be built. The EPR reactor at Hinkley, for example". MOX is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material. It often consists of plutonium along with uranium, from either natural, reprocessed or depleted sources. EDF, which wants to use French reactor technology backed by Chinese money at Hinkley, responded quickly to the statement, saying it was not correct and that using MOX was not even a consideration. In a statement, an EDF spokesman said: "We have not used MOX in any of our stations and have no plans to do so in the future in our existing stations or new nuclear stations." Mixed oxide fuel was contrived as a method of getting rid of Britain's stockpile of civil plutonium - the largest in the world - accumulated from years of reprocessing foreign and UK nuclear waste. But there is no active plan to dispose of the material, which is now seen as a terrorism target and a proliferation risk because it can be used to make nuclear bombs. Turning plutonium into MOX fuel was thought to be the answer. But the Sellafied MOX plant built to make it failed dramatically at a cost of £1.4bn and was closed in 2011. A planned new MOX facility has a price tag of between £5bn and £6bn to the taxpayer. But the business case is controversial. To the astonishment of MPs on the committee, Mr Higson explained: "The value of the fuel, we would expect to be less than the cost of operating and building the MOX plant." In other words, it would be done purely to dispose of the plutonium, with no certain market for the fuel. EDF says it won't use MOX and Horizon, the other major nuclear company hoping to build reactors in the UK, which is backed by the Japanese firm Hitachi, said it has no plans to use MOX either. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, commented: "MOX is a nuclear fuel invented by governments to address the embarrassing problem of what to do with separated plutonium. It is expensive, difficult to handle and increases maintenance and storage costs, so utilities will always be very reluctant to use MOX unless forced to do so." A spokesman for Decc said the government's preferred option for dealing with plutonium remained MOX, but it appeared to row back on the statement made to MPs. "Mr Higson's reference to Hinkley was merely by way of example. The EPR is capable of burning MOX fuel. Actual use of MOX in Hinkley or any other new build reactors would need to be subject to commercial negotiations with operators concerned. Such commercial negotiations are naturally some way off as the reactors have yet to be built." The spokesman added that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority was also looking at alternative options. Hinkley is already controversial. Peter Atherton of the city firm Liberum Capital called it "the most expensive power station in the world (excluding hydro schemes)". Criticism has focused on the government decision to allow EDF to charge £92.50 per Megawatt-hour (MWh), twice the current market rate for the electricity which, because it is index linked, would be nearer £121 per MWh by the time the plant opens. That could earn the French and Chinese state-owned firms up to £80bn over the life of the plant. A controversy over MOX fuel could be the last thing they need. </body>

      <title>Forbidden City rocks carried on ice</title>
      <description>The huge stones that make up China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says.</description>

      <body>Huge stones that make up parts of China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says. That's despite the fact that wheeled vehicles had been developed 3,000 years earlier. The colossal city was built in the 15th Century by workers at the start of the Ming dynasty. Writing in PNAS journal, the team says that wood-on-ice sliding was more reliable than using wheels. Using sledges on ice was much more expensive and needed more workers but it was deemed a safer method than mule-powered transport. Howard Stone, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, said that on his first tour of the Forbidden City, he and colleagues were curious about how some of the huge stones had been transported. "There's a story on a sign that comments about an ice pack, so we started to investigate it," he told BBC News. "The funny thing about that sign is if you go to the leading scholarship on the science and technology of China, they don't indicate this as far as we can tell. "Most scholarly work indicates that the Chinese had the wheel in 1500 BC and the conclusion from that was they didn't have any need for sledges dragged by man. The Forbidden City was built 3,000 years later, so you have a contradiction. "So our suggestion is somehow that they didn't recognise the use of the artificial ice paths to drag these large rock carvings." But when the team translated a 500-year-old document from the historical record, they found a mention of huge stone carvings transported on ice. They then made calculations looking at the friction of ice to see how plausible it would be to drag such large rocks over the short time period in winter, when it was cold enough to do so. Prof Stone said several hundred workers would have been needed to transport stones ranging from 100-300 tonnes. "If you look at the frictional characteristics of ice for the rocks of this size, we estimate that 300 people were needed for this kind of dragging," he explained. Advance planning was also vital, as water had to be laid out in the winter months so it could freeze along the 43-mile (70km) stretch from a quarry outside Beijing. "They would dig wells every kilometre, pour water on the road which would give it a very smooth surface, The ice can support a lot of weight, they were then able to drag these objects," said Prof Stone. Other researchers say they were already aware of the use of ice to transport marble stone, but it had never been published in academic literature. Sally Church, from the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge University, had noticed the use of this method of moving marble after translating a Chinese book in 2007 called Stories of the Forbidden City. It was written in 1962, but based on earlier sources. The text said: "Really huge stones were moved on a contraption called a 'dry ship' or 'land ship'. Large pieces of wood were put together into a raft-like object, and there were two of these. "In very cold weather they poured water onto the roads and let it freeze, then either they or animals would pull it along." Dr Church said that it was "certainly new" and interesting to look at this topic from an engineering perspective. "It is just a small fact that lies buried in the sources in the subject. I would compare it to something like our knowing that the Tower of London once kept elephants and other exotic animals in a sort of zoo," she told BBC News. </body>

      <title>One in five suns has habitable world</title>
      <description>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet. Using data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope, they argue that one in five stars like the Sun hosts an Earth-sized world located in the "habitable zone". This zone is the region around a star where temperatures allow for water - a key ingredient for life - to stay liquid at the surface. The researchers have published details in the journal PNAS. "What this means is, when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest Sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye," said co-author Erik Petigura, from the University of California, Berkeley. He added: "That is amazing." His UC Berkeley colleague Andrew Howard said the discovery showed that planets like our own were relatively common throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Last week, astronomers announced the discovery of an Earth-sized, rocky planet orbiting its star at a hundredth of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Temperatures on this world would reach between 2,000C and 2,800C, with much of the dayside molten, meaning there would be little chance for life here. But team members cautioned that even finding Earth-sized planets in the habitable - or "Goldilocks" - zones of their stars was no guarantee these worlds would be hospitable to life. "Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive," said another author, Geoff Marcy, professor of astronomy at Berkeley. But Prof Marcy added: "Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbour liquid water suitable for living organisms. "We don't know what range of planet types and their environments are suitable for life." Researchers had previously combed through some 42,000 stars and discovered 600 likely planets. Of these, 10 were both Earth-sized and located at a distance that was just right for liquid water to persist on the surface. However, the team then corrected for planets that might have been missed by software designed to sift through the Kepler data for planet signatures. This process involved introducing fake planets into the data. Accounting for these missed worlds, as well as the fact that only a small fraction of planets are oriented so that they cross in front of their host star as seen from Earth, the astronomers were able to estimate that 22% of all Sun-like stars in the Milky Way have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. "For Nasa, this number - that every fifth star has a planet somewhat like Earth - is really important, because successor missions to Kepler will try to take an actual picture of a planet, and the size of the telescope they have to build depends on how close the nearest Earth-size planets are," Andrew Howard said. "An abundance of planets orbiting nearby stars simplifies such follow-up missions." </body>

      <title>Physics probes 'splashback' problem</title>
      <description>Scientists have studied the fluid dynamics of urine "splashback", with hygiene implications for men and women.</description>

      <body>US physicists have studied the fluid dynamics of urine "splashback" - and found tips to help men and women with their accuracy and hygiene. Using high-speed cameras, the team filmed jets of liquid striking toilet walls and studied the resulting spray. Splashback was low when the jets were used close up with a narrow "angle of attack", said the Brigham Young University team. They will present their research at an American Physical Society meeting. "In response to harsh and repeated criticisms from our mothers and several failed relationships with women, we present the splash dynamics of a simulated human male urine stream," reads their conference abstract. But there is a more serious side to the research. The work is led by Prof Tadd Truscott and Randy Hurd of the "Splash Lab" at Brigham Young in Provo, Utah, who jokingly refer to themselves as "wizz kids". "People ask me, are you serious? I tell them yes, this may involve 12-year-old humour, but it's also a real problem," Prof Truscott told BBC News. "We've all been in disgusting toilets with puddles on the floor - these places are a breeding ground for bacteria." For example, the detergents used to clean hospital toilets could actually increase the spray of disease-causing bacteria, by reducing the surface tension of water, according to a recent study. One might think the physics of aiming urination had already been summarised by the formula: "get it all in the bowl". But micturation is still a messier business than it needs to be, according to the research. Taking measurements live "in the field" did not appeal to the scientists, so the duo built a urination simulator. The "Water Angle Navigation Guide" is a five-gallon bucket with hoses connected to two types of synthetic urethra. The team fired coloured water at various target "toilets" at the velocity and pressure of average human urination. Then, using a high-speed camera, they captured the moment of impact in remarkable visual detail. Splashback was heightened by a phenomenon known as Plateau-Rayleigh instability, where a falling stream of liquid breaks up into droplets. "The male urine stream breaks up about 6-7 inches outside the urethra exit," Mr Hurd explained. "So by the time it hits the urinal, it's already in droplet form. And these droplets are the perpetrators of the splash formation on your khaki pants." His advice? "The closer you are, the better. If you can get stream impact with the porcelain, it's a lot less chaotic." Of course, in a domestic bathroom, distance from the toilet is governed chiefly by one variable: "to stand or sit". "People are always arguing over which is better. Because when you sit close, you're also closer to getting wet," said Prof Truscott. "In Germany there is a derogatory term 'sitzpinkler' for a man who sits down to pee. It means he's kind of a wuss. "So we wanted to look at whether sitting down is really effective. What are the splash differences?" To compare the two positions, the scientists gave rulers to their friends and sent them into the toilet. "It turns out you are five times as far away when you stand up - and that's a pretty significant difference in impact velocity for those droplets of urine," said Mr Hurd. Impact with the toilet water is captured in a video by the team. "You can see the droplets create a large cavity in the water, which then collapses, causing even greater splashback. The amount of splash is considerable," Mr Hurd explained. "It seems that sitting down is the best sure-fire way to avoid unwanted splashing in a traditional toilet." Above all, he says, "the biggest thing you can do" to reduce splashback - sitting or standing - is to alter the "angle of attack". Aiming directly at a vertical urinal wall - a 90 degree angle - causes a nasty kickback, as does aiming directly at the toilet water. "Narrowing the angle really helps," said Mr Hurd. For a typical urinal, "best practice" means standing slightly to one side, and aiming downwards at a low angle of impact. "This way you take advantage of both splash-reduction techniques," Hurd explains. Prof Truscott encourages men and women to "be artistic" with their aim and find an angle to suit the particular facility they are faced with. The designs of public toilets and home bathrooms does not always help us achieve 100% efficiency, he said. "Most surfaces you pee into, such as porcelain, are hydrophilic, which is a disadvantage. The water spreads across them, creating a puddle to splash into," said Mr Hurd. He believes that hydrophobic coatings will ultimately make toilets more hygienic, with important benefits for hospitals, schools, and workplaces. The Brigham-Young team has been "inundated" with commercial products to reduce spray - such as fabric inserts, urinals with triangular fins, and toilet bowls with unusually sloping angles. "Some work fantastically - others really don't work at all. It's almost worse than nothing," says Truscott. "My favourite is painting a fly on the wall to indicate where you should aim. Unfortunately, some companies put that fly in the wrong place." Sega has even developed a "Toylet" urinal game, installed in Tokyo Metro stations to award men points for accuracy. But Prof Truscott says one of the most effective tricks is also the simplest - drop a few pieces of tissue into a toilet bowl to soften the blow. The Splash Lab team plans to investigate further toilet designs and find "the optimal approach for urinal usage", removing some of the obstacles between men, women and bathroom harmony. </body>

      <title>Concept car ditches steering wheel</title>

      <body>Toyota has suggested motorists of the future could ride about in a vehicle inspired by a horse. It has announced a concept car that drivers would control by shifting their body weight while standing, doing away with the need for a steering wheel. One analyst said the current design posed too many safety issues, but did point towards future developments. The FV2 vehicle will make its official debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in two weeks' time. Toyota suggested leaning forwards, backwards or to the side to determine the FV2's direction would be "intuitive", adding that voice and facial recognition sensors would bring up information to assist users in their journeys. Suggested destinations and other data would be shown on an augmented reality display presented on the windscreen, it said. The aim was to develop aspects of trust and understanding between the vehicle and the rider "similar to those a rider will have with a horse". "This is an imagination piece rather than something that will be seen in production in the next few years," a spokesman told the BBC. "But some of the technologies we're suggesting could be introduced further down the line - say in five to 10 years' time." Carmakers often release images and models of imagined futuristic vehicles to coincide with motor shows. Although they are sometimes little more than a publicity stunt, they can be valuable as a way of seeking early feedback and helping determine where research and development funds should be invested. It can still take a long time for successful ideas to come to fruition. For example, Toyota first showed off the idea of making a hybrid - combining both an internal combustion engine and an electrical propulsion system - in 1977 when it unveiled a special version of its Sports 800 GT at the Tokyo show. It was 20 years later that it released its first hybrid for sale to the public - the Prius - in Japan. Other examples of tech first seen in concept vehicles include panoramic glass roofs, now found in some Renault and Mercedes cars among others, and using touchscreen panels to do away with dashboard buttons, as is the case in Tesla's Model S. One expert said the Toyota's latest design was intended to address a problem worrying the industry at large. "Lots of carmakers are very frightened by the fact many young people can't afford a car and insurance, and the whole concept of a traditional motor vehicle doesn't really appeal to them," said Paul Newton from the consultants IHS Automotive. "I think in practical terms the FV2 won't see the light of day - if you are standing up and leaning to move it, my first thought would be, what if you hit something? The likelihood of it being licensed in today's safety-conscious environment is zero. "But concepts are the proving ground for lots of technologies that do come into mainstream production, and many things will happen in the next 25 years that will redefine what we've probably spent a good part of century looking at as the norm." Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Honda are among the other firms who have announced they will be unveiling concept vehicles at the Tokyo Motor Show, which runs from 22 November to 1 December. </body>

      <body>India has successfully launched a spacecraft to the Red Planet - with the aim of becoming the fourth space agency to reach Mars. The Mars Orbiter Mission took off at 09:08 GMT from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the country's east coast. The head of India's space agency told the BBC the mission would demonstrate the technological capability to reach Mars orbit and carry out experiments. The spacecraft is set to travel for 300 days, reaching Mars orbit in 2014. If the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the US, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. In order for the MOM to embark on the right trajectory for its 300-day, 780-million km journey, it must carry out its final orbital burn by 30 November. Some observers are viewing the launch of the MOM, also known by the informal name of Mangalyaan (Mars-craft), as the latest salvo in a burgeoning space race between the Asian powers of India, China, Japan, South Korea and others. Prof Andrew Coates, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, told BBC News: "I think this mission really brings India to the table of international space exploration. Interplanetary exploration is certainly not trivial to do, and [India] has found some interesting scientific niches to make some measurements in." Those niche areas include searching for the signature of methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere, which has previously been detected from Martian orbit and telescopes on Earth. However, Nasa's Curiosity rover recently failed to find the gas in its measurements of atmospheric gases. CH4 has a short lifetime in the Martian atmosphere, meaning that some source on the Red Planet must replenish it. Intriguingly, some 95% of atmospheric methane on Earth is produced by microbes, which has led some to propose the possibility of a biosphere deep beneath the Martian surface. But the gas can be produced by geological processes too, most notably by volcanism. Definitive conclusions are likely to be elusive, but the spacecraft's Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) instrument will aim to make measurements and map any potential sources of methane "plumes". The spacecraft will also examine the rate of loss of atmospheric gases to outer space. This could provide insights into the planet's history; billions of years ago, the envelope of gases around Mars is thought to have been more substantial. At $72m (£45m), the mission is comparatively cheap, but some commentators have still questioned whether a country with one of the highest rankings for childhood malnutrition in the world should be spending millions on a mission to the Red Planet. In one sense, India was left in a quandary because of the failure of its most powerful launcher, the first choice to loft the MOM into orbit. It meant the country's space agency could no longer fire the satellite directly out of Earth's atmosphere. As a fuel-saving alternative, the spacecraft will circle Earth in an elliptical orbit for nearly a month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. The formal name for the route MOM will take to Mars is a "Hohmann Transfer Orbit". The spacecraft takes advantage of a favourable planetary alignment, carrying out six small engine burns over November to lift it to a higher orbit before a final burn sends it off on an interplanetary trajectory. The difficulty of visiting the Red Planet will not be lost on Indian officials; just under half the total attempts to reach Mars have succeeded. But Prof Coates said the planned mechanics for getting to Mars were on a sound footing, and that the probe stood a good chance as long as its engines fired correctly. Those who defend India's current direction in space exploration say the technological development required to mount this mission could indirectly benefit the country's other activities, including poverty reduction. Nisha Agrawal, chief executive of Oxfam in India, told the BBC: "India is home to poor people but it's also an emerging economy, it's a middle-income country, it's a member of the G20. What is hard for people to get their head around is that we are home to poverty but also a global power. "We are not really one country but two in one. And we need to do both things: contribute to global knowledge as well as take care of poor people at home." K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told the BBC's India Business Report: "Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: 'It is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society.' He added: "A great revolution has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme." Mr Radhakrishnan played down talk of a race between China and India in space, commenting: "We are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services." But a successful launch would allow India to surge ahead of regional rival China, at least in the exploration of Mars. China's Yinghuo-1 spacecraft was to have reached Martian orbit in late 2012. But it was piggybacked on the Russian Phobos Grunt spacecraft, which became stranded in low-Earth orbit shortly after launch in November 2011. The MOM was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to postpone lift-off. </body>

      <body>A rare solar eclipse allowing a view of the Sun that is totally or partially blocked by the Moon has taken place. It was first visible in the southern United States, before sweeping east across the Atlantic Ocean and the African continent. The US space agency, Nasa, said the greatest total eclipse occurred over the Atlantic Ocean. One of the best views was in northern Kenya, where tour companies organised trips to view a total blackout. Local myths there attribute the event to the Moon eating the Sun. Partial views were available in eastern North America and southern Europe. This solar eclipse was a rare occurrence in that it was "hybrid" - switching between an annular and total eclipse. In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the sun, while an annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is at its farthest from the Earth and does not block out the Sun completely, leaving a halo of sunlight still visible around the Moon. The eclipse event began about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Jacksonville, Florida with an annular eclipse visible for four seconds at sunrise. As the Moon's shadow raced east the eclipse switched from annular to total along a narrow corridor. The greatest total eclipse occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 330km south-west of Liberia, and lasted for more than one minute. The eclipse continued across Africa through the Congos until it passed through northern Uganda and northern Kenya, ending in southern Ethiopia and Somalia. Either side, a partial eclipse was seen within a much broader path including eastern North America, northern South America, southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Experts warned that no-one should attempt to view the Sun with the naked eye. A safe view of eclipses can be obtained by using special welder's glasses or a pinhole camera. </body>

      <title>US to build hypersonic spy plane</title>
      <description>The US has revealed plans to develop a robot spy plane that is designed to fly at six times the speed of sound.</description>

      <body>Lockheed Martin has begun work on a successor to the supersonic Blackbird SR-71 spy plane. The unmanned SR-72 will use an engine that combines a turbine and a ramjet to reach its top speed of Mach 6 - about 3,600mph (5,800km/h). Like its predecessor, the SR-72 will be designed for high-altitude surveillance but might also be fitted with weapons to strike targets. Lockheed said the aircraft should be operational by 2030. The SR-72 is being developed at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works RandD centre in California that designed and built the original Blackbird. That aircraft first flew in 1964 and was a mainstay of US Air Force spying and surveillance work until 1998. It typically flew at altitudes of 24,000m (80,000ft) and could reach speeds of Mach 3. In a blogpost about the SR-72, Lockheed Martin said the aircraft would operate at similar altitudes but would fly far faster. At Mach 6 the plane could travel the 3,500 miles (5,500km) from New York to London in less than an hour. While spy satellites can photograph enemy territory, the relatively long time it takes for them to be moved to a new orbit so they pass over a target can limit their usefulness. By contrast, wrote Lockheed Martin, the SR-72 "would be so fast, an adversary would have no time to react or hide". For the SR-72, Lockheed Martin is drawing on work done on the Falcon HTV-2 hypersonic technology vehicle. This is a test-bed for the futuristic technologies needed to support safe hypersonic flight and cope with the extreme conditions encountered by any object flying at such a speed. For instance, on one test flight of the HTV-2, the aircraft hit a top speed of Mach 20 and its flight surfaces reached 1,927C (3,500F). To reach Mach 6, the SR-72 will use an engine that acts like a normal jet turbine until speeds of Mach 3 are reached but which then operates like a ramjet to accelerate beyond that. "Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades," said Brad Leland, Lockheed Martin's hypersonic programme manager on the blog. "The technology would be a game-changer in theatre, similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today." </body>

      <title>Down's pregnancy blood test trialled</title>
      <description>A blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS.</description>

      <body>A simple blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS. It could significantly reduce the number of women needing invasive testing, which can cause miscarriage. The study at Great Ormond Street Hospital will assess how and when the blood test could be introduced across the NHS. In the UK, 750 babies are born with Down's syndrome each year. All pregnant women in the UK are offered screening for Down's syndrome. Currently a woman's risk is assessed, based on her age, an ultrasound scan and markers in the blood. Those deemed at high risk of a child with Down's are offered an invasive test. It involves using a needle to take a sample of either placental cells or of the fluid that bathes the baby - but this procedure carries a one-in-100 chance of miscarriage. The aim is to reduce the number of women having the invasive testing by more accurately assessing the risk. The new blood test, which is already available privately, looks for tiny fragments of DNA from the placenta and the foetus floating in the mother's bloodstream. Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of a massive stretch of DNA - a part or even all of chromosome 21. The test can analyse the free floating DNA for extra copies. It is thought to be 99% accurate. Those with a positive result will still be offered the invasive procedure to confirm the result. Prof Lyn Chitty, from Great Ormond Street who is leading the trial, told the BBC: "It could very significantly reduce the number of invasive tests and increase detection, this is seriously exciting stuff and it would be great to get it into the NHS. "What we are trying to do is give information on how and when to introduce it into the NHS." The NHS National Institute for Health Research funded trial will analyse the scale of the benefit and the best way to inform mothers and train staff, including midwives, about the test. "One of the very important aspects of our study is looking at ways to ensure women understand the test and the implications of the results so that they can choose whether or not to have it," she said. Dr Anne Mackie, from the UK National Screening Committee, said: "Early indications suggest that using Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) to screen women who are found to be at a higher risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome would enable earlier and safer detection of the condition. "[We have] been working in close collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, particularly in looking to ensure the new test does not affect the quality of the current service offered to pregnant women." Carol Boys, the chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association said: "We would be delighted if tests which lead to miscarriage were discontinued. "We understand that the new test is approximately 99% accurate for those women who have already been established as having a high chance of carrying a baby with Down's syndrome, and are interested to see if that accuracy is maintained in women where this has not already been established. The studies for this are still under way." She said the information and education provided to women and health professionals would be important. </body>

      <title>Earth-sized 'lava world' discovered</title>
      <description>A scorching "lava world" with a similar mass and density to that of Earth has been discovered orbiting a star 400 light-years away.</description>

      <body>A doomed "lava world" with a similar mass and density to that of Earth has been discovered orbiting a star 400 light-years away. Observations suggest the planet, named Kepler 78b, is composed mostly of rock and iron, much like our own planet. But its extremely close proximity to its host star - a hundredth of the distance between the Earth and the Sun - remains something of a puzzle. Details of the work by two teams of researchers appear in Nature journal. From theory, astronomers expect the planet to be tidally locked to its host star, which means that one side is permanently facing in, and the other side permanently facing away. Temperatures on Kepler 78b's "dayside" - the side of the planet facing its star - are a searing 2,000C-2,800C, far too hot to support life. "I think it's safe to say that the surface on the 'dayside' is molten," Josh Winn, associate professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), told BBC News. But he added: "Nobody has really calculated whether or not we expect the 'nightside' to be molten (we do not know the temperature of the nightside), nor how far down the molten layer is expected to go within the planet." The hot Earth-twin belongs to a new class of "ultrashort period" planets recently identified by the now-defunct Kepler space telescope. These newfound worlds all complete one circuit of their host star in less than 12 hours. But according to current theories of planet formation, Kepler 78b could not have formed so close to its star, nor could it have moved there. Dimitar Sasselov, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, an author on one of the Nature papers, said: "Kepler 78b is going to end up in the star very soon, astronomically speaking. "It couldn't have formed in place because you can't form a planet inside a star. It couldn't have formed further out and migrated inward, because it would have migrated all the way into the star. This planet is an enigma." Kepler 78b's orbit and size have been determined by analysing the light given off by the star as the planet transits, or passes in front as viewed from Earth. The researchers detected a transit each time the star's light dipped, and measured this dimming to determine the planet's size. This was possible because the bigger an exoplanet is, the more light it blocks. But measuring the planet's mass involved tracking the motion of the star itself. Depending on its mass, a planet can exert a gravitational tug on its star. This stellar motion can be detected as a very slight wobble, known as a Doppler shift. The results suggest Kepler 78b is about 1.2 times the size of Earth, and 1.7 times as massive. From the same measurements, the astronomers calculated the planet's density as 5.3 grams per cubic centimetre, close to the 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre value for Earth. These results provide strong evidence for Kepler 78b's rocky composition. Dr Winn said the fact that two independent teams of scientists came to similar conclusions about the alien world added confidence to the measurement. Kepler-78b is probably a doomed world, researchers explained. Gravitational tides are expected to draw it ever closer to its star. Eventually it will move so close that the star's gravity will rip the planet apart, vanishing within three billion years. Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <title>Farming key to closing emissions gap</title>
      <description>A new study suggests that simple changes to agriculture could play a significant role in plans to cut global greenhouse emissions by 2020.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24817837</url>

      <body>Changing farming practices could play an important role in averting dangerous climate change says the UN. In their annual emissions report, they measure the difference between the pledges that countries have made to cut warming gases and the targets required to keep temperatures below 2C. On present trends there is likely to be an annual excess of 8 to 12 gigatonnes of these gases by 2020. Agriculture, they say, could make a significant difference to the gap. This is the fourth such report, compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) in conjunction with 44 scientific groups in 17 countries. It says the world needs to reduce total emissions to 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020 to keep the planet from going above the 2C target, agreed at a UN meeting in Cancun in 2010. But when all the pledges and plans made by countries are added together, they show an excess of between 8 and 12 gigatonnes per annum in seven years time, very similar to last year's report. To put it in context, 12 gigatonnes is about 80% of all the emissions coming from all the power plants in the world right now. The authors highlight a number of ways in which this gap can be closed, including tightening the rules for counting emissions and expanding the scope of pledges already made. They believe around half the gap could be closed in this way. But they say that simple changes in agriculture could cut emissions by four gigatonnes, about two thirds of the remaining difference. Emissions from farming, including nitrous oxide from applying fertiliser and CO2 from ploughing fields accounts for more than 10% of the global total right now. "The potential is enormous," said Dr Joseph Alcamo from the UN Environment Programme. "It's not with anything very exotic, it has to do with the way we apply fertilisers to our fields, it has to do with conservation tillage so you don't plough the fields very rigorously." Conservation tillage includes a number of methods including leaving the previous year's crop residues on the fields to help protect the soils. The UN cited the example of Argentina where 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided by a shift to conservation tillage that took place in the 1990s. They argue that not only would it curb global warming, it would help poor farmers as well. "You could take a big step down the pathway of sustainable agriculture," said Dr Alcamo, "You can unite ideas of sustainable agriculture for the whole world together with ideas of controlling emissions by 2020." The report highlighted a number of other measures that could bridge the looming gap including energy efficiency, greater emphasis on renewables and reform of fossil fuel subsidies. "A lot of these actions have been done not for climate mitigation but to further national and local interest," said Dr Alcamo. The study makes the point that if action on curbing greenhouse gases isn't taken in the short term, then the possibilities of getting emissions down in the future becomes much more difficult. "Remember 44 gigatonnes by 2020 just sets the stage for further cuts that will be needed," said Unep executive director Achim Steiner. "We need 40 gigatonnes by 2025, 35 gigatonnes by 2030 and 22 gigatonnes by 2050. "At the moment the trend is in the opposite direction, we are over 50 gigatonnes." Next week, delegates from all over the world will gather in Warsaw to continue negotiations on a new global climate agreement that is expected to be signed in 2015. According to Mr Steiner, the emissions gap report shows just how much needs to be done. "This report provides a very sobering perspective of where we are and still heading and quite how far- reaching the implications are of maintaining this trajectory." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Coastal retreat plan to curb floods</title>
      <description>The UK's largest ever coastal flood realignment sees a part of the West Sussex coast given back to the sea to increase protection.</description>

      <body>A scheme to combat flooding by surrendering land to the sea will be completed on Monday on the south coast. The £28m "managed realignment" at Medmerry in West Sussex has seen the building of 7km (four miles) of new sea walls up to 2km inland. By letting the waters in, the Environment Agency says the risk of flooding for hundreds of homes will be reduced. The surrendered land will become a wetland habitat for many species. The sea has long been a threatening presence on the flat land of the Manhood Peninsula that juts into the English channel on the coast between Portsmouth and Worthing. Caravan parks in Selsey and Bracklesham Bay have been flooded a number of times in recent years, as the shingle defences have yielded to the surging seas. Since 2011, the Environment Agency have been working on a plan that they believe curbs that threat. The project is billed as the country's largest ever coastal flood realignment scheme, but it has required the destruction of the existing sea wall at Medmerry and giving back to the sea some of the land nearest to the coast. "We have made a hole in the sea wall," the Environment Agency's flood and coastal risk manager, Andrew Gilham, told BBC News on a visit to the site. "But before doing that we've actually built 7km of new defences further inland from the coast. What we've been able to create here is an area that can absorb the energy of the waves and reduce the flood risk to people." Although the new walls are much closer to local communities, the Agency says homes are much better protected as a result, with the development able to withstand a once in a thousand year flood. The change is partly being forced on the Agency because of EU legislation that requires compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat through development. The Medmerry scheme makes up for the loss of similar conservation areas in and around the Solent. "It is not politically driven," said Mr Gilham. "But the benefit of creating the habitat here is not only to reduce flood risk in this area but also to reduce flood risk to communities in Portsmouth and Southampton. "If we weren't able create habitat here we wouldn't be be able to do those defences." The scale of the £28m development is enormous. Between the new earthen walls and the sea stand 183 hectares of land that the Agency says will rapidly become a saltwater marsh, with potentially huge benefits for wildlife in the area. It will be managed by the RSPB. "Even in construction, we're seeing lots of migratory birds using this area," said Andrew Gilham. "It is already starting to be used by the wildlife. It's a massive nature reserve and a massive opportunity on the south coast." Local people are hoping that letting the sea in will not only protect their homes but boost the local economy as well. Alan Chamberlain is the estate manager of the newly renamed Medmerry Park holiday village. His business, located next door to the new habitat, is actually below sea level. "In the past we have been very close to flooding, and now we've got a one-in-one-thousand-year protection, one of the best in the country actually," he told BBC News. "For us it's a win win, it will encourage visitors to the site, birdwatchers and those interested in nature." The new development is facing its first big test on the day it opens as it will see one of the highest tides of the year. But the Environment Agency are fully confident it will pass with flying colours. Medmerry is one of a number of managed realignment projects that the Environment Agency are involved in. Andrew Gilham says it's part of a new approach. "Rather than fighting it, we are working with nature," he explained. "It's an important change in approach, you can only keep building bigger and bigger defences for so long. We have to ask if we can make better use of public money. "Certainly the habitat we are creating here is important to the broader ecosystem and the broader economy of the country by encouraging people to visit remote areas." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>'Platypus-zilla' found in Australia</title>
      <description>Part of a giant platypus fossil, dubbed platypus-zilla, is unearthed in Australia, scientists report.</description>

      <body>Part of a giant platypus fossil has been unearthed in Queensland, Australia. Scientists have dubbed the beast "platypus-zilla" and believe it would have measured more than 1m long (3ft). Writing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the researchers say the creature lived between five and 15 million years ago. The discovery suggests the evolutionary back-story of today's platypus is more complicated than was thought. Prof Mike Archer, from the University of New South Wales, said: "Suddenly up pops 'playtpus-zilla' - this gigantic monstrosity that you would have been afraid to swim with. "It indicates there are branches in the platypus family tree that we hadn't suspected before." Today, all that survives of this platypus is a single fossilised tooth, which was unearthed in the Riversleigh fossil beds in northwest Queensland. Based on its size, the researchers have estimated that the new species (Obdurodon tharalkooschild) would have been at least twice as large as today's platypus. Bumps on its teeth and other fossil finds nearby suggest that the creature feasted on crustaceans, turtles, frogs and fish. Although the area where the molar was found is a desert, millions of years ago it would have been covered in forest. The researchers think the beast would have spent its time in and around freshwater ponds. Prof Archer said that with just one tooth, it was difficult to work out exactly what this species would have looked like. However other fossils suggest that it could have shared the same bizarre appearance as today's platypuses, with their duck-like bills, large webbed feet and poisonous spurs. But this would have been on a much larger scale. "I guess it probably would have looked like a platypus on steroids," said Prof Archer. Fossil platypus finds are in short supply, with just a few fragments found throughout the southern hemisphere. As a result, there are many gaps in our understanding of the creature's past. Prof Archer said: "We have been naively led to suspect that maybe it was just one lineage of strange animals bumbling its way through time and space at least for the last 60 million years. "The discovery of this new one was a bit of a shock to us. It was a wake-up call that the platypus's story, the more we know about it, is increasingly more complicated than we thought." The researchers are now hoping to find more platypus fossils in the same area to try to shed more light these enigmatic Australian animals. Follow Rebecca on Twitter </body>

      <title>Trees help at-risk species keep cool</title>
      <description>Dense tree canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study shows.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24761801</url>

      <body>Forests with dense canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study has shown. Researchers found plants that favoured cooler conditions fared better under dense canopies than in ones that were more open to the elements. They added that these conditions could be a "critical mechanism" in the conservation of forest plant diversity. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A team of international researchers, headed by scientists from Belgium, noted that previous studies had shown that "biological signals of recent global warming" had been increasing across an array of ecosystems. "Around the globe, climate warming is increasing the dominance of warm-adapted species - a process described as 'thermophilisation'," they observed. The team gathered data from vegetation survey from more than 1,400 plots in temperate forests across North America and Europe. In each plot, they compared the results from an original survey with a repeated survey that was, on average, carried out 34.5 years later. The results showed that there had been a sizeable turnover, with about one-third of the species present in the original survey being replaced by other plants. Shaded sanctuary However, they also found that the thermophilisation of vegetation was lowest in forests where canopies had become denser. "These results suggest that recent forest canopy closure in northern hemisphere temperate forests has buffered the impacts of macroclimate warming on ground-layer plant communities, thus slowing changes in community composition," they wrote. As well as lowering temperatures, the dense canopy cover also increased relative air humidity and shade within forests' understorey. The researchers explained that these conditions also offered protection to forest herbs and tree seedlings from summer drought, "decreasing mortality and thus buffering the impacts of large-scale climate change". They noted that in western Europe, a number of factors - such as changes to management regimes - had resulted in increased tree growth and forest densities. "Logging and natural losses of tree biomass have been consistently lower than annual growth increments, resulting in an almost doubling of standing stocks of trees per hectare between 1950 and 2000," they wrote. Temperate forests account for about 16% of the world's tree cover, while understorey plants account for 80% of the flora diversity found in these habitats. Co-author Keith Kirby, a woodland ecologist from the University of Oxford's Department of Plant Sciences, said the microclimate created by a dense forest canopy allowed some plants to remain within their comfort zone. However, he warned: "The other thing we must remember is that this moderating characteristic only works as long as you have got the canopy there. "At some stage, the trees themselves may die from disease, they may get felled or they themselves might succumb to the effects of climate change. "Once that happens, what we might then see is that the ground flora might start to shift quite rapidly, so we might have things keeping relatively stable for quite a while but then we pass a tipping point once the canopy opens up." After a prolonged post-war hiatus, traditional woodland management techniques - such as coppicing - are becoming popular once again. But Dr Kirby told BBC News that this study's findings suggested that a more considered approach might be needed. He observed: "This might be a case to say hold on a minute because if we start coppicing and opening up the canopies, we will also be exposing these plants to future climate change more. "Maybe in the future we should be reducing the extent that we break up canopies." But he added that perhaps "the gentle intervention" of management techniques was needed in order to strengthen woodlands' resilience to the threats posed by pests, pathogens and extreme weather events. </body>

The government has opened a consultation on the priorities for spending nearly £20bn of EU subsidies over the next seven years. The budget has been cut overall and there is huge controversy about how it should be shared between helping farmers and protecting wildlife. The decisions will have an impact on hedgerows, trees, wild flowers, birds, bees, water quality and the appearance of the landscape. An EU settlement in the summer has given individual nations more discretion on how to spend funds. Some countries want to prioritise direct help for farmers, but the UK government says farmers should have to earn their cash as much as possible by working in a way that benefits the environment. Ministers want to divert the maximum amount of 15% into rural development and green schemes. They aim to help hill farmers and to create shelter for pollinators, such as bees and moths. But this has worried big farmers, who they say they will lose out and get less direct payment than some of their European counterparts. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) president, Peter Kendall, said: "English farmers are already significantly disadvantaged in comparison with their near neighbours in the EU." Environmentalists are not happy either. They argue the government's plans have failed to ensure that whole landscapes are farmed in a way that safeguards water quality and the environment. Helen Perkins from the Wildlife Trusts said: "We need to see farming for nature mainstreamed - with environmental standards raised on every farm so that exemplary practices aren't restricted to pockets of the countryside." Campaigners are perplexed that the government has given the public just 28 days to respond to the consultation on an immensely complex reform. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own processes over farm budgets. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin </body>

      <title>'Low health risk' from fracking</title>
      <description>The risks to public health from fracking for shale gas are low, according to a new official report.</description>

      <body>The risks to public health from fracking for shale gas are low, according to a new official report. Any problems publicised so far - such as in the US - are the result of operational failure or poor regulation. The study, by Public Health England, an agency of the Department of Health, reviewed the latest research. It focused on the risks of emissions of the chemicals used in fracking and radioactive material released with the gas. The central conclusion is that "potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction are low if the operations are properly run and regulated". The report recommends environmental monitoring through the lifetime of any project and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracking fluid. The findings have been welcomed by the government which is pressing for the development of shale gas in the UK. Environmental campaigners opposed to fracking say the study highlights the risks and the lack of oversight. So far exploratory fracking has been limited to one site in Lancashire but the British Geological Survey (BGS) estimates UK shale could yield 150 billion cubic metres of gas, so commercial interest is growing. The report draws on American research to conclude that though pollutants can enter the air from gas flaring or leaks, "these emissions are relatively small, intermittent and certainly not unique to shale gas extraction…" One quoted study - from the Barnett Shale in Texas in 2010 - found 70 individual volatile organic compounds including ethane, propane, butane and pentanes close to shale gas activity but observed these to be "localised" and significantly diminished downwind. But the authors recognise that there is relatively little evidence to go on - the only detailed peer reviewed study of the impact of air emissions was published last year by the Colorado School of Public Health. That work found that people living within half-a-mile of gas wells had an elevated risk of health conditions including neurological and respiratory effects. However the Colorado study was criticised for having a small sample size and the Public Health England report says local weather and topography may mean that similar results may not be likely in Britain. The PHE report acknowledges that extracting shale gas could produce residues containing naturally-occurring radioactive materials - but it argues that these risks would be similar to those in the existing oil and gas industry. On the dangers of groundwater being contaminated, the study quotes a 2011 paper by MIT researchers who found that nearly half of 43 pollution incidents were related to drilling operations - mainly because of faulty sealing of wells. According to the PHE study, American experience points to surface spills of chemicals being the most likely to affect water sources. However it points out that 99% of drinking water in England comes from heavily-regulated water companies so the risk is "considered minimal". The remainder who get their water from private wells are "particularly vulnerable" - but "high quality well integrity" should protect water sources. Another risk examined is from the chemicals used in the fracking process. An American study found 75% of them could affect skin, eyes and breathing while 25% are carcinogenic. For that reason, the PHE study calls for full disclosure of the chemicals used and strict enforcement of chemicals handling and of well design. Overall, the study concludes that the well-publicised problems experienced in the US may not be replicated in the UK because of differences in geology, operation and regulation. The energy minister Michael Fallon welcomed the findings. "The UK has the most robust regulatory regime in the world for shale gas and companies will only be granted permission to frack for shale if their operations are safe," he said. However Greenpeace campaigner Leila Deen said the report was a "timely reminder" of the risks of fracking and the potential long-term health impacts. "The government has so far responded to these risks by cutting the budget of the environmental regulator and effectively allowing companies to mark their own homework when it comes to monitoring." </body>

      <body>Two orphaned otter cubs are being cared for by the Scottish SPCA after being found in distress at Thurso beach in Caithness. The 10-week-old males were spotted by a member of the public. They were scared off by two dogs and were eventually found hiding under a wheelie bin in a nearby garden. Scottish SPCA senior inspector Audrey Gunn managed to trap the pair. They are receiving care at the charity's rescue centre in Clackmannanshire. The cubs, found on 26 October, have been named Thurso and Surf. Ms Gunn said: "Thurso and Surf were timid but curious and I paid a visit to the local fish shop to make sure they were well fed. "They were lucky to be found as otters are dependant on their mothers until they're around a year old and they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own." National Wildlife Rescue Centre manager Colin Seddon added: "Both cubs are well, albeit very frightened. However, they are clearly very happy to be together and they follow each other everywhere." </body>

      <title>Badger cull fails to meet target</title>
      <description>Some 940 badgers were killed in total during a pilot cull, which was lower than the planned target, the government admits.</description>

      <body>One of the badger cull pilot schemes failed to meet its target - even after a three-week extension, the government has admitted. The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were "designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers". "I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November," said Mr Paterson. "During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. "This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. "While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane." Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a "complete failure" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' "The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards," said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. "Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. "The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping." Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because "the badgers have moved the goalposts". "By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations," she said. "David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed." </body>

      <body>A wild boar which has been on the loose in Alderney for more than a month is thought to have swum there from the nearby French coast. The boar found its way into a pig farm on Friday but, when approached, escaped by jumping over a 1m (3ft) stock fence. Farm owner Tess Woodnutt said she would not have believed the animal could jump so high from a standing start, if she had not seen it with her own eyes. Islanders have dubbed the boar "ghost pig", as it has only been seen at dusk. Mrs Woodnutt said she first became aware of the boar on 27 September, when she was on holiday and received a call from a fellow islander saying one of their 40 pigs had escaped. Her son Jake immediately went to the farm and soon established no pigs were missing. Steve Shaw, who was Alderney harbour master for 25 years, said he did not believe it would be possible for a wild boar to get to the island by boat without the crew noticing, and he had never heard of a wild boar being found on any vessel. Some islanders have speculated the animal could be an "iron age pig", which have been farmed on the island. However, Alan Woodnutt, Tess's husband, said he was certain it was not. "Iron age pigs are a cross between a wild boar and a Tamworth," he said. "They look a bit like a wild boar but this animal was not the progeny of an iron age pig." Mrs Woodnutt said the boar's arrival on the island was a mystery but she had had it confirmed to her by an expert in the UK that a wild boar could swim long distances in open water. Wild boar are commonly found in Normandy, the coast of which lies seven miles (11km) to the east of Alderney. Duty Insp Kieran McGrath from Guernsey Police said islanders should contact them if they spotted the animal and should not approach it themselves, as any wild boar could be dangerous when cornered. </body>

      <body>Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood, in a study published in the journal Current Biology. Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish. But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences. Dr John Bradshaw of Bristol University, an expert in anthrozoology, told the BBC's Sarah Montague: "We now know that dogs are reading each others' body language". "I'm sure dogs teach each other things," added novelist and dog lover Jilly Cooper, as she reflected on the way her dogs copied each other in "racing around the lawn".

      <body>More than four decades ago the golden eagle was awarded the same protections under US law as the country's national bird, the bald eagle. Even disturbing their nests is a criminal offence. The raptor is not considered to be under threat but scientists are worried about a recent increase in the number of golden eagles killed by wind turbines. Eagles in flight tend to focus on the ground below as they look for prey, unaware of the fast-spinning blades in their paths until it's too late. The wind energy industry says such deaths account for a tiny percentage of human-caused deaths of eagles. It says it is working with the government to help protect birds. The BBC spent a day with a scientists from the US Fish and Wildlife Service in New Mexico who fit transmitters to the backs of eagles in an effort to find out more about their lives - and deaths.

      <description>Can badger cull extensions do anything to help tackle TB?</description>

      <body>Fresh from leading his very own dessert campaign, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is now doing his bit for "iconic species". And no, I don't mean badgers. Mr Paterson is visiting Kenya this week where he will announce that British Army paratroopers will provide training for members for local wildlife rangers in their fight against poaching. "Illegal poaching is having a devastating effect on some of the world's most iconic species and we must work together to tackle it," Mr Paterson said ahead of his visit. But perhaps the training and guidance that the paratroopers will be providing, could also be put to good effect back home? As well as details of Mr Paterson's safari to save endangered species, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published his latest written ministerial statement on the badger cull taking place in Gloucestershire and West Somerset. You'll recall that in both pilot areas, the culling companies were forced to apply to Natural England for extra time to meet the 70% target stipulated in their licences. In West Somerset the natural born cullers were authorised to kill an extra 165 badgers in the three weeks of added time. They managed to shoot an extra 90. So instead of the 70% needed to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle, the men of the night managed to get to 65%. Perhaps with some of that paratrooper training, they would have hit the target? Or maybe those dastardly poachers could be persuaded to visit West Somerset and Gloucestershire? According to Mr Paterson, the failure to hit the magic number doesn't really matter. For this is but year one of a grand four-year plan. This is not to be confused with those old Soviet five-year plans where the harvests were always abundant, and the workers were always smiling. In his statement, Mr Paterson said the advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer "was that a further increase in the number of badgers culled after the initial six-week period would improve the disease control benefits achieved even further and enable them to accrue earlier. "With the further removal of badgers seen," Mr Paterson went on, "the extension has been successful in meeting this aim." So even if they had shot just one extra badger, would that also improve the disease control benefits? I'm getting a sense that goalposts might once again be in motion. Because just a year ago, when he was explaining to the House of Commons why the badger cull should be postponed, Mr Paterson was at pains to say that getting to this magic number was crucial to the success of the trial. "It would be wrong to go ahead if those on the ground cannot be confident of removing at least 70% of the populations," he said at the time. There's an old adage in boxing, that tactical plans go out the window when you get the first punch on the nose. It would appear that Mr Paterson's hooter has been shipping a few blows.

      <body>Colombia's Constitutional Court will decide on Thursday whether to reopen Bogota's famous bullfighting ring. In the lead up to the decision, the issue has been raging on social media. Colombians love social media. Anyone who's anyone in the world of politics, sport or celebrity in Colombia uses Twitter. And bullfighting is one of the hottest issues at the moment, says Camilo Andres Garcia, a journalist, high-profile Twitter user and social media commentator in Bogota, who is opposed to bullfighting. It's the blood when the bull dies that many Colombians find hard to deal with. There has been enough human blood shed during the country's decades-long conflict, he says. Bullfighting is associated with the elite in Colombia - and conjures up images of rich ranch owners and women in hats and fancy dresses. There are many high profile supporters of bullfighters - including a number of Colombian newspapers - but on social media, they appear to be losing the PR battle. There are two rival hashtags doing the rounds on Twitter in Colombia ahead of this court decision, #LasCorridasNOVuelvenABogota - bullfighting won't return to Bogota - and #VuelvenlosTorosaBogota - the bulls are coming back to Bogota. The anti-crowd's voice is far louder though (12,000 tweets on their hashtag, versus fewer than 200 on the pro-side at the time of writing). "It's a very important decision for our family," says Diana Carolina Baquero Hernandez, a journalist and bullfighting radio host. Her family's history is bound up with Bogota's bullfighting ring, Plaza la Santamaria. Her father's uncle was once the manager, and many of her relatives were born and grew up inside the stadium. "Bullfighting is our life, our passion, our tradition," she says. Baquero-Hernandez has set up a Facebook page in support of bullfighting, but it's small-scale, and she admits her side is being drowned out. She says many who criticise bullfighting are ill-informed. "I feel angry sometimes because I feel people don't understand the real meaning of bullfighting. Bullfighting is an art." Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <body>India's launch of a small unmanned satellite to Mars is being described as a giant leap for its space programme. Science writer Pallava Bagla writes on what the mission means for India and the world. If all goes well and the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the United States, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. India's 1,350kg (2,976lb) robotic satellite which is undertaking the 10-month-long, over 200-million-kilometre journey to Mars is equipped with five instruments. They include a sensor to track methane or marsh gas - a possible sign of life - on Mars, a colour camera for taking pictures, and a thermal imaging spectrometer to map the surface and mineral wealth of the planet. The mission will also analyse the thin Martian atmosphere. After India's successful unmanned Chandrayaan mission to the Moon in 2008 that brought back the first clinching evidence of the presence of water there, the Mars mission, according to K Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), is a "natural progression". More than 500 scientists from the Bangalore-based Isro worked round the clock on this $73m (£45m) mission, which was announced by PM Manmohan Singh in August last year. Project chief Subbiah Arunan says he has not taken a vacation in the last 15 months, sleeping at Isro's satellite centre in Bangalore and going home for "about one or two hours every day". So does India's Mars mission mark the beginning of a new Asian space race? India sees the Mars mission as an opportunity to beat its regional rival China in reaching the planet, especially after a Russian mission carrying the first Chinese satellite to Mars failed in November 2011. Japan also failed in a similar effort in 1998. China has beaten India in space in almost every aspect so far: it has rockets that can lift four times more weight than India's, and in 2003, successfully launched its first human space flight which India has not yet embarked on. China launched its maiden mission to the Moon in 2007, ahead of India. So if India's mission succeeds, it will have something to feel proud about. "National pride is important. If the Mars mission succeeds, it will be a big morale booster for India. We are not in a space race," says SK Shivakumar, director of Isro's Bangalore-based satellite centre. The risks can be high in a space race. Since 1960 about 40 missions to Mars have been launched, more than half of which have failed. And no nation - apart from Mars Express, Europe's maiden venture to Mars representing 20 countries - has succeeded in its maiden venture. Though India says its Mars mission is the cheapest inter-planetary mission ever to have been undertaken in half a century of space exploration, some are questioning its scientific purpose. "This is a highly suboptimal mission with limited scientific objectives," says D Raghunandan of Delhi Science Forum, a think tank. Others like economist-activist Jean Dreze have said the mission "seems to be part of the Indian elite's delusional quest for superpower status". Rejecting such talk, a top government official says: "We have heard these arguments since the 1960s, about India being a poor country not needing or affording a space programme. "If we can't dare to dream big it would leave us as hewers of wood and drawers of water! India is today too big to be just living on the fringes of high technology."

      <body>The man who invented molecular gastronomy - the adventurous style of cooking popularised by chefs including Heston Blumenthal - has developed a new concept which he claims will solve the challenge of feeding an overpopulated world. French physical chemist Herve This says every foodstuff is made up of a basic chemical mixture - and so it's possible to create nutritious dishes from powders, oils and liquids that contain the building-blocks of food, rather than conventional raw ingredients. He calls the principle Note by Note cuisine and says it is like a painter using primary colours, or a musician composing note by note. The result is food not as we know it, more like being given a chemistry set on your plate. Herve This showed BBC News how Note by Note works, and explained why he thought it was so important for cooking to change.

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <body>India is preparing to send a robotic spacecraft into orbit around Mars - a first for the country. Yogita Limaye from the BBC's India Business Report spoke to K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) - the country's space agency - about his hopes for the mission. A: Essentially in this Mars mission, which we are planning, the prime objective is to demonstrate India's capability to capture the Martian orbit and then to conduct a few meaningful scientific experiments. A: See, essentially when we talk about Mars and exploration of Mars, you look at life as one of those goals. So (we look for) the presence of methane in the Martian environment and see whether this methane, if it is there, has a biological origin or a geological origin. We also would like to study the Martian atmosphere and the escape processes there. A: No, see Curiosity is measuring the presence of methane in a small area where it is there today. We are talking about the entire Martian environment. So Curiosity saying "no" is not a point to be worried about. A: Any mission to Mars has to be done in an opportune window and the imminent window is November 2013, that is we need to get out of this sphere of influence of earth by 30 November to ensure that we have the minimum distance between Earth and Mars. Now we are launching this Mars orbiter from Sriharikota in the east coast of India in the first week of November and then the PSLV-XL (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) is used for the launch which will put this orbiter into an elliptical orbit around the Earth... then around the last week of November, we have a crucial operation, it's called the "trans-Martian injection" where the spacecraft is directed towards Mars. Then it is a long voyage of 300 days where the orbiter spacecraft passes through the sphere of influence of the Earth... Then it goes through a long phase of heliocentric flight where the orbiter spacecraft will be influenced not only by the Sun but by the other planets too. Then as it approaches Mars... we have another major action: capturing the orbit of Mars, which is on 21st of September 2014. A: Soon after the orbiter is put into the orbit of Mars, we would start the experimentation and even before this orbiter reaches the Martian environment we would be calibrating these instruments as it travels from Earth to Mars. But the most important part of it is looking at the distances involved. It takes at least 20 minutes for any signal to come from the Mars orbiter to Earth in some phases. It could be anything between four to 20 minutes one-way. A: Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: "it is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society." And in this area, India has become a role model for the whole world. Let me talk in terms of numbers. We spend in India about a billion dollars for the space programme. If we look at the central government expenditure, we spend 0.34% of its budget for the space programme. This goes primarily for building satellites in communications and remote sensing and navigation for space applications. Nearly 35% of it goes on launch vehicle development and about 7-8% goes on the science and exploration programme. So the Mars mission we're talking about today is part of that 8% of the 0.34% of Indian central government expenditure. And if you look at the benefit that the country has accrued over the years, it has surpassed the money that has been spent in terms of tangible and intangible benefits. [This can be expressed in terms of] the advantage that the people have got, the fishermen have got, the farmers have got, the government bodies have got for informed decision-making, the support the country has got for disaster management and by providing a communication infrastructure for this country using the INSAT satellites. Today we have nearly 10 communication satellites and 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. This is a great revolution that has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme. A: See, Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter, but Chandrayaan-2 as you said looks at the surface of the Moon using a rover and a landing module there. In 2009-2010, we planned this as a joint mission where India was to provide the launch and the orbiter and Russia was to provide the lander and the rover. Over these years there has been a programmatic realignment on this and, as of now, the plan is that the rover will be made by India and the lander will also be developed by India, and we must have this lander developed by the year 2016. Now, we also require a reliable GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket) for launching Chandrayaan-2. In December 2013, we are going to launch the GSLV T5 rocket with our own cryogenic engine stage. If that is successful, and we are able to have one more successful flight of the GSLV, then we would be ready - from the launch angle - for Chandrayaan-2. So, this is the scenario emerging and there will be scientific experiments in the lander module and in the rover, and a few in the orbiter too. Yes, 2016 is the correct target and the limiting factor for that is the development of the lander module. A: See, as of now we have no declared programme on human space flight, but in the year 2006-07 we began a study... and as of now we have taken up the critical new technologies that India needs to master a human space flight. The core module development, environment control and life support systems, the crew escape system, these are all part of that and we are working on it at the moment. But we require a human-rated vehicle that is capable of taking the crew module into a lower orbit. So you need to have a reliable GSLV for a manned mission or a GSLV Mark 3 developed and then manned-rated. A: As of now, there is no timeline for a mission but we are working on the development of the critical technologies required for it. A: Let me first say each country has its own priorities and focus. Right from the beginning, right from the early sixties, India's focus has been on peaceful uses of outer space and space applications and there India is today a role model for the whole world. One can be proud of it. China has its own priorities and it is moving in that direction. So, we are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services. We need to do it more cost-effectively and deliver it to the target audience in the country, whether it is to the people or the government or other agencies in the country. So that has been the focus of the Indian space programme. This interview has been abridged for reasons of article length. </body>

      <title>Thorium backed as a 'future fuel'</title>
      <description>Could thorium usher in a new era of nuclear power?</description>

      <body>Nuclear scientists are being urged by the former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix to develop thorium as a new fuel. Mr Blix says that the radioactive element may prove much safer in reactors than uranium. It is also more difficult to use thorium for the production of nuclear weapons. His comments will add to growing levels of interest in thorium, but critics warn that developing new reactors could waste public funds. Mr Blix, the former Swedish foreign minister, told BBC News: "I’m a lawyer not a scientist but in my opinion we should be trying our best to develop the use of thorium. I realise there are many obstacles to be overcome but the benefits would be great. "I am told that thorium will be safer in reactors - and it is almost impossible to make a bomb out of thorium. These are very major factors as the world looks for future energy supplies." His enthusiasm is shared by some in the British nuclear establishment. Scientists at the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) have been encouraged by the government to help research on an Indian thorium-based reactor, and on a test programme in Norway. The Norway tests at the OECD’s nuclear trials facility in Halden are conducted in a Bond-style underground bunker. A couple of charming Nordic homes perch on top of a hill at the edge of the town. Below them a garage door in a cliff face leads into a tunnel deep into the hill where the reactor hall lies. In theory, at least, the mountain protects the town from an accident. The thorium tests are being carried out by a private firm, Thor Energy (the element itself was discovered in Norway in 1828 and named after the Norse god of thunder). The company hopes to get thorium licensed alongside uranium in current water-cooled reactor plants. The British government says it would be useful to increase the fuel options for nuclear operators, as thorium is believed to be three times more plentiful than uranium. It is also currently being produced as a by-product from mining rare earths. Staff from NNL have been advising Thor on the use of mixed oxide fuels (MOX). NNL has also been helping the Indian authorities develop a thorium reactor, as India sits on top of the world’s biggest thorium reserves. The Thor project represents an evolutionary approach, using thorium in existing reactors together with uranium or plutonium. Oystein Asphjell, chief executive of Thor Energy told BBC News: "There is lots of thorium in the world, very well distributed all over the globe. In operations, in a reactor, it has some chemical and physical properties that make it really superior to uranium as well. On the waste side, we don’t generate long lived waste." China is going for a revolutionary approach, devising a next-generation reactor which its supporters say will enable thorium to be used much more safely than uranium. When a uranium reactor overheats and the fuel rods can’t contain the chain reaction, as happened at Fukushima, the crisis continues. If something happened to a thorium reactor, technicians could simply switch off the stimulus which comes from uranium or plutonium in a small feeder plant and the thorium reaction would halt itself. Prof Carlo Rubbia from Cern previously told BBC News: "Thorium will be able to shut itself off without any human intervention... You just switch off the beam.” "There are also no long-lived waste products... We estimate that after something like 400-500 years all the radioactivity will be dissipated away." These advantages, if they were realised, would be huge. But thorium still has many technical problems to overcome. What is more, countless billions have been ploughed into uranium-based research and development, and in the words of Mr Blix, uranium has a very deep furrow, backed by vested interests. Canada, China, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the UK and the US have experimented with thorium as a substitute fuel in the past. Questions are being raised, though, about the advisability of pinning the world’s energy ambitions on another nuclear dream. Environmentalists often allege that if renewable power had commanded a fraction as much research funding as nuclear it would already be much cheaper and more common. Dr Nils Bohmer, a nuclear physicist working for a Norwegian environmental NGO, Bellona, said developing thorium was a costly distraction from the need to cut emissions immediately to stave off the prospect of dangerous climate change. "The advantages of thorium are purely theoretical," he told BBC News. "The technology development is decades in the future. Instead I think we should focus on developing renewable technology - for example offshore wind technology - which I think has a huge potential to develop.” If thorium ever makes it as a commercial nuclear fuel, uranium may be seen as a massive and costly diversion. Some supporters of thorium believe that it was bypassed in the past because governments wanted the plutonium from certain conventional reactors to make atomic bombs. They believe thorium was rejected because it was simply too safe. Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <title>Secrets of the dino-titans revealed</title>
      <description>Computers reveal secrets of the sauropods</description>

      <body>In an era of giants, sauropods dwarfed everything. These dinoasurs, including the diplodocus, were the biggest to walk the Earth. T. rex would have nipped at the knees of the largest sauropod - Argentinosaurus huinculensis. University of Manchester researchers have now made a digital Argentinosaurus robot to work out how this 80-tonne monster would have moved its vast bulk. The study is published in an issue of PLoS One on "sauropod gigantism". The immense size of sauropods - the long-necked, tree-trunk-legged storybook giants of the Jurassic period - presents a quandary for biologists because they push animal bones and muscles to their limit. This is why researchers have set out to answer some of the big questions about these very big animals, including: How did their muscles and bones support and move their bodies? How did their digestive system process sufficient food? And how high could they have reached with their immensely long necks (much longer, proportionally, than a giraffe's)? "The biggest elephants weigh around six or seven tonnes," said Dr Bill Sellers, of the University of Manchester, who led the digital robot study. "So Argentinosaurus was at least 10 times bigger than the biggest elephant. "As you get bigger your weight goes up by the cube of your height, but the force your muscles can generate only goes up by the square, so your strength-to-weight ratio gets much worse." As with many dinosaurs, the reconstructions of this giant are based on a relatively limited fossilised jigsaw. For Argentinosaurus, only its legs and part of its spine have been unearthed. So controversy has raged over whether it was possible for an animal to be so huge and heavy and still able to walk on land. "Whenever anyone finds a dinosaur, they want it to be the biggest, meanest dinosaur ever, so there might be a temptation to make a reconstruction a bit bigger than it was," Dr Sellers told BBC News. "We wanted to test whether it was a reasonable reconstruction for an animal." To make the digital dinosaur, Dr Sellers and his colleagues scanned a reconstructed skeleton housed at the Carmen Funes municipal museum in Argentina. They were able to map muscles and tendons on to the skeleton using the anatomy of modern animals, including reptiles and birds, as a guide. Then came the difficult part - their digital dinosaur had to learn to walk. This, Dr Sellers said, required a technique called "machine learning". "The animal needs to learn how to move the best way it can using the muscles and skeleton we've given it," he said. This took a huge amount of computer processing power, as the simulated dinosaur robot took the information programmed into its virtual muscles and worked out how to use them to walk. The resulting steady march of this digital dinosaur revealed that, to keep its body steady, the movement at its joints had to be very restricted. "This animal is so big that it's right at the limit of what you could cope with as an animal that lives on land," said Dr Sellers. "So things like getting up off the ground would have been extraordinarily difficult if not impossible." Something else these beasts would not have been capable of, according to Prof Kent Stevens, of the University of Oregon, would be adopting the storybook pose of holding their heads aloft. He says that while "soaring necks is congruous with childhood expectations, the bones tell a different story". For his study, Prof Stevens also created virtual dinosaurs - digitally reconstructing the skeleton of Apatosaurus (better known in the past as brontosaurus). Dr Stevens said: " [If we] put sauropod neck vertebrae back together with the proper separations, and they form a very straight line." He says the bones simply do not have the curves seen in giraffes' or some birds' necks. A natural J-curve in a giraffe's vertebrae direct its neck upwards at a steep angle. A vertebral S-curve gives a swan its shapely neck. But while Prof Stevens' less soaring reconstructions of these dinosaurs might puncture childhood myths, his digital dinosaurs were still capable of impressive feats, thanks to their huge size. As his animations reveal, by sweeping its outstretched neck, Apatosaurus would have explored, and devoured food, over a huge space. "While none were very flexible, sauropods could sweep out broad areas - in some cases 10 or so metres above the ground," Prof Stevens said. All this sweeping and devouring provided a digestive challenge for these huge herbivores. And Dr Marcus Clauss, of the Clinic for Zoo Animals at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, set out to find out how their digestive systems coped. Just as Dr Sellers found that normal bones and muscles could carry 80 tonnes of bulk, it seems there was also nothing unusual about the sauropod gut. "A normal gut can work for any size of body," said Dr Clauss. "A mouse can get enough energy for its size, and an elephant can. The main thing is that [the elephant] eats much more." One key factor that seems to have allowed sauropods to become so gigantic is that they would swallow their food without chewing. As this unchewed food would spend so much time passing through extremely long intestines, it would have ample time to break down. "If you spend so much time chewing, you're limited in the amount of food you can take in," Dr Clauss said. "So one of the conditions for an animal to become that large is that it must not chew." The secret to just how massive these creatures were could be contained in their ancient fossilised trackways. Dr Tom Schanz, of Ruhr University in Germany, has lent his engineering skills to the study of dinosaurs by developing a technique to estimate sauropod weight from a single footprint. He is an engineer who studies the properties of soil to work out exactly how buildings will settle and move on their foundations. Dr Schanz's new method incorporates this expertise. His laser scanning of preserved footprints could produce the most accurate measurements yet of what the dinosaurs weighed. To prove this, Dr Schanz's team took an elephant for a walk. The researchers studied every "dynamic component" of the walk - measuring the speed at which the elephant planted its feet, and how its weight was distributed in each step. "[Then we used the] laser scanning technique on the elephant footprints and back-calculated the weight," Dr Schanz said. The team was able to calculate the elephant's weight to within 10%. And since sauropods and elephants have such similar anatomy, the scientist says the same technique could be used to estimate the weight of the extinct dinosaurs. Building up an accurate picture of how these animals worked is revealing some of the most basic aspects of biology, including how bones and muscles work, and what the very limits are of their ability to function. "That's very important," Dr Sellers says, "because these things go wrong very commonly, and the better we understand them, the better our chances are of fixing them." </body>

      <body>A US company has unveiled build-your-own toy robots that can drive, wiggle and react to the world around them. The modular system, called Moss, uses magnetic balls as joints and hinges, has no external wires, and works without the user having to write any computer code. By attaching a Bluetooth module, players can control the robots remotely using a smartphone or tablet. The system has been developed by Modular Robotics in Boulder, Colorado. The company launched the toys on crowdfunding website Kickstarter. But chief executive and design director Eric Schweikardt told the BBC: "We're already making Moss so we don't need the Kickstarter funding. But in 2013, it seems like the place where people look for cool new tech products." The final version of the robot kits would "begin shipping in January or February", he said. "We're at the very beginning of an exciting time for consumer robotics." Hod Lipson, professor of engineering at Cornell University, New York State, said: "Modular robotics have been around for decades, and we've always believed they could be cheap, robust and versatile. In practice, they've proved to be expensive and fragile. "Modular Robotics is one of the first companies putting in the effort to mass-produce these things." He believes such toys could help make robotics accessible to young children and interest them in engineering from a young age. Although he used to teach Mr Schweikardt, Prof Lipson stressed that he had no financial interest in the company. In October, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed off cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes. The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and stick together using magnets. </body>

      <body>A battery-powered robotic arm that boosts human strength has won the 2013 James Dyson award. The Titan Arm, designed by four mechanical engineering students from the University of Pennsylvania, could help people with back injuries rebuild and regain control of muscles. It can also be used by people to lift heavy objects as part of their work. The team, who spent eight months creating the exoskeleton, will share a prize of £30,000 ($48,000). "Titan Arm is obviously an ingenious design, but the team's use of modern, rapid - and relatively inexpensive - manufacturing techniques makes the project even more compelling," said Sir James Dyson. "We are ecstatic," team member Nick Parrotta told the BBC. "It was totally unexpected - just incredible." The team produced its prototype for £1,200, which they say is a 50th of the typical cost of similar exoskeletons currently on the market. "We wanted Titan Arm to be affordable, as exoskeletons are rarely covered by health insurance," said Mr Parrotta, 23, currently studying for a masters in mechanical engineering. "This informed our design decisions and the materials we used. Most structural components are machined from inexpensive aluminium." The arm incorporates a rigid back brace to maintain posture, a shoulder featuring rotational joints, and sensors that can track motion and relay data back to doctors for remote prognosis. It can augment human weight-lifting strength by 40lbs (18kg), say the inventors, while the batteries can last for up to eight hours, depending on intensity of usage and workload. The current prototype is operated by a separate joystick, but future versions may incorporate electromyography technology, said Mr Parrotta, which picks up electrical signals produced by muscle tissue, thus allowing users to operate such prosthetics almost without thinking. All of the inventors who took part in the competition used 3D-printing to develop and produce their prototypes much more cheaply than would have been possible before. "Prototyping technology, previously reserved only for companies with big research and development budgets, is enabling young inventors to develop sophisticated concepts at university," said Sir James. "They can revitalise industries on a small budget - it is a good time to be an inventor." The second prize went to a Japanese team who created Handie, a prosthetic hand with sensors that can read brain signals. A 3D-printed plastic cast for broken limbs, invented by a team from New Zealand, took the third prize. The James Dyson Foundation runs the annual award across 18 countries with the aim of encouraging problem-solving inventions. </body>

      <description>Twitter shares are priced at $26 each, ahead of the biggest stock market debut of a technology firm since Facebook went public in 2012.</description>

      <body>Twitter shares have been priced at $26 each, ahead of its debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Thursday. That is above the $23 to $25 range announced on Monday and values the short messaging service at more than $18bn (£11bn). That makes it the biggest market debut for a technology firm since Facebook went public in May 2012. Twitter has attracted 230 million users since starting seven years ago, but is yet to make a profit. Its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier and a recent poll by Reuters/Ipsos showed that more than a third of registered users do not use the service at all. Nevertheless there was strong demand for the shares and the company was able to raise the offering price twice. Some analysts said that investors were excited by Twitter's potential for growth. "Investors see social media and mobile as sweet spots and it is therefore no surprise that Twitter's IPO is creating so much excitement and is oversubscribed," said Eden Zoller of consulting firm Ovum. However, she added that "Twitter needs to step up and deliver on the expectations that are fuelling its valuation, and show that it has what it takes to provide a sustainable business model". The firm has posted an increase in its sales, which more than doubled in third quarter to $168.6m, and it is looking to raise even more revenue from advertisers outside the United States. Mark Mahaney at RBC Capital Markets said that he expected the firm's shares to rise after listing. "Just as Google, Amazon and Facebook have become Internet utilities, so too may Twitter," he said. "As a public, real-time, conversational and distributed platform, Twitter is becoming an essential service for consumers, businesses, media companies, and advertiser." Twitter's $18bn valuation includes the value of shares in compensation schemes for employees and other share awards. Co-founder Evan Williams is the biggest shareholder in the firm with a stake of more than 10% worth more than a billion dollars. Another of the founders, Jack Dorsey, will also become a very rich man. His 4% stake is worth more than half a billion dollars. Biz Stone, another co-founder, is thought to have made millions by selling holdings over the last few years. But Noah Glass, also one of the originals, is believed to have made very little from the company's success. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise $1.82bn, for the company. Unlike Facebook, Twitter has chosen to trade its shares on the New York Stock Exchange. Facebook's debut on the Nasdaq - traditionally the market of choice for technology firms - was marred by delays and problems with orders. The NYSE has already tested trading of Twitter's shares to try to avoid any technical hitches. The shares will trade under the symbol "TWTR". </body>

      <title>Marketplace Silk Road 'back online'</title>
      <description>Reports suggest that the Silk Road, an anonymous marketplace for drugs that operated at the fringes of the web, is back online.</description>

      <body>Reports suggest that the Silk Road, the anonymous marketplace that traded in drugs and other illegal goods, is back online, in a new version. According to AllThingsVice, a website that monitors the so-called dark net, the new site is already selling a wide range of drugs. The first version of Silk Road was shut down by the FBI in October and its alleged administrator arrested. But those behind it always vowed to revive the site. The new administrator of the revived site has adopted the same handle as the previous operator - Dread Pirate Roberts. The FBI believe that arrested 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was the mastermind behind the original site. Mr Ulbricht has denied all charges The twitter feed for Dread Pirate Roberts reads: "#SilkRoad has lift-off". According to AllThingsVice, the new homepage reads "This Hidden Site Has Risen Again", parodying the US Department of Justice notice, which read "the hidden site has been seized". Twitter was buzzing with talk of whether the new site was a genuine replacement or a scam. Others asked how long it would take before it was closed down by the FBI. According to Ken Westin, a researcher with security firm TripWire, the site looks genuine. "It appears to be run by the same folks that were running it before," he said. "They are not going to be able to kill it. It is going to be a game of cat and mouse with the FBI," he added. Etay Maor, a fraud prevention manager with security firm Trusteer, and an expert on the dark net, said it was anyone's guess how long it would last. "It could be 24 hours or it could be a year." But with the Silk Road banking over $1.3bn (£810m) in two years from taking a percentage of sales, he is not surprised that it may be back online. "It is big business and those behind it want to get it back up," he said. In the aftermath of the Silk Road shutdown, alternative dark net marketplaces saw huge increases in traffic. One, dubbed Project Black Flag, closed down shortly after launch, with the founder Metta Dread Pirate taking the Bitcoin currency accumulated on it with him. He wrote on the site's forum: "I am sorry for my actions, but with the funds I gathered from the site, I will be able to keep myself from being homeless for the next several months". But there were plenty more, said Mr Maor. "The Silk Road was the biggest and everyone knew it, but it is scary the amount of sites on the dark net. "From selling weapons to money collection for jihadist groups. You name it - the worse things you can think of, it's all there," he said. </body>

      <title>Concept car ditches steering wheel</title>
      <description>Toyota previews a concept car that lacks a steering wheel, instead suggesting drivers would control it by shifting their body weight.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24837760</url>

      <body>Toyota has suggested motorists of the future could ride about in a vehicle inspired by a horse. It has announced a concept car that drivers would control by shifting their body weight while standing, doing away with the need for a steering wheel. One analyst said the current design posed too many safety issues, but did point towards future developments. The FV2 vehicle will make its official debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in two weeks' time. Toyota suggested leaning forwards, backwards or to the side to determine the FV2's direction would be "intuitive", adding that voice and facial recognition sensors would bring up information to assist users in their journeys. Suggested destinations and other data would be shown on an augmented reality display presented on the windscreen, it said. The aim was to develop aspects of trust and understanding between the vehicle and the rider "similar to those a rider will have with a horse". "This is an imagination piece rather than something that will be seen in production in the next few years," a spokesman told the BBC. "But some of the technologies we're suggesting could be introduced further down the line - say in five to 10 years' time." Carmakers often release images and models of imagined futuristic vehicles to coincide with motor shows. Although they are sometimes little more than a publicity stunt, they can be valuable as a way of seeking early feedback and helping determine where research and development funds should be invested. It can still take a long time for successful ideas to come to fruition. For example, Toyota first showed off the idea of making a hybrid - combining both an internal combustion engine and an electrical propulsion system - in 1977 when it unveiled a special version of its Sports 800 GT at the Tokyo show. It was 20 years later that it released its first hybrid for sale to the public - the Prius - in Japan. Other examples of tech first seen in concept vehicles include panoramic glass roofs, now found in some Renault and Mercedes cars among others, and using touchscreen panels to do away with dashboard buttons, as is the case in Tesla's Model S. One expert said the Toyota's latest design was intended to address a problem worrying the industry at large. "Lots of carmakers are very frightened by the fact many young people can't afford a car and insurance, and the whole concept of a traditional motor vehicle doesn't really appeal to them," said Paul Newton from the consultants IHS Automotive. "I think in practical terms the FV2 won't see the light of day - if you are standing up and leaning to move it, my first thought would be, what if you hit something? The likelihood of it being licensed in today's safety-conscious environment is zero. "But concepts are the proving ground for lots of technologies that do come into mainstream production, and many things will happen in the next 25 years that will redefine what we've probably spent a good part of century looking at as the norm." Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Honda are among the other firms who have announced they will be unveiling concept vehicles at the Tokyo Motor Show, which runs from 22 November to 1 December. </body>

      <body>The mystery of why Google has moored two barges off the US coast appears to have been solved. The search giant has issued a statement saying it intends to use the structures as learning spaces for people to find out about new tech. The announcement follows feverish media speculation over the past fortnight about the company's plans. One popular theory had been that the vessels would be used as floating wave-powered data centres. Government inspectors had signed confidentiality agreements about the four-storey building in San Francisco Bay and another similar structure off Portland, Maine. "Google Barge... a floating data centre? A wild party boat? A barge housing the last remaining dinosaur?" a spokeswoman joked. "Sadly, none of the above. Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barges as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology." </body>

      <title>Call of Duty faces frame-rate issues</title>
      <description>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game report problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title.</description>

      <body>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game have reported problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title. Testers said that its frame rate dropped at several points during the game causing a stutter-effect. The PS4 version of CoD: Ghosts is the only console edition that renders its images in 1080p high definition. The Xbox One and Wii U versions create less processor-intensive 720p resolutions. Publisher Activision has not commented. Although the PS4 version of the game is already on sale, Sony's console itself will not be released until 15 November in North America and 29 November in Europe. That potentially gives Activision time to release a software patch if the issue can be fixed. Ghosts is the 10th first-person shooter game in the main CoD series. Its predecessor, Black Ops II, earned $1bn (£621m) in its first 15 days of release, making it the second fastest-selling game of all time after Grand Theft Auto 5. Earlier this week, the head of Activision's Infinity Ward studio - which developed the newest title - told the BBC that his team had made delivering smooth animations a priority. "One of the key pillars of Call of Duty has been 60 frames per second... and ensuring that was of utmost importance, and the resolutions that appear are geared around that," said Mark Rubin. Elsewhere he suggested that the different way the new consoles handled memory had contributed to a decision to support 1080p graphics on Sony's machine but not Microsoft's. However, some reviews have suggested the PS4 version does not maintain a consistent frame rate as desired. "The PlayStation 4 version... has noticeable technical issues, sometimes slowing to a crawl, particularly during set-piece moments with multiple effects," reported Joystiq. "Frame rate hitches happen throughout the campaign on PlayStation 4 and, in a series known for its Hollywood-inspired bombast, it detracted from the experience." Now Gamer added that it was particularly concerned about the issue occurring during the title's online multiplayer mode. "It's rare - it only happened once every few matches - but it is definitely present," it said. "It's not something we've seen in any Call of Duty multiplayer before, so it stood out as particularly odd and unfortunate, given the frame-rate stutter is significant enough to let targets escape to safety or see you killed during the general mayhem." The blog Gearnuke has gathered together other complaints of a similar nature. Although Activision has yet to provide a statement, Mr Rubin had previously acknowledged: "There's enormous amounts of work ahead of us in perfecting our game engines on both [Sony and Microsoft's] platforms." Sony has not commented on the subject. However, Microsoft has addressed the fact the Xbox One version of Ghosts renders graphics in half the resolution of the PS4, despite the fact both consoles support the 1080p format. "Once people have the chance to play the games and experience Xbox One for themselves, we believe they'll realise that great-looking visuals are only part of the experience," said a spokesman. "Launch is the first of many steps into the new console generation, and we fully expect our developers to continue to break new ground and surpass previous limitations in the years ahead." Reviews of the Xbox One version of Ghosts remain under embargo until 12 November. </body>

      <body>Google, the world's leading search engine, has been ordered by a French court to remove links to images of ex-F1 boss Max Mosley with prostitutes. Google said the ruling "should worry all those who defend freedom of expression on the internet". It intends to appeal, French media say. Mr Mosley successfully sued the UK's now-defunct News of the World after it ran a story in 2008 claiming he had organised an orgy with Nazi overtones. He won damages for breach of privacy. The News of the World secretly filmed the former Formula One chief with five prostitutes and published a front-page story. He won £60,000 ($90,000) damages after a judge ruled that there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme and found that his privacy had been breached. Mr Mosley won a similar ruling in France in 2011 when a judge ordered the newspaper's owner News Corp to pay £32,000 ($48,000) in costs and damages because copies of the paper and the video were circulated across the Channel. Speaking in 2011, Mr Mosley told a UK inquiry into a phone-hacking scandal at News Corp that he was pursuing legal action against Google in Germany and France over the search results. Mr Mosley said Google had agreed to remove links to material from the story on a case-by-case basis. But he claimed that when he had asked the firm to re-programme its technology to ensure it did not show up at all in searches about him it had refused as "a matter of principle" even though it was "technically feasible". "I think you cannot underestimate that if someone puts a picture on the web that they shouldn't, that will go on forever unless action is taken," he said. "As soon as a search engine finds it is available to everybody and the thing you sued over and won over is republished again and again... Clearly that can be stopped and should be stopped in my opinion," Mr Mosley said at the time. </body>

      <body>The last 300 Blockbuster Video film rental stores in the US are closing in the face of unrelenting competition from online digital video, corporate parent company Dish Network has said. About 2,800 people are expected to lose their jobs by early January. The once-dominant chain filed for bankruptcy, pummelled by Netflix's DVD-by-post and online streaming services. Dish Network, a satellite television provider, will also end Blockbuster's own DVD-by-post service in December. About 50 US stores that are operated as independent franchises will remain open. "This is not an easy decision, yet consumer demand is clearly moving to digital distribution of video entertainment," said Joseph Clayton, Dish president and chief executive officer, in a statement. "Despite our closing of the physical distribution elements of the business, we continue to see value in the Blockbuster brand, and we expect to leverage that brand as we continue to expand our digital offerings." The firm's UK division was sold to private equity firm Gordon Brothers Europe in March, two months after it went into administration. But Blockbuster UK went back into administration in late October, as Gordon Brothers said it was unable to broker a licensing deal with Dish to start a new digital platform for the brand. The BBC has learned that Blockbuster's UK online subscription service has been suspended. </body>

      <body>A blogger who turned to crowdfunding website Indiegogo to raise money to tweet from the UK's phone-hacking trial has hit his target. Peter Jukes has raised more than £4,000 to pay "his living expenses" for the trial's duration. The trial of News of the World staff including ex-editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson has attracted huge media interest. Mr Jukes has followed the case for some years, including writing a book. He attended court in London to hear the prosecution's opening remarks and posted details of proceedings, expressing surprise that live tweeting was allowed for the rest of the trial. While he wanted to continue, he said on his blog that he would have to stop "for financial reasons". "I'm broke (mortgage-defaulting broke to be honest) and so will have to seek other work in the months ahead," he wrote. But following many requests to continue he decided to turn to crowdfunding to raise money to cover his basic costs. "Despite a bit of embarrassment, I'm going to put pride to the side and see if I can do that," he said on his Indiegogo page. A day later, Mr Jukes hit his target, with six days of funding left to run. He said the amount would allow him to continue covering the case until Christmas. The trial is expected to last for up to six months. There are eight defendants - some are charged with phone hacking or conspiracy to commit misconduct and others with perverting the course of justice. All the charges are denied. The judge, Justice Saunders, has already made clear his feelings about the importance of the trial, saying that the case puts UK justice on trial as well as the defendants. Mr Jukes has been following the case for online publication The Daily Beast and has also written a book The Fall of the House of Murdoch. </body>

      <body>Microsoft has warned that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers. It said attackers could exploit this by requesting users to preview or open a specially crafted email or web content. Microsoft said it was "aware of targeted attacks" and was investigating. The issue affects Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Office 2003 - 2010, and Microsoft Lync. Recent versions of Microsoft Windows and Office are not affected by the issue - which centres on a graphics component. Details of which products are at risk are listed on the firm's site. Microsoft said it would take appropriate action to address the issue, which "may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs". In the meantime, it has advised customers to apply workarounds - a setting or configuration change that "does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available". According to Microsoft, the flaw lies in the handling of the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image files by a graphics processing component in the affected software versions. In a blog post on the Microsoft Security Response Centre, Dustin Childs a communications manager, said any move by hackers "requires user interaction". He said that the attacks are disguised as an email requesting potential targets to open a specially crafted Word attachment. If the attachment is opened or previewed, it attempts to exploit the issue using a malformed graphics image embedded in the document. "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user," Mr Childs said. Microsoft added that hackers could also exploit the issue via a web-based attack. "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website," it said. However, it added that an attacker would have "no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content". "Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website." </body>

      <description>Apple reveals details of requests it has received from governments across the globe to share customer data.</description>

      <body>Apple has revealed details of requests it has received from governments across the globe to share customer data. The US government, which made between 1,000 and 2,000 requests in the six months to 30 June, topped the list. The firm said the US requests affected 2,000 to 3,000 accounts, adding it gave out data on zero to 1,000 accounts. This is the first time Apple has shared such data, but it is still not allowed to reveal the exact number of requests relating to US national security. Apple said the most common "requests involve robberies and other crimes or requests from law enforcement officers searching for missing persons". It said the response usually involves disclosing information about an account holder's iTunes or iCloud account "such as a name and an address". "In very rare cases, we are asked to provide stored photos or email. We consider these requests very carefully and only provide account content in extremely limited circumstances," the firm said. The UK was second on the list, with 127 requests. Spain, Germany and Australia also featured in the top five. The tech giant added that since its main business was "not about collecting information", the vast majority of requests it received from law enforcement agencies were about information on "lost or stolen devices". The company logs these requests under a separate category as "device requests" which, it said, "never include national security-related requests". Apple received more than 3,500 such requests in the US between January and June this year. Apple also used the report to call for more freedom to disclose the details of such requests to customers. It said that currently the US government did not allow it to disclose "except in broad ranges, the number of national security orders, the number of accounts affected by the orders, or whether content, such as emails, was disclosed". "We strongly oppose this gag order," it added. It said it had asked the government to ease these restrictions but so far had not seen any major changes. "Despite our extensive efforts in this area, we do not yet have an agreement that we feel adequately addresses our customers' right to know how often and under what circumstances we provide data to law enforcement agencies". Earlier this year, Google, Facebook and Microsoft asked the US government to allow them to disclose the security requests they receive to hand over user data. The move by these companies came after leaks by whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed mass surveillance programmes by the National Security Agency (NSA) and associated agencies. Apple said it had filed a letter with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court supporting a group of cases requesting greater transparency. "We will continue to aggressively pursue our ability to be more transparent." </body>

      <body>The Bitcoin virtual currency is vulnerable to a "selfish" attack that would let someone gradually take control of the digital cash system. The theoretical attack tries to subvert the way that computers involved in Bitcoin share information. It plays upon the fact that everyone involved in keeping track of Bitcoin assumes all participants are honest. Such an attack could already be happening, said the US researchers who discovered the vulnerability. "Bitcoin is broken, " wrote Prof Emin Surer, one of the Cornell University scientists who developed the attack, in a blogpost describing the work. The weakness he and Dr Ittay Eyal uncovered is fundamental to the way that Bitcoin works, he said, and emerges from the way that people find or mint new coins. Typically new Bitcoins are generated by getting lots of computers to tackle a complicated cryptographic puzzle. At any given moment thousands of computers are involved in tackling this puzzle. Roughly every ten minutes one group involved in solving this puzzle is rewarded with Bitcoins. The process is known as "mining" because, like miners, those who take part have to sift a lot of dross before they find a valuable nugget. As soon as the new coins are found, the news is circulated and everyone starts working on the next puzzle. One Bitcoin is currently worth about £145. The Cornell attack involves one large mining group that does not say when it has been rewarded with new Bitcoins. This "selfish" mining group then begins working on the cryptographic puzzle that will eventually release the next reward. This gives it an advantage because every other mining group will still be working on a puzzle that has already been solved. By leveraging this advantage and being careful about when they release information about new Bitcoins they have mined, the group could gradually take control of the entire mining system. "Once the system veers away from the happy mode where everyone is honest, there is no force that opposes the growth of really large pools that command control of the currency," wrote Prof Surer. The pair pointed out that there were already mining groups big enough to mount a selfish attack on the protocol. The two researchers have also proposed updating the protocol to limit the size of mining groups and make the whole system less susceptible to a selfish attack. Vitalik Buterin, technical editor of Bitcoin Magazine, said the attack was "highly theoretical" because no software currently existed that could turn an honest mining group into a selfish one. At the moment Bitcoin software shares information about what different miners are doing with the entire community. For a group to become selfish they would have to change this fundamental Bitcoin software in order to manipulate this information flow. In addition, he said, only the biggest pools could try to subvert the system and the communication demands of the network would likely stymie those attempts. In addition, he said, the rewards of selfish behaviour were outweighed by the benefits of being honest. "No honest (or semi-honest) miner would want to join a selfish pool," he suggested. "Even if they do have a small incentive to [join], they have an even greater incentive to not break the Bitcoin network to preserve the value of their own Bitcoins and mining hardware." </body>

      <title>Telecom firms under spying scrutiny</title>
      <description>Privacy International demands an investigation into exactly how telecom firms worked with intelligence agencies.</description>

      <body>Privacy International has asked the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to investigate telecoms companies over the alleged interception of private data on their networks. It follows allegations from whistle-blower Edward Snowden that fibre-optic networks were accessed as part of mass surveillance programmes. His latest leaks suggest that data was intercepted on British territory. The privacy group wants more information about how this was done. "With each passing day, the public finds out more and more how private companies are colluding with governments to operate mass surveillance programs that intercept our daily phone calls, text messages, emails and personal data," said Eric King, head of research at Privacy International. "Far from being coerced, it appears some of the companies have gone well beyond their legal responsibility by colluding with GCHQ on its Tempora [data collection] programme. "We call on these companies to do the right thing and halt their involvement with mass surveillance," he added. Privacy International wants companies such as Level 3, BT, Verizon, Vodafone Cable, Viatel and Interoute to explain all the steps they took to oppose or challenge requests from GCHQ, the UK's intelligence gathering headquarters, in Cheltenham. It also wants them to cease any voluntary compliance with GCHQ and introduce policies to ensure that further requests do not interfere with what it calls "the fundamental right to privacy". In response BT said that it would study the details of "any complaint we receive". "We are clear that matters of national security are for governments, not telecommunications providers. As a company, we comply with the law," it told the BBC. Level 3 said: "All of the countries where we deliver services have law enforcement and security concerns, and we are periodically compelled by in-country government authorities to assist in their investigations. Our policy is the same everywhere. We comply with applicable local law, including all the applicable laws in the UK, while taking all reasonable steps to protect our customers' privacy." Meanwhile Interoute declined to comment. "The particular concern of Privacy International is that phone companies and [internet service providers] went beyond what the law required, either because they wanted a quiet life or because they thought that it was a good thing to do," said digital forensic expert Prof Peter Sommer. Unwinding what legislation had been used and whether warrants had been issued for each intercept could be tricky though, he added. "One of the puzzling things is how does it happen politically? Do the spooks go to their political masters and say, 'We are going dark. We can't follow the people we want to follow,' and ask for special warrants?" "And if these are granted why aren't the politicians asking whether it is a good idea or not?" Last week the Washington Post alleged that the US National Security Agency had worked with British counterpart GCHQ to access the private data networks of Yahoo and Google. The paper said it did not know exactly how the interception had worked only that it "happens on British territory". Slides supplied by Edward Snowden appeared to show that the NSA had tools that could pull apart data packages sent across Yahoo and Google's internal networks. The project, referred to as Muscular, was operated by GCHQ and offered "large international access located in the United Kingdom", according to the slide. Companies such as Google have multiple data centres worldwide to share the load of the vast amount of traffic generated daily, making it easier and quicker for consumers to access the data they want. "The allegations are that the spooks are able to get inside these networks, decode the information and reap the benefits," said Prof Sommer. "The UK is a good place to do it because London and Manchester are huge hubs for telecom and internet data," he said. </body>

      <title>'123456' tops Adobe password list</title>
      <description>The number sequence '123456' was the most popular password among Adobe users exposed by a security breach, suggests analysis</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24821528</url>
      <date>1383659929</date>

      <body>"123456" was the most popular password among the millions of Adobe users whose details were stolen during an attack on the company. About 1.9 million people used the sequence, according to analysis of data lost in the leak. Online copies of the data have let security researchers find out more about users' password-creating habits. The analysis suggests that many people are making it easy for attackers by using easy-to-guess passwords. On 4 October, Adobe reported that its systems had been penetrated by attackers who had stolen the online credentials for millions of its users. Early reports suggested about 2.9 million records had been compromised. On 30 October, this figure was revised, with Adobe saying information about 38 million active users had gone astray. In total, information about more than 150 million accounts was stolen - but many of the other accounts were disused, abandoned or duplicates. Adobe has now shut down all the compromised accounts, saying it will only reopen them once passwords have been changed. Copies of the data that was exposed by the breach have begun circulating online and inspired security researcher Jeremi Gosney to go through it working out which password was most popular. Top of the list, with 1.9 million entries, was the "123456" string of numbers. Second was the slightly longer "123456789" sequence. Other popular easy-to-guess passwords included "adobe123", "qwerty" and "password". Mr Gosney said the results of the analysis should be treated with caution because, so far, no-one had access to the keys that Adobe used to encrypt the data. However, he added, flaws in the way Adobe had stored and encrypted passwords along with clues in the giant file of data had made it possible to draw up a list that he was "fairly confident" was accurate. Computer security researchers who study password-creating habits have also seized on the data dump as a way to refine the word lists they use to attack login systems in a bid to make them more secure. Lists of passwords and email addresses are a boon to attackers not just because they can be used to get access to the systems they were supposed to secure. Many people re-use the same password for different services potentially giving attackers a way into other networks. </body>

      <body>More than 100 Britons were among 1,000 men caught trying to pay a computer-generated child to perform sex acts online, after a Dutch children's charity set up a fake profile. Terre des Hommes carried out a 10-week sting near Amsterdam, posing on video chat rooms as "Sweetie", a 10-year-old Filipina girl. Some 20,000 men contacted her, with 1,000 found to have offered her money. The names of these men - including 110 Britons - were passed to police. When I visited the charity's operations room - in a warehouse on the outskirts of Amsterdam - I watched as a researcher logged on to a chat room as Sweetie - incredibly life-like but created by a computer. Within seconds, like sharks, men were circling. Of the 1,000 men who were willing to pay Sweetie to take off her clothes in front of a webcam, 254 were from the US, followed by 110 from the UK and 103 from India. Researchers used evidence including profiles on Skype and social media to identify the suspects. Project director Hans Guyt told a news conference in the Hague on Monday that the crime "requires a new way of policing". "The predator won't come forward. The victim won't come forward," he said. "We identified ourselves as 10-year-old Filipino girls. "We did not solicit anything unless it was offered to us." Terre des Hommes has launched a global campaign to stop "webcam sex tourism". Managing director, Albert Jaap van Santbrink, said: "Our worst-case scenario is that the same will happen with this phenomenon as with child pornography, which is now a multi-billion industry in the hands of criminal gangs." The charity has now handed over its findings to police and has said it will provide authorities with the technology it has developed. But European policing agency Europol has expressed reservations about the findings. "We believe that criminal investigations using intrusive surveillance measures should be the exclusive responsibility of law enforcement agencies," spokesman Soren Pedersen told the Reuters news agency. Andy Baker, of the UK's National Crime Agency, also said that "tackling child sex abusers is best left to specialist law enforcement agencies". But he praised the campaign, saying it had "widened awareness of a global child sex abuse threat". "Working with our international law enforcement partners, we will now look at the information being passed on by Terre des Hommes," he added. Sweetie will not be used again. She has done her job - showing the predators that they can easily become prey. </body>

      <body>A crowd-funding campaign to bring back clay character Morph for an online series has reached its target after eight days. Aardman Animations set up the £75,000 campaign on Kickstarter to help fund 12 new one-minute episodes. Morph was one of the first characters created by the company that later brought us Wallace and Gromit. Aardman co-founder Peter Lord said he was "humbled" and "terribly grateful" to all of their new backers. The campaign reached its 22 days ahead of schedule after 1,690 fans pledged amounts ranging from £1 to £5,000 in support. Lord said he was "completely amazed" by the reaction to the campaign to bring Morph back, which reached its target . "I had no sense that it might run this fast. There's a lot of affection out there, from a lot of people over a lot of years, because he's been going a long time," Lord said about the strength of feeling towards the character - named after his "metamorphosing capabilities". "There are people kind of my age, that watched it with their kids a long time ago and then there are the children and grandchildren of them. A lot of people have come to like him." Aardman hope to start production on the new episodes, and "get the Plasticine warmed up" in January. Lord said he hoped the success of the campaign would mean they could extend the project. "I think we can afford to keep on funding our half, so I guess the obvious thing is to make more episodes," he said. "I have to work out all the maths, but if we can make 15, if we can make 20, that would suit me down to the ground because that's the fun part for me." The Kickstarter project will remain open for the full 30-day funding period until 28 November for further pledges. Those who contribute are eligible to receive various rewards, including a DVD of all the episodes made and a box of clay from Aardman's model making department. They can also contribute story ideas for Morph episodes, although Lord admits he "can't help" thinking of his own. "I do think new technology will be fun, and a smartphone will be a great prop for Morph," he suggested. "In the past he's done surreal stuff where he had a picture frame and you raise the question, is that a portal to another world? I think you can do the same thing with the smartphone, getting stuck inside, I can imagine that." Lord continued: "Because him and his brother, or arch enemy or alter ego Chas are always squabbling, there might be some comedy to be got from the fact that one of them has a really rather old mobile. A phone duel, that sort of thing." </body>

      <body>A robot developed by Japanese scientists is so fast it can "win" the rock-paper-scissors game against a human every single time. The Janken robot - named after the game's Japanese name - is a faster version of one unveiled by University of Tokyo researchers in June 2012. Version two completes its chosen hand shape almost at the same time as the human hand. It uses high-speed recognition and reaction, rather than prediction. Technically, the robot cheats because it reacts extremely quickly to what the human hand is doing rather than making a premeditated simultaneous action as the rules state. Taking just one millisecond (ms) - a thousandth of a second - to recognise what shape the human hand is making, it then chooses a winning move and reacts at high speed. Version one completed its shape 20ms after the human hand; version two finishes almost simultaneously. The scientists at the Ishikawa Oku Laboratory, part of the University of Tokyo, specialise in a range of technologies, including "sensor fusion", which aims to replicate and improve upon the human senses using high-speed intelligent robots. But Sethu Vijayakumar, professor of robotics at Edinburgh University, told the BBC: "These robots are really fast at reaction, but there are scenarios where even a millisecond's delay is not acceptable, such as accident avoidance or virtual stock markets. "In these cases we need to combine high-speed reaction with high-speed prediction, using game theory and behaviour patterning." </body>

      <body>Kate Russell's weekly review of the best apps and websites. This week we take a look at some data visualisation tools that might help you understand your social networks a little more. Mentionapp connects to Twitter and lets you explore how users are linked to each other by the hashtags they use. Facebook fans can try Friend-wheel - an interesting visualisation that shows all the connections between your friends - you might be surprised to learn who knows who. And for all you LinkedIn fans, there is a visualisation tool that lays bare a colour-coded map of your contacts to see how they are all interlinked on this enormous business network. As well as being a social space, the web is great if you like to create and Sketchtoy serves up a fun platform for any freehand artists to try their hand and making something lovely in a wibbly-wobbly drawing style that is quite hypnotic. Another interesting sharing app which is available free on Apple and Android is Chirp.io. This unique system uses a burst of sound - a bit like birdsong - to transmit the data required to share an image to any phones using the app within hearing range. A burst of chirp and the image instantly appears on the other phone. Music fans should set a reminder for a first this weekend. YouTube - the site that made Justin Bieber famous - is launching its own music awards. The event will be headlined by Lady Gaga and streamed live on 3 November 2013.

A Tesco spokesperson said the technology does not use facial recognition software, have eyeball scanners, record data or identify customers in any way - it simply estimates age and gender. Technology expert Tom Cheesewright told BBC Radio 5 live's Richard Bacon: "So much of this stuff happens today online already and you don't even know it. People will accept it as long as they get rewarded by it - if you see an interesting advert rather than one that bores you." </body>

      <title>Twitter: It's worth how much?!</title>
      <description>How do you value a company like Twitter?</description>

      <body>Twitter's much-anticipated launch on to the markets is fizzing with fanfare and debate over how - given that it has never made money - the microblogging site, priced at $26 per share, is officially worth more than $18bn (£11bn). The facts seem to contradict themselves. Twitter's growth is slow, and it shows no sign of making a profit - its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier. And more than half of its total registered users don't even use it. But some analysts predict that in the months post-share sale, the seven-year-old company's worth will increase to $20bn and beyond. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than double the likes of global carmaker Fiat, with its very modest-sounding market capitalisation of 6.9bn euros ($9.3bn). But Twitter is not alone in its sector when it comes to big price tags, if not profits. Online "scrapbooking" website Pinterest was valued at $3.8bn in October after its latest round of investment, giving it the same value, in terms of market capitalisation, as the UK's second largest house-builder Barratt Homes. Yet while Barratt has reported a full-year pre-tax profit of £192m for 2012-13, Pinterest has never made any money. Its digital "pinboards" may be attracting users, there may be talk of advertisers paying for posts, but it has no revenue yet. So why do these social media companies have this value attached to them? Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told the BBC it was a bit like buying a house. "You look at what other people are paying for something a little bit like what you are buying," he said. "[But] you have to think about whether you are going to price [the company] or value it." Twitter, Mr Damodaran believes, is being priced by bankers and brokers - not valued - and that pricing is coming from comparing it to its peers. By this he means that value is something more complex and emotional, but that pricing is based on at-the-time comparisons. Most notably, with Facebook. "The big difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook was making money [when it launched its IPO in 2012] and Twitter is losing money," said Mr Damodaran. Facebook had a billion active users when it launched its shares. While Twitter is growing its user base rapidly - up 39% over the past year to 500 million - only 232 million of these are active each month. According to a recent report by analysts Pew Internet, 72% of internet users in the US use social networking sites, but just 18% use Twitter. Plus, while users are invited to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters, many do not engage on the platform at all, leaving their registered accounts dormant. Others prefer to simply follow news feeds and favourite celebrities instead. This can cut the amount of time people spend on the site, and in turn the opportunities for advertisers to catch their attention. Facebook's IPO famously ran far from smoothly, and its shares quickly halved in price, before recovering slowly over the next two years. "Twitter is also entering a more crowded market than Facebook," said Mr Damodaran, "and there are many more queuing up to join." Therefore, he added, Twitter should be valued at about $10-15bn. He wrote recently that "at $20 billion, it is a moon shot". Chris Orndorff, who manages billions of dollars for clients at Los Angeles-based Western Asset Management, believes value is a lot to do with cash flow. "One of the best ways to value a company is to figure out the present value of the cash flows," he said. "For a more mature company, this is easier to do because they have a history of earnings, and generally reliable predictions about future earnings and cash flows. "Relatively new companies do not have the history." Therefore, he added, the stock was more likely to be volatile. "The susceptibility of social media companies to changes in consumer tastes also makes valuing those companies much more challenging," he said. Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of the travel website Lastminute.com, told the BBC she was confident Twitter could make money and hold its value. "Yes it is a scrabble for revenue," she said, but the company "has an astonishing amount of money in the bank". Advertising income from mobiles, rather than desktop computers, now accounts for over 70% of advertising revenue, and here, believes Ms Lane Fox and others, Twitter may be able to flourish. She also predicted "a huge number of interesting deals and partnerships" that could boost it further. A lot of the "value" or pricing of these companies depends on a future demand for services, as well as possible advertising streams. But, as past deals demonstrate - that future isn't always predictable. Famously, ITV bought the website Friends Reunited for £175m in 2005, but in 2009 Brightsolid paid ITV just £25m for the site. It had been superseded. Its "value" had been eroded. Its customers, the key to any company, had, in large numbers, moved on. Similar problems were encountered at one of the early social media pioneers, MySpace. In 2005 News Corp purchased MySpace for $580m. When it was sold in 2011, its price tag had fallen to a reported $35m. It too had been overtaken, and users abandoned its offering. But, for San Francisco-based CBS technology analyst Larry Magid, these cautionary tales make the newer clutch of technology companies stronger. "MySpace is a constant reminder that a high and mighty service can lose its lustre. However, the lessons of MySpace were not lost on Facebook, Twitter and services that followed," he said. "I think the difference [now] is the execution and the demographics. To succeed, Twitter needs a diversified audience that transcends a particular demographic. MySpace was focused on youth - a particularly fickle audience." Mr Damodaran said: "A lot of very valuable companies today - including Google - were once small, money-losing companies." And Mr Orndorff agreed: "The valuation is reasonable if the company can continue to grow its user base, generate cash flow from advertising, and successfully fend off the competition. If not, then it will be remembered - or forgotten - like many of the 1998-99 tech bubble companies, and generate plenty of tax losses for investors." </body>

      <title>Ways to plan a hi-tech wedding</title>
      <description>Ways to plan a technology-packed ceremony</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24759238</url>

      <body>Anyone taking a casual stroll around the average wedding fair could be forgiven for thinking that here is a ceremony whose technology has not been updated since the days of Jane Austen. When you consider that the industry is worth more than £10bn a year in the UK alone, you would think the tech giants would be eager to give it a makeover. Instead it is smaller-scale pioneers who are making the in-roads into a sector where tradition still reigns supreme. The BBC asked bride-to-be Ella Williamson to discover how hi-tech a wedding can become. Over the past year, fashion and technology have fused like never before. We've seen the model Dita von Teese step out in the world's first 3D-printed dress and singer Nicole Sherzinger perform in an outfit showing tweets via LED lights threaded into its fabric. So, is it possible to purchase a bridal gown that displays well wishes from loved ones? CuteCircuit, the company behind the Twitter Dress, confirms it would take on such a commission. But its chief creative director suggests a more subtle concoction. "We have made wedding outfits using conductive silver fabric that create a connection when the marrying couple kiss, triggering a private message on the linings of their garments," says Francesca Rosella. The time-honoured ritual of wearing a hat to a wedding has undergone a technological revamp too. Belgian 3D-printing firm i.materialise dabbled with headwear when it launched a millinery competition for designers last year. It now offers two services for creating bespoke headgear - collaborate with one of the company's recommended designers or alternatively design your own and then have it made in the lab. The company's community officer, Tatiana de Wee, adds that 3D-printed "wedding rings, engagement rings and wedding cake toppers" are available too. Merging the virtual world and the real world is an innovative way of getting guests to save the date. So, printing firms have started to offer augmented-reality-enhanced products, allowing invitations to come to life. The process is straightforward - record a one-minute video and send the MP4 file to the company to incorporate it. By holding a smartphone or tablet over the card, the guests can then view a personal message from the bride and groom. Advocates for the tech have claimed it has been about to take off for years - but one of the businesses involved insists the wedding industry is ripe for an AR revolution. "After a slow start 18 months ago, augmented reality printing is now proving popular thanks to increased smartphone ownership, 4G networks and advertising campaigns," Chris Hughes, managing director at Stuprint.com, tells the BBC. No tech wedding is complete without at least one robot. At least Japanese couple Tomohiro Shibata and Satoko Inoue thought so. Their ceremony in 2010 was conducted by i-Fairy, a £46,000 robot by Kokoro. But in 2014, getting married by an automaton should become more affordable thanks to the launch of Oscar the WeddingBot. Oscar is a 2ft (61cm) robot intended to be an officiant, pageboy, usher or speech giver. It uses an Arduino computer as its brain, features a text-to-speech module to talk and a high-definition video camera to see, while the hands were salvaged from a broken Kinderbot toy. "After I completed my first home-made robot in 2012, my friends Mark and Sarah joked about having him at their wedding," says Minneapolis-based inventor Jon Shmig. "I told them I'd make a custom robot and as the list of features expanded I realised that other people may be interested in his services." A prototype was used as a ring bearer at a ceremony in August, and Mr Shmig says he hopes to make the final version available for hire in the US early next year. He adds it will be able to move in time to music - so, be careful that he doesn't cut in to your first dance. With 50,000 downloads in eight weeks alone, Brazil's Boyfriend Tracker app has shown many people want to know their partner's movements. The software secretly sends GPS location and SMS updates about a handset's whereabouts. This begs the question - when will a GPS chip-enabled wedding ring come to market? US engineer Benjamin Kokes has created an engagement ring for his fiancee that features embedded LEDs that illuminate when in close proximity to a specially designed transmitter. But he has doubts about adding a Find My Spouse feature. "I would not rely specifically on GPS - with current technology you couldn't pack enough battery into the ring to have any useful operation," he says. Instead he suggests including a radio frequency identification (RFID) tag, which could be detected by strategically placed reader units. For less suspicious but more forgetful nearly-weds, Alaska Jewelry is developing the Remember Ring. The piece of jewellery, which is still at the concept stage, promises to self-heat 24 hours before your anniversary as a reminder. A built-in micro-thermopile would convert the heat from the wearer's hand into electricity to keep its tiny battery charged and its clock running. "We've received quite a bit of interest," says Alaska's Cleve Oines. "But we probably would not launch a GPS ring as GPS trackers and wedding rings are on opposite sides of the sentiment spectrum." If gadget shopping has left you little time to plan the rest of the celebrations, the web can again come to the rescue. American wedding planner TheKnot.com held what's thought to be the first crowdsourced wedding in New York on Valentine's Day this year. Members of the public voted online to select each element of the day - from the outfits to the Modern Ice Castle wedding theme. And if that doesn't sound ideal, you can always Photoshop the pictures. </body>

      <description>Beck, Arcade Fire and the music videos inviting fans in</description>

      <body>Picture the scene: you're at home watching the latest concert by your favourite musician. The crowd is raving, the singer approaches them holding the microphone out and a few people climb past security onto the stage. But alas, stuck in front of your computer screen, you can't join them. Except now you can - if you're a fan of American musician Beck, that is. He is one of a few artists making interactive music videos requiring fan participation. Throughout his 20-year career the industry has seen many changes, including more people now watching music videos on YouTube than on MTV. Beck has made many memorable music videos, though he started out with limited means. "[For] my first video we had no money," he says. "I had a friend who had film in the freezer left over from film school and we used that one roll of film. "Every frame was precious." The video in question was for his hit song Loser, which went on to sell half a million copies and became one of the defining singles of the 1990s. "I was surprised when some of these videos actually got played," he continues about his early releases. "Most of them were just friends who were making them and editing them." Since then the 43-year-old has collaborated with acclaimed directors such as Spike Jonze and Michael Gondry on his music videos. Earlier this year he took this one step further, developing a 360 degree experience with director Chris Milk. In Hello Again viewers can join Beck onstage or stroll around among the 170 musicians as they play David Bowie's Sound and Vision. Viewers move around by turning on their computer's webcam and moving their heads in the direction they want to move in. For Beck, music videos can create a strong connection between bands and fans in the digital age. "I grew up in an era where the packaging was such a big part of how you related to the music," he says. The cover of Psychocandy, the first Jesus and Mary Chain album, which has a bold design and stark red, white and black colour scheme, had an especially strong influence on how he related to the band and came to understand them. "It gave me enough information, it opened up a whole idea about where this music is coming from and what it was." He believes music videos can fulfil this role in today's digital era where there is less emphasis on physical records. "I felt that they were album artwork come to life," he says about these videos. The Google Creative Lab's Aaron Koblin has directed several interactive music videos. The 31-year-old heads the data arts team and grew up in the era of big budget videos which played a large role in teen culture, but says the fan was passive. "When I used to watch music videos it was very much 'I am receiving the content which is helping me understand and create a picture of the musician's identity'," he says. "But it didn't necessarily make me feel all that much closer." He thinks interactive web-based videos enable a new way of creating that bond. He has worked with Arcade Fire on videos that require fans to interact with the band. "I hope we can create a deeper emotional experience which will then help bring a better connection," he says. Together with director Vincent Morisset, he aimed to do just that with the Just A Reflektor project, which uses the title track from Arcade Fire's latest album. Fans connect their smartphone to their webcam via a unique code on the video's site. By moving their smartphone around viewers can change the visual effects on the video, creating sprinkles of light and colour. They also can guide the protagonist on her journey and eventually join her. "Your phone and computer are actually talking to each other," Mr Koblin says. "The computer is observing and talking about the phone's location and movement and in doing that is able to construct and change the story based around the way the phone is being moved around." While videos are increasingly being viewed on the internet, interactive web-based ones are still rare. Just A Reflektor uses new code and tools, that were specifically created for the Google Chrome browser. "These things aren't that easy to make yet," Mr Koblin explains. Creating these new tools is currently the most expensive part of making these videos. "That's part of why when we create them we're releasing a lot of the code that we used and a lot of the tools that we created so we can encourage other people to get involved." Arcade Fire have tried the interactive experience before in another experiment for Google Chrome. The song We Used To Wait was used by Mr Koblin and Mr Milk to become the interactive experience The Wilderness Downtown, which uses Google Earth to bring a new dimension to the song. Viewers type in their home address and will see images of where they grew up within the video. Jordan Gauthier is an Arcade Fire fan and says their interactive videos have strengthened his relationship with the band. He grew up in the French suburban town of Rennes and says The Wilderness Downtown made him relate to the song in a new way by helping him recall his childhood memories. "It's like putting your own memories into the video," he says. "I thought that was amazing." Ultimately Beck thinks the web opens up numerous possibilities to interact with fans. "I think that's an infinite idea," he says. "That kind of idea is going to spread because the technology exists." He points to the success of crowdfunding in other fields and thinks more videos will source their ideas and materials from fans in the future. Mr Koblin and Mr Milk crowdsourced for The Johnny Cash Project, which features the song Ain't No Grave. Released after Cash's death, the interactive site pays tribute to him through a video made up of stills drawn by fans. Viewers can then select and watch the frames in different orders. As material is continuously being added to the project, every viewing is unique. Crowdsourcing can also build closer bonds between fans themselves, according to British director Ninian Doff. He crowdsourced images of fans dancing to make the video for Graham Coxon's What It'll Take. One hundred fans sent in videos from 28 countries, and Mr Doff cut up all the videos for the final piece. "It's a big jumble," he explains. "Sometimes it's one person's legs and another person's top half, or it's one person's legs, one person's body, one person's head. "It's like making a Frankenstein out of fans' bodies." And people managed to find themselves and each other through leaving comments about the video online. "One person commented saying, 'Oh that's me at 2 minutes 5 seconds'," Mr Doff says. "Then another person replied, 'I'm your legs at 2 minutes 5 seconds'. "They'd managed to meet over the internet through being connected in the video." </body>

      <body>No-one knows exactly who is behind them, but in towns, villages and cities right across the UK, "Spotted In" Facebook pages are springing up - offering a kind of local information, dating site, and lost and found service all rolled into one. From big cities and towns like Cardiff and Reading, to the small village of Grampound in Cornwall, these sites are increasingly popular. In many places, more than one in 10 people are following their local "Spotted In" site. Almost all have been set up within the past year. The posts are a dizzying splash of late night post-pub sprawls, people shopping in pyjamas, and information about firework displays - all rolled up in typically British humour. Popular posts on the Spotted in Andover site include a cat found in bin - who became known locally as "Bin Cat" or "Stealth Pussy" - and the "so bad it's good" local rapper video (which spurred its own parody). Lost pets, wallets and ID are more regular fare - as is online flirting. "There are lots of happy endings... We are still waiting for our first engagement and wedding. It will happen though!" Some Spotted sites deal with serious subjects too. Spotted in Ipswich - which has more than 13,000 likes - was the first to expose a local man who claimed to have terminal cancer as a fraud. Also hugely popular are sites like Spotted on a Bus, Spotted on the Train, and Spotted on the Road. Some Spotted sites have had problems with bullying and harassment and have closed down - the most successful ones operate strict house rules and are carefully moderated. "It's almost like a forum for the town," says the admin of Spotted in Chippenham - who admits that being privy to the Wiltshire town's most "juicy secrets" is one of the perks of running the site. "Just to hear people say 'Did you see that on Spotted last night' is brilliant. My mum often talks about it and so does most of Chippenham." Spotted in Chippenham - like other sites - though is run anonymously. Not even his mum knows. Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <body>Back in the 1970s, Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak, and the rest, if you like, is history. The two became firm friends and although Steve Jobs often gets the credit for Apple's success, it was Woz, as he's known, who was the brains behind the silicon. He spoke to the BBC's technology programme Click. Computers are on the verge of understanding human gestures and speech, but it has not yet been perfected. Wozniak says he often finds Android human speech recognition software is more accurate than Apple's Siri. "Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is. And very often usually I find out that Android does." Wozniak says this is due to Android's access to Google's search engine. "That is actually the future of intelligence probably for computers getting smarter and getting artificial intelligence. I wish to God that Apple and Google were partners in the future." But how likely would a partnership between the two companies be? "I don't know. If I were there, it would be pretty likely. I'm probably wrong, there's probably an awful lot I don't know about the business concerns and one thing you've got to remember is a company has always got to make money," says Wozniak. Encouraging openness and sharing information and methods would benefit everyone to develop the best technology, Wozniak says. "I believe you should have a world where you've got to license something at a fair price. There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone. I wish Apple would use them and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us," he says. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology, all our products would be better, we'd go further. I do wish they were more compatible." Wozniak believes more sharing between companies would lead to developments in bigger and better technology in wearable tech, like smartwatches and augmented reality glasses. "I want a full smartphone-like capability on my wrist. The trouble is the more I think about it, I don't want the small size. "We're just at the verge of having products that have foldability and flexibility," he says. "For about three or four years I've been talking about organic LED displays that could be theoretically printed on plastic, wrapped and folded," he says. "But think outside of the box. It could be on the inside of your arm and then when you flip your arm up it could actually flip open into your own hand." Despite his legacy, Wozniak is not seen as an Apple insider these days. But he is still beloved by many of the Mac faithful. "His comments aren't influential in any shape or form. He was one of the founders of Apple and walked away, so the fan boys love him. He is free to say anything he likes," says Stuart Miles, founder of technology news website Pocket-lint. "I don't think he has any insight or influence into the inner workings of how Apple works. But nonetheless he is a fascinating storyteller," he says.

      <title>Facebook beheading: Who was the woman?</title>
      <description>Who was Mexico's Jane Doe?</description>

      <body>A film of a woman being beheaded in Mexico caused an international outcry in October when Facebook refused to remove it from its site. There have been hundreds of reports about the video - but why has no-one identified the victim in it? In the grainy footage, the woman is on her knees in jeans and a pink top, before a masked man holding a knife behind her says in a gruff voice: "Well, gentleman, this is what happens to all those in the Gulf Cartel. On behalf of Los Zetas." The rest of the video is a gruesome 40 seconds of cold-blooded murder, which caused international controversy recently when it was posted on Facebook. "Irresponsible" was the word used by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, about the social network's policy permitting the video to be uploaded. After a day or so of impassioned debate on both sides, Facebook reversed its decision and took the video down. Needless to say, it is still easy enough to find online, especially in Mexico. There are numerous websites dedicated to uploading videos of "narco-killings" or executions similar to the Facebook example. Yet despite the fact the victim is clearly identifiable and that presumably someone somewhere in Mexico must recognise her - as their wife, daughter or sister - no-one has come forward to name her. As far as the BBC has been able to ascertain, there is no investigation under way in Mexico to establish the woman's identity, or find the culprits of her murder. "The place to start [such an investigation] is with the municipal police," says Dr George Grayson, one of world's authorities on Los Zetas and author of the book, The Executioner's Men, about the criminal organisation. The problem, he says, is that although many municipal police officers may work for the public during the day - and sometimes even that is questionable - at night they work for the cartel. As such, he says, fear is a powerful tool used by both the Zetas and their rivals. "People are reluctant to report crimes, even heinous crimes. State forces are not much better in terms of their corruption and their collaboration with the cartels." Meanwhile, the unfortunate lady in the controversial film continues to be nameless and with no known identity - a "Jane Doe", reminiscent of dozens, perhaps hundreds of others who met a grisly end on camera in Mexico. In the case of the Facebook victim, one is faced with an even more basic problem when trying to identify her. Based on the non-descript wasteland in the video clip, it is almost impossible to establish where in Mexico she was killed and therefore which local authorities are responsible for investigating her murder. In essence, the act could have happened almost anywhere in the country where there is drug-related violence. Los Zetas' and Gulf Cartel's areas of influence, Oct 2013 QandA: Mexico's drug-related violence Stratfor: Cartel influence map "This gets to the heart of one of Mexico's biggest dramas - and that's the issue of investigation," says newspaper columnist, Julian Andrade, who has also published a number of books on the drug war. "Remember that statistics show we have a 96-98% rate of impunity. The majority of crimes are never going to be investigated here in Mexico. This is the profound problem - that even high profile cases like this one which make an impact in the world's media still reflect the incapacity of the authorities to carry out investigations." The BBC was due to interview the National Security Commissioner in Mexico, Manuel Mondragon, to pose questions about security and the investigation into the beheading which appeared on Facebook. Despite repeated requests, the security commissioner's office has still not granted us an interview or made any comment on the video. It may be the case, of course, that the woman in the film was deeply entrenched in the drug war as an active member of the Gulf Cartel, as her killer intimated before the attack. But George Grayson says it is almost impossible to know for sure what her supposed crime against Los Zetas was. "Often these ghoulish events take the form of settling scores against someone who has offended Los Zetas or is in conflict with Los Zetas," he says. It's possible she was just a relative or friend of a member of a rival drug gang, and was killed for revenge. He recounts a story he has written about in the past in which a woman in Nuevo Laredo, said to be an informant, was allegedly beaten to death by the sadistic former leader of Los Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino or "Z-40", in front of an assembled group of corrupt policemen, sending out a clear message not to cross the cartel. "Twenty to 25 years ago, women were involved in the narco-trade but you typically didn't kill women. Now all the rules have changed and the Zetas have been the main impulse in changing the rules." Despite the reams of words written about the Facebook beheading video, seemingly no-one asked the basic question, "Who was this woman?" If her execution is now considered so normal in today's Mexico that it doesn't even merit an investigation, in the final analysis, it is perhaps this - rather than any decision by Facebook - that is the most "irresponsible" element of this brutal killing.

      <body>A crowd-funding campaign to bring back clay character Morph for an online series has reached its target after eight days. Aardman Animations set up the £75,000 campaign on Kickstarter to help fund 12 new one-minute episodes. Morph was one of the first characters created by the company that later brought us Wallace and Gromit. Aardman co-founder Peter Lord said he was "humbled" and "terribly grateful" to all of their new backers. The campaign reached its 22 days ahead of schedule after 1,690 fans pledged amounts ranging from £1 to £5,000 in support. Lord said he was "completely amazed" by the reaction to the campaign to bring Morph back, which reached its target . "I had no sense that it might run this fast. There's a lot of affection out there, from a lot of people over a lot of years, because he's been going a long time," Lord said about the strength of feeling towards the character - named after his "metamorphosing capabilities". "There are people kind of my age, that watched it with their kids a long time ago and then there are the children and grandchildren of them. A lot of people have come to like him." Aardman hope to start production on the new episodes, and "get the Plasticine warmed up" in January. Lord said he hoped the success of the campaign would mean they could extend the project. "I think we can afford to keep on funding our half, so I guess the obvious thing is to make more episodes," he said. "I have to work out all the maths, but if we can make 15, if we can make 20, that would suit me down to the ground because that's the fun part for me." The Kickstarter project will remain open for the full 30-day funding period until 28 November for further pledges. Those who contribute are eligible to receive various rewards, including a DVD of all the episodes made and a box of clay from Aardman's model making department. They can also contribute story ideas for Morph episodes, although Lord admits he "can't help" thinking of his own. "I do think new technology will be fun, and a smartphone will be a great prop for Morph," he suggested. "In the past he's done surreal stuff where he had a picture frame and you raise the question, is that a portal to another world? I think you can do the same thing with the smartphone, getting stuck inside, I can imagine that." Lord continued: "Because him and his brother, or arch enemy or alter ego Chas are always squabbling, there might be some comedy to be got from the fact that one of them has a really rather old mobile. A phone duel, that sort of thing." </body>

      <title>Bolshoi boss testifies at trial</title>
      <description>Bolshoi artistic director Sergei Filin describes having acid thrown in his face at the trial of a dancer accused of ordering the attack.</description>

      <body>The artistic director of Russia's Bolshoi ballet has described having acid thrown in his face during the trial of a dancer accused of ordering the attack. Sergei Filin, who suffered severe burns to his face and damage to his sight, spoke of a "terrifying pain". Pavel Dmitrichenko has denied arranging the assault in a case that revealed bitter infighting at the Bolshoi. Two other men are being tried with him over the attack in January. Mr Filin, 43, began his testimony on Wednesday by saying he was fair and transparent in distributing roles. But he said that Mr Dmitrichenko, 29, kept trying to find compromising material on him. He described the night of the assault, and how his attacker said "Here's a greeting for you" as he threw sulphuric acid in his face. "Suddenly I felt liquid, I felt a sudden pain, I had never experienced such pain," he said. "Terrifying pain, my eyes couldn't see." Mr Filin's highly anticipated court appearance came despite doctors' orders for him to avoid stress, according to AFP news agency. Prosecutors say Mr Dmitrichenko colluded with ex-convict Yuri Zarutsky, who has admitted throwing the acid at the ballet chief outside his home. Mr Zarutsky insists he acted alone. A third defendant, Andrei Lipatov, who is accused of driving the car used to transport the alleged attacker, has denied any part in the attack. If convicted, the three accused could be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison. Mr Dmitrichenko has been in custody since his arrest in March. Meanwhile, Mr Filin has undergone more than 20 operations on his eyes since the attack. Doctors in Germany have managed to partially restore his sight, but he will reportedly need further treatment. He was once star of Russia's renowned Bolshoi theatre, and in 2011 became the artistic director of the ballet troupe. The acid attack exposed vicious internal rivalries which eventually caused the dismissal of Bolshoi director Anatoly Iksanov. </body>

      <title>Star Wars movie to hold open casting</title>
      <description>Unprecedented open casting sessions are to be held for Star Wars: Episode VII around the UK and Ireland in November, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Open auditions are being planned for two lead roles in the next Star Wars film, the BBC has learned. The casting sessions for Star Wars: Episode VII will start later this week at locations around the UK and Ireland, including London, Dublin and Glasgow. According to a casting notice the film-makers are looking to fill two roles. They are a "street smart and strong" orphaned girl in her late teens and a "smart capable" man in his late teens or early 20s. The open auditions for a "major Hollywood Movie" were first published on the twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a "nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie". Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series, in October 2012. In the US open auditions also begin this week according to an online notice. Casting directors will be visiting cities including Nashville and Chicago as well as accepting online applications. Lucasfilm declined to comment to the BBC but it is likely the characters have been given non sci-fi names and descriptions in the announcement in an effort to disguise the auditions are for Star Wars: Episode VII. The broad nature of the characters is almost the same as in descriptions leaked online earlier in the year when the overall casting process began. While it is unprecedented for lead parts in a franchise of this size to hold open auditions in this way, Star Wars has in the past given major roles to little known actors and actresses through the traditional casting process, dating back to the original trilogy when the then unknown Mark Hamill won the role of Luke Skywalker. Other movies have successfully cast secondary actors and actresses through open auditions in the past most notably some of the later Harry Potter films. And actress Dakota Blue Richards won the lead role of Lyra in The Golden Compass, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, through open casting. Director JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the movie, will not be attending the open auditions which begin in Bristol on 9 November. Instead those at the auditions, who must be over the age of 16 for the female role, and over 18 for the male role, will briefly meet members of the casting team of the film. Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios in spring 2014, for an expected 2015 release. </body>

      <title>Korean festival brings hits to London</title>

      <body>The eighth London Korean Film Festival opens this week, offering UK audiences the chance to see a number of titles that have enjoyed unexpected box office success in their home country. They include festival opener Hide and Seek, a low-budget home invasion thriller that reached five million ticket sales in less than three weeks, despite having no established stars. Also on the line-up is The Flu, a disaster movie about an influenza epidemic that had a similarly strong reaction in South Korea last August. Secretly, Greatly - a comedy about North Korean spies stationed in the South that enjoyed the biggest opening weekend for a domestic release last June - is another crowd-pleaser to feature in the programme. The event will also screen Wish, whose dramatisation of a real-life child abuse case that became a cause celebre in South Korea saw it top the country's box office chart last month. The resurgence of home-grown product has not gone unnoticed, with Variety's Patrick Frater remarking this week that "things are looking up for Korean cinema". "This year has seen a succession of local stories that emerged from indie roots... films made by first or second-time directors... and pic[ture]s that became hits without recognisable stars," the journal's Asia correspondent said. Earlier this year, Screen Daily reported South Korea's box office hit a record high in the first half of 2013 with 98.5 million admissions. More than half of these admissions were for local films, a factor that led Variety to suggest Korean cinema was "on the cusp of a new golden era". Its prediction appears to be borne out by Snowpiercer, an ambitious sci-fi epic whose $40m (£24.8m) budget makes it the most expensive South Korean release ever. The English-language film, whose international cast includes Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt, has made almost $60m (£37m) in South Korea since opening in August according to Box Office Mojo. It has since opened in France on 300 screens - the widest release ever in that country for a Korean film. Where the film goes from there remains a moot point, though, amid reports the film is to be substantially cut before distribution worldwide. The launch of this year's London Korean Film Festival conveniently coincides with a state visit by Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president. The president's visit will include a special preview of Hide and Seek, to take place in London later ahead of the festival's official launch on Thursday. The South Korean leader was in Paris earlier this week and made a point of highlighting Snowpiercer as an example of cultural collaboration between her country and Europe. "It is my hope that such similar collaborations can take place in terms of cultural content and technology, and furthermore contribute to cooperative relations," she said on Monday. Her attendance later will bring an additional charge to an event that has some experience when it comes to attracting high-profile guests. Last year's closing night gala, for example, saw Bruce Willis, John Malkovich and Dame Helen Mirren come out in support for Korean actor Lee Byung-hun, with whom they were shooting action sequel Red 2 at the time. Following this year's events in London, the 2013 Korean Film Festival - which features no films from North Korea - will present highlights from its programme in Oxford, Bradford and St Andrews. It will, however, have to compete for audiences with other specialised showcases of international cinema that are running concurrently. The capital is also playing host to the UK Jewish Film Festival, which is holding events in London, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow until 17 November. This week also sees the launch of the 21st UK French Film Festival, which will bring a selection of Gallic offerings to London, Warwick and eight locations in Scotland until 7 December. </body>

      <title>Christie whodunit tops crime poll</title>
      <description>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd by Agatha Christie is the best crime novel ever written, according to a poll of her fellow crime writers.</description>

      <body>A 1926 whodunit by Agatha Christie has been named the best crime novel ever written by her fellow crime writers. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, one of the first Christie books to feature Belgian detective Hercule Poirot, topped a poll held to mark the 60th anniversary of the Crime Writers' Association (CWA). Christie herself was named best ever author, while the Sherlock Holmes cycle was named best ever crime series. Ten titles in all made the shortlist put before the body's 600 members. They included another Christie work - 1934's Murder on the Orient Express - as well as two novels by Raymond Chandler, The Big Sleep and The Long Goodbye. The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins and The Nine Tailors by Dorothy L Sayers had also been in contention. The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris (1988) and On Beulah Height by Reginald Hill (1998) were the most recent works to make the shortlist. However the CWA favoured classic crime fiction above more contemporary works. The Murder of Roger Ackroyd sees Poirot investigate the deaths of two residents of a small English village. The novel ends with an audacious revelation which is now considered one of the most ingenious plot twists in the history of crime writing. The poll coincides with what will be David Suchet's final TV appearance as Hercule Poirot, whom he first portrayed on television in 1989. Curtain - Poirot's Last Case, broadcast on ITV on 13 November, will be followed by Being Poirot, a documentary about the actor's experience of playing the famous moustachioed sleuth. It was announced in September the detective will return in an as yet untitled new novel, penned by the crime writer Sophie Hannah. </body>

      <title>Cruise denies 'abandoned' Suri claim</title>

      <body>Tom Cruise has dismissed claims he has "abandoned" his seven-year-old daughter Suri following his divorce from actress Katie Holmes as "patently false". "I have in no way cut Suri out of my life," he said in a declaration filed on Tuesday in a $50m (£31m) defamation case against magazine publisher Bauer. The 51-year-old is suing Bauer over two 2012 tabloid stories that claimed he was absent from his daughter's life. Cruise and Holmes divorced in June last year after six years of marriage. The legal action relates to stories in Life and Style and In Touch magazines that claimed overseas film shoots had stopped the actor being a constant presence in Suri's life. In documents made public by Radar Online, the star acknowledged he was "a professional actor in motion pictures" whose job involved "extended periods of time in various parts of the world". However, Cruise insisted he and his daughter remained "extremely close" and had a "wonderful relationship and cheerful phone calls". "While I'm sure my daughter misses me when I am not with her (as I miss her), she is a very happy child," the actor's statement read. Suri, he continued, "has never indicated, in words or substance, that she has ever felt abandoned by me". Cruise's lawyers are asking a judge to order Bauer to declare it did not have any sources to support its contentions. Bauer's lawyers have argued the star's motion should be rejected, referring to statements from confidential sources that allegedly support its claims. </body>

      <body>The family of one of two filmmakers killed in a 2012 helicopter crash in Australia has taken legal action against James Cameron's production company, Lightstorm Entertainment. Award-winning cameraman Mike deGruy was working on the Titanic director's documentary DeepSea Challenge. He and writer and producer Andrew Wight both died when the helicopter crashed and caught fire shortly after take-off. Mr deGruy's family are seeking unspecified damages from Lightstorm. Legal papers were filed at Los Angeles Superior Court on Monday. The legal papers also name Andrew Wight's estate, Robinson Helicopter Company, Cameron Pace Group and Earthship Productions as defendants, although Cameron himself is not named. The helicopter crashed on 4 February last year, on an airstrip near Nowra, New South Wales. Mr deGruy and Mr Wight, who was piloting the aircraft, were headed to Jervis Bay to film a specially equipped submarine. In the 45-page legal document, which can be viewed via Deadline Hollywood, the estate of Michael deGruy states that Wight noticed his side door was open when he was ten feet off the ground, and reached with his hand to close it before losing control of the aircraft. That papers claim the defendants should have known that Mr Wight "was incompetent or unfit to fly the subject helicopter". The wrongful death legal claim also adds that the helicopter, which caught fire after the fuel tank ruptured, "was not crashworthy and its design posed a risk of severe injury and/or death in the event of a crash." Mr deGruy had also worked with Cameron on his 2005 documentary, Last Mysteries of the Titanic, as the director of undersea photography. The Emmy and Bafta-winning cameraman had also contributed heavily to BBC series Life in the Freezer, The Trials of Life and Blue Planet. At the time of the crash, Cameron said in a statement: "Mike and Andrew were like family to me. They were my deep-sea brothers and both were true explorers who did extraordinary things and went places no human being has been." </body>

      <title>Stubbs kangaroo painting stays in UK</title>
      <description>18th century paintings of a kangaroo and a dingo by George Stubbs are saved for the nation by a final £1.5m donation, following an export bar in January.</description>

      <body>Two 18th century George Stubbs paintings, featuring a kangaroo and a dingo, are to stay in Britain after an appeal backed by David Attenborough. A £1.5m donation from shipping magnate Eyal Ofer has enabled the National Maritime Museum to buy the paintings. Commissioned after Captain James Cook's first Endeavour voyage, they were put under an export bar in January after being sold to a buyer outside the UK. They are the first known depictions of the Australian animals in Western art. Kongouro from New Holland and Portrait of a Large Dog were first exhibited together in London in 1773 and have remained in the UK ever since. Stubbs used sketches and specimens to create the paintings in the UK. Both paintings were privately owned until they were sold in late 2012, when they were put under an export bar because of their place in British history and artistic culture. Attenborough, who backed the nationwide Save Our Stubbs appeal, said it was "exciting news that these two pictures, so important in the history of zoological discovery, are to remain where they were commissioned and painted". A statement from the National Maritime Museum said it was "delighted" with the donation from the Eyal Ofer Family Foundation. Contributions from the Heritage Lottery Fund, the Monument Trust, the Art Fund and the public also helped the museum to purchase the paintings, which it says will "greatly enhance" its permanent collection. It already holds collections relating to Cook's three great voyages and these paintings will be central to a commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Cook's Endeavour voyage in 2018. The works will initially go on display in the historic Queen's House, which is part of the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, in summer 2014. The gallery space will be named The Eyal Ofer Gallery. The shipping magnate has supported numerous projects including the new building programme at Tate Modern and the Royal Row Barge Gloriana for Her Majesty's the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. "My family has a long connection with this great maritime institution and these paintings are a landmark in Britain's history of maritime exploration and Captain Cook's voyages," he said. The export licence deferral was placed on the pictures in January by Culture Minister Ed Vaizey, who said it was "great news" that the "strange and wonderful paintings will be available to be enjoyed by everyone for generations to come". </body>

      <title>Masters' unknown works in Nazi trove</title>
      <description>Previously unknown artworks by masters are among more than 1,400 pieces found in a trove of Nazi-looted art in Munich, German officials say.</description>

      <body>Previously unknown artworks by masters are among more than 1,400 pieces found in a trove of Nazi-looted art in Munich, German officials say. As slides of the paintings were shown at a news conference, an expert said the works had been seized from private individuals or institutions. Previously unregistered works by Marc Chagall, Otto Dix, Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse were found. Prosecutors said the issue of ownership was still being clarified. The total value has been estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Reinhard Nemetz, head of the prosecutors' office in Augsburg, said that 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works had been seized in the flat of Cornelius Gurlitt in Munich in March of last year. It was not yet clear if any offence had been committed, he added, stressing that the legal position was extremely complex. Investigators, he said, had turned up "concrete evidence" that at least some of the works had been seized by the Nazis from their owners or had been deemed "degenerate". Art expert Meike Hoffmann said some of the works were dirty but they had not been damaged. "When you stand before the works and see again these long-lost, missing works, that were believed destroyed, seeing them in quite good condition, it's an extraordinarily good feeling," Ms Hoffmann said. "The pictures are of exceptional quality, and have very special value for art experts. Many works were unknown until now." Other artists whose works were found include Pablo Picasso and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, as well as Canaletto and Gustave Courbet. The paintings were found in March of last year after Mr Gurlitt was investigated for tax evasion. The framed pictures were stacked on a shelf, like in a museum storeroom while the unframed works were piled up in drawers, said customs official Siegfried Kloeble. According to a report by Germany's Focus magazine, Mr Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich, would occasionally sell a picture when he needed money. "We don't have any strong suspicion of a crime that would justify an arrest," said Mr Nemetz, adding that the current whereabouts of Mr Gurlitt were unknown. Asked at the news conference why the German authorities had taken so long to reveal the paintings, the prosecutor said it would have been "counter-productive to go public" with the case earlier. Mr Kloeble refused to say where the artworks were being stored. Mr Gurlitt's father Hildebrand collected early 20th Century art regarded by the Nazis as un-German or "degenerate", and removed from show in state museums. He was recruited by the Nazis to sell the "degenerate art" abroad but also bought privately. After the war he told investigators that his collection had been destroyed during the Allied bombing of Dresden in 1945. He also said he had been persecuted himself for having a Jewish grandmother. Resuming his work as a dealer, he died in a car crash in 1956. A Jewish group has questioned the length of time it took Germany to unveil the artworks and called for them to be returned to their original owners. "It cannot be, as in this case, that what amounts morally to the concealment of stolen goods continues," said Ruediger Mahlo, speaking for the Conference on Jewish material claims against Germany. Stuart Eizenstat, a former US ambassador to the EU, told the BBC that time was running out, and the details of the artworks should be published. "Victims of the Holocaust are aging, even the families of those who did not survive are of an age," he said. "It's important that this be publicised. But the longer one goes... the more difficult it is for people to prepare potential claims... Justice delayed is justice denied." However, prosecutors say it would not be proper procedure to put things on the internet and people who want to make a claim should contact them directly. The BBC's Stephen Evans in Munich says that descendants of owners of art taken by German forces in occupied Europe may be able to make claims. However, there are suggestions that art taken in Germany itself may not be reclaimable because of a 30-year statute of limitations. Mr Mahlo said that private collections of such art under the Third Reich had been almost all Jewish. However, auctioneers have argued that at least some of the works were purchased cheaply in 1938 by Mr Gurlitt's father from a collection of state-owned art. In 1990, Cornelius Gurlitt auctioned works for 38,250 Swiss francs (31,000 euros) in Galerie Kornfeld, an auction house and gallery in the Swiss city of Bern. In a statement quoted by Reuters news agency, Galerie Kornfeld said: "Cornelius Gurlitt inherited the works after the death of his mother Helene. Basically this is a case of undeclared inheritance." </body>

      <body>Sadler's Wells plans to create a new venue it hopes will help establish London as a global centre for dance to rival New York and Paris. The search has begun for the site of the 500-seat theatre, which could open as early as 2018. Sadler's Wells' artistic director Alistair Spalding said the plan was a result of "frustration" with not having a medium-sized venue to stage work. "Dance is a really strong art form," he said. "We deserve proper spaces." Mr Spalding made the announcement on Tuesday as he unveiled a 10 Year Plan, which included investing £5 million in commissioning new dance work. "New York and Paris were seen as the leading centres of the art form. I believe that is no longer the case and my ambition is to make London the greatest centre for dance," he said. Fundraising for the new dance venue is due to begin in late 2014. Mr Spalding said the size of the new venue meant it would not make money, and would require some extra subsidy. He said it was too early to go into detail about the budget, but it was "not anywhere near" a suggested £100m. "The public appetite for dance has never been greater. We want to respond to this, and give the creative talent in this country a proper chance to develop for the future growth of the art form. "To achieve this, we need to be able to expand beyond our current base - without losing the unique quality and atmosphere that is associated with Sadler's Wells," Mr Spalding said. He said the new theatre would not be "luxurious", but "a contemporary space that young audiences will enjoy". The new theatre will work in tandem with Sadler's Wells' three existing theatres: The 1,500-seat main house and 150-seat Lilian Baylis Studio, in Islington, north London; and the 1,000-seat Peacock Theatre in the West End. Since its major, lottery-funded rebuild in 1998, more than 4.5 million people have visited Sadler's Wells. According to the new annual report, the dance house raised £23.8 million in 2012/13 and for every £1 of subsidy generated £10. Highlights of the 2014 Spring/Summer season include Tanztheater Wuppertal Pina Bausch, who visit in February with 1980, a rarely-performed piece by Pina Bausch; and Brasil Brasileiro, a World Cup-inspired show with 35 performers from Rio de Janeiro. </body>

      <title>Hunger Games sequel gets 12A rating</title>
      <description>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is rated 12A in the UK after censors passed it without cuts - unlike the first instalment.</description>

      <body>The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, the second instalment of the sci-fi film series, has been rated 12A after being passed uncut by censors. The BBFC report said the film contained "moderate violence and threat, and infrequent strong language". Cuts were made to the original Hunger Games film in 2012 in order to achieve a teen-friendly rating in the UK. The latest film, starring Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence, is out in the UK on 21 November. The BBFC report also revealed that the sequel, directed by Francis Lawrence, runs to 146 minutes and 2 seconds. The movie series is based on the best-selling trilogy of novels by Suzanne Collins. Set in a post-apocalyptic America where adolescents fight to the death on live TV, the cast includes Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Donald Sutherland. The first instalment of the franchise made £27.2m at the UK box office, and nearly $700 million (£441m) worldwide. It had faced a 15 certificate in the UK, until its distributor Lions Gate UK chose to make seven seconds of cuts - included the digital removal of "blood splashes" - in order to achieve a lower rating. "These cuts were made in addition to reductions already made following an earlier 'advice' viewing of an incomplete version," the BBFC noted at the time. In the US, The Hunger Games was rated PG-13 for "intense violent thematic material and disturbing images - all involving teens". Two further instalments in the series - both based on Collins' final novel The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - are due for release in November 2014 and November 2015. </body>

      <body>The Grand Budapest Hotel, the latest film from US writer and director Wes Anderson, will open the 2014 Berlinale film festival in February. The film's ensemble cast includes Ralph Fiennes, Bill Murray, Edward Norton, Tilda Swinton and Jude Law. Set in a famous European hotel between the wars, it tells the story of a stolen priceless painting and was partly filmed in Germany. Anderson's Moonrise Kingdom opened Cannes Film Festival in 2012. "With unmistakeable Wes Anderson charm, this comedy promises to kick things off in a big way," said Berlinale festival director Dieter Kosslick of Anderson's new film. Its world premiere will launch the 11-day event in Berlin on 6 February, the first major European film festival of the year. Three-time Oscar nominee Anderson has a large cult following thanks to films such as The Royal Tenenbaums, The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou and the stop-motion animation Fantastic Mr Fox, based on Roald Dahl's book of the same name. The British-German co-production also stars Mathieu Amalric, Adrien Brody, Owen Wilson, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Saoirse Ronan and Jason Schwartzman. The off-beat story follows the adventures of a legendary hotel concierge, played by Fiennes, and the bell boy who becomes his most trusted friend. It premiered its first trailer online last month. The Berlin Film Festival runs from 6 to 16 February 2014. </body>

      <body>Irene Kane, the female lead in Stanley Kubrick's 1955 film Killer's Kiss, has died in New York of pancreatic cancer. Kane, who later co-authored celebrity autobiographies under her married name Chris Chase, played a dancer who falls for a boxer in Kubrick's crime drama. The actress would later say it was "a silly movie" that had been made "with no money [and] no names". Kane, who died on 31 October, went on to appear on Broadway and on television before moving into journalism. According to the Hollywood Reporter, her family declined to confirm her age at the time of her death. The former model was married in 1962 to television producer Michael Chase, the son of Pulitzer-winning playwright Mary. She went on to co-author the autobiographies of actress Rosalind Russell, comedian Alan King and one-time First Lady Betty Ford. Kubrick, whose later films would include Dr Strangelove, 2001: a Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, died in 1999. </body>

      <title>Scorsese and Hockney honoured in LA</title>
      <description>Film director Martin Scorsese and artist David Hockney are honoured at a star-studded event in Los Angeles.</description>

      <body>Film director Martin Scorsese and artist David Hockney have been honoured at a star-studded event at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma). The pair were honourees at the museum's annual Art+Film Gala, designed to bring the two industries closer together. Scorsese was praised for helping to save the museum's film programme from being cut and for his work on film restoration. Hockney was recognised for the way he captured the city through his artwork. "I first arrived in Los Angeles, almost 50 years ago in January 1964, and they were just putting up this building," the 76-year-old, who lived in California for nearly three decades, said in a brief speech. "It's the only encyclopaedic museum in Southern California and deserves your support." The artist's Seven Yorkshire Landscape Videos exhibition - created by mounting cameras to a car while he drove through the countryside - is currently on show at Lacma. The gala raised $4.1m (£2.6m) for Lacma's film programme, which was first introduced in 1965, but was hit by the financial crisis in 2009 and was forced to stop its weekend screenings. At the time, Scorsese was a vocal critic of the move and wrote an open letter to museum director Michael Govan saying he was "deeply disturbed" at the decision. "Marty was very vocal when we announced that we were pausing our film programme a few years ago during the economic meltdown," Mr Govan said at the gala. "When he learned that we really wanted to rebuild and expand our programme, he was the first person who offered to help." Scorsese has been an advocate for film preservation and founded The Film Foundation in 1990 to help the cause. The Goodfellas director also presented the restoration of four films by French film-maker Agnes Varda at the gala and appealed for help in preserving film from the ravages of time. "What is cinema? For me there is only one answer. Cinema is necessary. Please don't forget it," he said. Stars at the event, hosted by Leonardo DiCaprio, included Tom Hanks, Drew Barrymore, James Franco and Warren Beatty, while Sting provided the night's entertainment. </body>

      <title>Perry album a bio-hazard down under</title>

      <body>Bio-security officers in Australia have been ordered to inspect any copies of Katy Perry's new album arriving into the country from overseas. The Department of Agriculture fears small packets of seeds given away with Prism could pose a risk to the country. The Australian release is believed to contain harmless locally-sourced seeds. However, the department told news.com.au that international versions are a "bio-security concern" and will be searched on arrival in the country. "The Australian government has a strong system in place to detect and respond to material of bio-security concern," said a spokesperson for the Department of Agriculture. "This includes the inspection of mail, cargo and baggage." The deluxe version of Perry's album Prism, which is currently number one in Australia's Aria chart, contains a small packet of seeds which the US singer encourages fans to plant. Her production company has assured officials that the Australian release contains Swan River daisy seeds from the west of the country, however fans can still purchase copies from abroad online. The US version is available for under $19 (£12) from eBay including shipping, according to Billboard.com, while the Australian version retails for $24.99 (£15). Australia's strict customs laws mean the US copies could be confiscated. "Seeds or plant material of international origin may be a weed not present in Australia or the host of a plant pathogen of bio-security concern," said a department spokesperson. They continued: "Our bio-security officers at international airports, seaports and mail centres assess the risks associated with various items every day and are well-trained in making informed decisions about whether items could be of bio-security concern." </body>

      <body>Belfast-based UTV Media plc has announced plans to launch a new TV channel in the Republic of Ireland. UTV Ireland Limited is to submit an application to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) for a contract later on Wednesday. The new channel would be based in Dublin with additional newsgathering and reporting presence in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick. UTV has said that it will create more than 100 jobs. In recent years, UTV have cut jobs from their news operation in Belfast, a cost-saving process that is continuing. It plans to put the new channel on air in early 2015. The announcement follows the signing of an agreement with ITV, which would give UTV broadcasting rights in the Republic for programmes like Coronation Street and Emmerdale. John McCann, group chief executive of UTV Media plc, said: "UTV Media already has a very strong presence in the Republic of Ireland employing more than 300 people in our various businesses including our market-leading Irish radio stations. "We look forward to building on that success with the launch of a new Irish TV channel." </body>

      <body>Actress Olivia Colman has confirmed she will star in the second series of the hugely successful ITV detective drama Broadchurch, reprising her role as detective sergeant Ellie Miller. The murder mystery gripped ITV viewers in April, with a peak audience of 8.9 million viewers. The drama about the death of an 11-year-old boy also won critical acclaim. Double Bafta-winner Colman said her return was "set in stone" but added she would not be in the US remake. Her Broadchurch co-star David Tennant is reportedly starring in the US version, which is expected to begin filming in January for broadcast on the Fox network during the 2014-2015 season. Colman, who is also currently filming the return of BBC Two comedy Rev, said how "lucky" she felt to be doing a wide range of roles. "I've always enjoyed my work and I'm lucky to be doing it - yes, I feel lucky," she said. She won two Baftas in May for her roles in Accused and Twenty Twelve. Colman and Tennant also won best actor and actress for Broadchurch at the Specsavers Crime Thriller Awards in October, while co-star Andrew Buchan was named best supporting actor. The series also took home the award for best TV programme. The drama is also being adapted into a novel, according to The Daily Telegraph, which said the rights have been bought by Little, Brown Book Group. Scriptwriter Chris Chibnall is said to be co-writing the book with British psychological thriller author Erin Kelly. The newspaper said it will be published in August 2014. </body>

      <title>Downton Abbey 'can help UK business'</title>
      <description>The popularity of the Royal Family and the TV drama Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers are told.</description>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <title>Byford: £1m BBC pay-off 'not greed'</title>
      <description>The BBC's former deputy director general defends his controversial £949,000 redundancy pay-off, telling BBC Radio 5 Live it was "not greed on my part at all".</description>

      <body>Mark Byford, the former deputy director general of the BBC, has defended a controversial pay-off package that saw him leave the BBC with £949,000. He told BBC Radio 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire: "I absolutely don't think it was greed on my part at all". Byford left the BBC in 2011 after being made redundant as part of a drive to cut the number of highly-paid senior executives at the BBC. He sidestepped questions about paying any of the money back. He said the pay-off was "properly approved" and added: "I absolutely think I've done no wrong." A report by the National Audit Office (NAO), released in July this year, criticised the BBC for paying out £25m in severance to 150 outgoing senior BBC managers - £2m more than their contracts stipulated. Byford's payment was revealed to be the highest at £949,000, after 32 years of service at the BBC. Byford, speaking to Derbyshire during an interview to promote his new book, admitted it was a large sum but said that he had not wanted to leave the corporation. "I lost my job, I was made redundant, I left when I was told to leave by the BBC. After 32 years of working there I was devoted to the corporation," said Byford. "It was a lot of money and it was in a context that I was the number two at the BBC and I'd served more than 30 years there. "It was in a context of being made redundant in a very big cull of senior management. I felt very strongly myself that it should touch every level including right at the very top." He continued: "I didn't want to go, I loved my job but I absolutely understood that if it [redundancy] touched me I would accept it." When Byford left the BBC in 2011 his pay-off was made up of 12 months' salary worth £474,500, with a further £474,500 pay in lieu of notice, despite the fact that he had stayed on to work on coverage of the Olympics and the royal wedding. He also received £73,000 for holiday he had not used since 2004. Former director general Mark Thompson, who oversaw Byford's payment, was questioned about the issue by MPs on the Public Accounts Committee in September this year. He told them that Byford's pay-off had represented "value for money" and denied current director general Tony Hall's claims that the BBC had "lost its way". Since taking up the job in April Lord Hall has introduced a cap on BBC severance payments of £150,000. When asked by Derbyshire if he deserved his payout, Byford said it was what had been approved by the "appropriate body" at the BBC, the remuneration committee. "I wasn't there, I took no part in it and I was given what I was given," he said. He added that he had not entered into any salary negotiations "since the day I joined the BBC aged 20 on a holiday job". In September, former BBC chairman Lord Grade defended Mark Byford's pay-off during an interview on BBC Newsnight, and said he was a "great asset to the BBC". Lord Grade also suggested that Byford could have prevented recent crises at the BBC, including the failure to broadcast a Newsnight investigation into sex abuse allegations against Jimmy Savile. However on Tuesday, Byford told Derbyshire it was impossible to say whether he would have handled things differently. "I don't think you or I can answer that with any sense of accuracy or insight, because I wasn't there," said Byford. "As part of my responsibilities [as ....of journalism at the BBC] the most complex and sensitive editorial issues would land on my desk. Whether those things would have been handled in a different way you just can't say." Byford also denied that he had ever heard rumours about Jimmy Savile during his career at the BBC. "I started at the BBC in 1979 at BBC Leeds, his home city, my home area of West Yorkshire. As you said, I stayed in the BBC for 32 years. I never heard any of those rumours or anecdotes or claims about sexual abuse on BBC premises," said Byford. He continued: "Obviously I'm as horrified, disgusted as any other individual or employee at what happened. Obviously the first and primary concern is about the victims of that abuse. "It's absolutely horrific. The BBC has got to learn those lessons and ensure that that kind of behaviour and incident can never ever happen again." </body>

      <description>James Arthur moves on from X Factor</description>

      <body>X Factor winner James Arthur talks about his mission to stay authentic, his dreams of working with Eminem and why he won't do media training. It's almost a year since he clinched victory from Jahmene Douglas in the 2012 X Factor final, scoring the show's fastest-selling winner's single ever - and the biggest single of 2012 - with a cover of Shontelle's Impossible. Now this week sees the release of Arthur's self-titled debut album. So James, how does it feel to finally have your own album coming out? I'm excited because I'm proud of it. I don't feel as though it sounds contrived or compromised, or overly produced or poppy or anything like that. I feel like there's pop songs on there but they're really - I hate using the word credible now - but they're really authentic sounding. The words are coming from me. It includes songs like Smoke Clouds and Suicide - not your average X Factor subject matter. Do you think you might genuinely be allowed to be yourself? I didn't ever work against [the X Factor team] but I would challenge them and I don't think they were used to that. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, who I wanted to be, which market I want to appeal to. They realised that if they didn't give me the licence I required then they won't get the best out of me. Emeli Sande co-wrote and sings on your track Roses, what was that like? It was absolutely incredible - for someone who was sat in his bedsit last year watching Emeli Sande on the TV. There is one artist in this country that is definitely for real, I feel like she just oozes artistry. They're the people I want to work with, people who understand that you have to be vulnerable when you're making music. You have to let your guard down and she does that so well. Who's next on the list then? I really want to work with Eminem. I know it will never happen, but I would love if he let me do a hook on one of his songs or he featured on one of my songs, it would be incredible. I've just always admired him since I was young. I admire the way he plays the media, the way he doesn't care what people think about him, yet he's so inspiring to so many people. And he's the best rapper on the earth. You mention the media. You've generated quite a few headlines yourself with things you've said recently - is that something you've done on purpose? A lot of the time it's just me being me, in the heat of the moment. I don't think about consequences too much. I want to be an example to people, so that in five year's time people say: "James always said what he thought, what he felt". I've done a few face palms after things I've said because it's stupid. But if I'm not like that I won't feel human anymore. I'll just feel like some robot saying what I'm supposed to say. I think that's when people lose it. Has anyone tried to media train you? I don't do media training. I don't do that. But has anyone suggested that you do it? Yeah. But what's the point in me getting up in the morning and coming in and speaking to 20 journalists and having a script in my mind? It's soul destroying. I'd rather just have a chat. The media like to twist things, that's the way it is. The things I've spoken out on [X Factor hopefuls Kingsland Road, One Direction] are not important things. It's just popular culture. But you have spoken about your own experiences - having panic attacks, contemplating suicide. They're big issues aren't they? You know when you read those things it looks like I've sat here and gone: "I've had such a bad year, I've contemplated suicide". But it's usually in passing: "Yeah couple of meltdowns I had last year". I did feel like I could have fell on my face and never woke up again, but then it gets made to look like I've sat here crying to the journalist and it's not the case. I'm just saying it's been hard, and it's the same with any profession. When you're under pressure you wish that you could just remove yourself completely from it. It is a massive change in lifestyle though, you walking in here with a couple of stylists and all the rest of it... Yeah, if I'd have sat there and said it's all been a walk in the park, nobody would believe you. It's hard, it's really weird. You can't have a night out any more because you see people getting more and more drunk and plucking up the courage to come and talk to you, and it kind of freaks you out. Even the people that you've grown up with. It's like, "Really? I'm the same dude who puked all over the front room one night". I've heard how so many people come from shows like X Factor and never recover. I want to have forgotten about it in 10 years time and had another life. Some people are very critical of the X Factor format and cynical about people that come through it, do you feel you have to fight back against that in a way? Yeah, I think it's amusing that. It's like, "why don't you just enjoy it?" It's entertainment, no one's trying to hurt anybody. I'm a big fan of the show. I don't want to be seen to be going, "I'm too credible, the X Factor's not how I want to be associated", because I think people have made that error in the past and it just makes you look like a pretentious idiot. I'm really proud to have come from it. It can be the only way to launch people now. On your UK tour next year you have an extra date in Middlesbrough, why was that important to you? It's going to be special because it's going to be the whole home town thing. They haven't had a show off me yet. I've only been there like twice [since winning X Factor]. I love where I come from. It's really important to give back to those people because they were probably the majority of people that voted for me, you know. James Arthur is out now. </body>

      <description>Fact mirrors fiction as spy chiefs face the cameras</description>

      <body>When Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) quizzes the three heads of the UK intelligence agencies later it will be the first such meeting in public. Fact often mirrors fiction in the world of spies. Before Thursday, if you had wanted to see British spy chiefs appear before parliamentarians and the cameras, your only opportunity would have been in the last James Bond film, Skyfall. Dame Judi Dench, playing M, had just lectured the assembled audience about why spies were still needed in the modern world when the villain of the tale burst into the room with guns blazing. Security is going to be tight in Parliament but no-one is quite expecting such a dramatic afternoon. The real-life hearing may be missing Dame Judi but it still will, in part, be about theatre and performance. Despite the presence of so many people who know so much, no-one should expect any secrets to be spilled. That is not the intention of the hearing - it is, rather, part of a wider effort both by spies and by those who scrutinise them to provide greater transparency about their work. And if any secrets do somehow slip out then the two-minute time delay on the TV feed means the outside world may well be prevented from hearing them. The hearing is only an hour and a half long; so the level of detail will be limited. Each head will want to discuss how they see the threats and explain what their organisation is doing to counter them. The three spy chiefs are all different characters. The chief of MI6, Sir John Sawers - often known as "C" rather than M - spent most of his career in the Foreign Office; so he is not a stranger to the TV cameras. Andrew Parker, from MI5, is new in the role but has been in the upper echelons of MI5 for many years. Sir Iain Lobban, of GCHQ, faces the hardest task. He has been running his agency for longer than either of the others but historically it has been the most secret and the least outward-facing. Or at least it was until the past few months, when former US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden began spilling its secrets, drawing its work into the spotlight as never before. The spies have already been giving evidence to the committee in private for many years and that is where the real detail will be discussed. But the decision was taken recently that this was no longer sufficient. Thirty years ago, the intelligence agencies existed almost entirely in the dark. There was no legal footing for them and no form of accountability - other than ministerial sign-off - until 1994. The names of the heads of the organisations would not even have been widely known. The spies began to speak in public in the 1990s in carefully controlled settings but this hearing marks a significant milestone. Modern concerns such as terrorism and cyber-security are inherently more public-facing than the kind of monitoring of the Soviet Union that occupied so much time in the Cold War. Public notions of transparency also mean the days of staying out of the limelight have gone. American spy chiefs do appear before Congress publicly but the hearings can be pretty anodyne. When the British committee watched some recordings of their US counterparts some of them had second thoughts about going public - they feared the snooze factor might be too much. So a key question will be how far the members of the ISC want to go in challenging the spy chiefs and giving them a hard time. That is important because it is not just the spy chiefs who people will be watching closely. The committee itself is also under scrutiny and this performance will be crucial in defining whether it really is capable of holding the intelligence agencies to account. Its performance in the decade after 9/11 has been criticised. A number of key controversies have swept through Britain's intelligence community - Iraq's absent weapons of mass destruction, whether the 7 July 2005 London bombings could have been prevented, and the UK's involvement in the rendition and transfer of detainees, to take the three most high-profile. But in each of these areas, the ISC has underperformed. The details about Iraq came out thanks to the Butler Inquiry and now the Chilcot Inquiry - not the ISC's own report. On 7/7, the committee had to go back and re-report after gaps in its initial findings. And, on rendition, the record is also decidedly patchy. The ISC's initial conclusions were challenged by evidence about British resident Binyam Mohamed who spent four years at Guantanamo Bay. Its findings was also called into question more recently over MI6's involvement with the transfer of two men to Libya - evidence which emerged thanks to the collapse of the Gaddafi regime rather than the oversight of the committee. The Snowden affair has raised new questions - including about whether the committee was too quick to defend spies rather than oversee them. The past problems were acknowledged by the committee's chairman, Sir Malcolm Rifkind, when he took over in 2010 and a number of reforms were introduced under the Justice and Security Act. The ISC can now demand information rather than request it and its remit has been extended formally to cover operations rather than just the management of the agencies. The committee's investigators can go into the agencies and look for material rather than take what they are given - something they have already done. Parliament - rather than No 10 - is also being given more power over the composition of the committee itself. Finally, we have the public hearing itself - the most visible sign that, in the spy world, times have changed. </body>

      <title>Why Hitler put 'degenerate' art on show</title>
      <description>Why the Nazis put on a show of 'degenerate' art</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24819441</url>

      <body>This week it was revealed that a huge stash of modern art had been found in a flat in Munich. Many of the paintings were considered "degenerate" by the Nazis, who staged an exhibition especially to ridicule them. Why did Hitler hate abstract art so much? In July 1937, four years after it came to power, the Nazi party put on two art exhibitions in Munich. The Great German Art Exhibition was designed to show works that Hitler approved of - depicting statuesque blonde nudes along with idealised soldiers and landscapes. The second exhibition, just down the road, showed the other side of German art - modern, abstract, non-representational - or as the Nazis saw it, "degenerate". The Degenerate Art Exhibition included works by some of the great international names - Paul Klee, Oskar Kokoschka and Wassily Kandinsky - along with famous German artists of the time such Max Beckmann, Emil Nolde and Georg Grosz. The exhibition handbook explained that the aim of the show was to "reveal the philosophical, political, racial and moral goals and intentions behind this movement, and the driving forces of corruption which follow them". Works were included "if they were abstract or expressionistic, but also in certain cases if the work was by a Jewish artist," says Jonathan Petropoulos, professor of European History at Claremont McKenna College and author of several books on art and politics in the Third Reich. He says the exhibition was laid out with the deliberate intention of encouraging a negative reaction. "The pictures were hung askew, there was graffiti on the walls, which insulted the art and the artists, and made claims that made this art seem outlandish, ridiculous." British artist Robert Medley went to see the show. "It was enormously crowded and all the pictures hung like some kind of provincial auction room where the things had been simply slapped up on the wall regardless to create the effect that this was worthless stuff," he says. Hitler had been an artist before he was a politician - but the realistic paintings of buildings and landscapes that he preferred had been dismissed by the art establishment in favour of abstract and modern styles. So the Degenerate Art Exhibition was his moment to get his revenge. He had made a speech about it that summer, saying "works of art which cannot be understood in themselves but need some pretentious instruction book to justify their existence will never again find their way to the German people". The Nazis claimed that degenerate art was the product of Jews and Bolsheviks, although only six of the 112 artists featured in the exhibition were actually Jewish. The art was divided into different rooms by category - art that was blasphemous, art by Jewish or communist artists, art that criticised German soldiers, art that offended the honour of German women. One room featured entirely abstract paintings, and was labelled "the insanity room". "In the paintings and drawings of this chamber of horrors there is no telling what was in the sick brains of those who wielded the brush or the pencil," reads the entry in the exhibition handbook. The idea of the exhibition was not just to mock modern art, but to encourage the viewers to see it as a symptom of an evil plot against the German people. The curators went to some lengths to get the message across, hiring actors to mingle with the crowds and criticise the exhibits. The Degenerate Art Exhibition in Munich attracted more than a million visitors - three times more than the officially sanctioned Great German Art Exhibition. Some realised it could be their last chance to see this kind of art in Germany, while others endorsed Hitler's views. Many people also came because of the air of scandal around the show - and it wasn't just Nazi sympathisers who found the art off-putting. Fritz Lustig was a young Jewish apprentice who went along to see the works of art. He says "they didn't seem to mean very much - if they were portraits they seemed to distort the faces... if they were things, they seemed to be quite different from what the things really looked like - I mean the word degenerate seemed to me to apply". The exhibition went on tour all over Germany, where it was seen by a million more people. Some of the art was later burned by the Nazis, and for many of the artists this was only the beginning of very hard times ahead. But Petropoulos says that for some, being banned by the Nazis turned out to have a positive side. "This artwork became more attractive abroad, or certainly in anti-Nazi circles it gained values because the Nazis opposed it, and I think that over the longer run it was good for modern art to be viewed as something that the Nazis detested and hated." Some of the artists featured in the exhibition are now considered among the greats of modern art. Lustig, who later fled the Nazis to settle in England, now enjoys the art that he once thought was degenerate. "Well, I have grown up since that - I was pretty young and I hadn't seen all that much art - I've changed my mind since then," he says. "I can appreciate modern art much better now than I did then. It's not meant to be beautiful is it?" Lucy Burns was reporting for Witness - which airs weekdays on BBC World Service radio. You can hear her report on degenerate art here.

      <title>John Waters: 'I wanted to be the filthiest person alive'</title>
      <description>Cult director John Waters says Hollywood comedies are 'gross'</description>

      <body>When John Waters was a little boy in Baltimore growing up amidst the strict moral values of 1950s America, he fantasised about growing up to run a porn film theatre: "I knew what I wanted to be - the filthiest person alive." But the cult director and writer, who set out to shock with subversive, darkly comic films such as Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Pecker, says he is now struck by the scale of "obscene" content on screen - particularly the treatment of women in films and porn. He noted with interest a recent interview with Tom Hanks, who said he was "amazed" by how "filthy" mainstream comedy had become. The Guardian asked Hanks whether it would be impossible to remake his 1988 film Big - about a 12-year-old boy who wishes himself into an adult body - because the protagonist has sex with an older woman. Actually, the star said, an update would be far "raunchier". Waters sympathises: "Hollywood now does do bad taste," he tells BBC Radio 3 ahead of his appearance at Liverpool's Homotopia festival, "and mostly they do it badly". "I liked The Hangover. I liked Bridesmaids. It's something they do great. But what do you think of as American humour now? Mostly you think of a big, Hollywood gross-out movie. And they aren't funny, they're just gross. "It's easy to do that. It's simple to do that. But to have wit and to have you [the viewer] change how you think about something - which I always try to do... I'm not saying I was successful but Pink Flamingos, it still plays. It's still successful. It didn't get politically correct." The low-budget director - whose soubriquets include 'pope of trash" and "prince of puke" - also finds modern internet porn depressing and unsettling. That may come as a surprise. After all, Waters chose a gay "outsider" pornographer as one of the Role Models in his 2010 book of the same name. But he acknowledges there is a huge gulf between the innocent 10-year-old boy who knew the titles of dirty books and sneaked them from under the counter at the library, and the unfiltered internet porn that children can stumble across today. "I agree that some porn is obscene today," he says. "Someone said 'it's not making love, it's making hate'. Especially heterosexual porn. "I think in the gay porn you can tell they're both in on it. In some of the hetero porn [with] the [treatment of] women you cannot tell. But that is the limits of free speech we have to put up with." 'Stupid people' In most of Waters' films, there's as much male as female nudity and the unrealistic sex is played for laughs. Even though the likes of Pink Flamingos, Female Trouble and Desperate Living (his rather charming attempt at a lesbian Disney fairytale) feature cannibalism, rape, child abuse and castration, good always triumphs and a wild revenge is wreaked with the chopping off of homemade rubber body parts amidst huge splatters of fake blood. "In Female Trouble there's a scene where Divine has sex with himself. But you know Divine's playing both roles… it's always so ludicrous. Sexual abuse is always punished." There is a striking contrast, he says, between Pink Flamingos' good natured attempt to shock, and the forensically detailed, realistic violence of so-called 'torture porn' films like Saw and equally mainstream fare as The Killer Inside Me (2010) - a film rated R despite its depiction of what the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America) called "disturbing brutal violence, aberrant sexual content and some graphic nudity". If anything makes Waters angry it's "stupid people" and that includes some of the film censors he's had to deal with: "In the early days censors made my career. I made my career on negative reviews. Though the scariest was the censor board here in the UK. They said [of Pink Flamingos] 'We don't know how to deal with intentional bad taste.'" But for Cry Baby (1990) - his big Hollywood commission after the success of Hairspray! - Waters was obligated to bring it in with a PG 13 rating to ensure Johnny Depp's young fans could see it. That meant lots of cuts. After the success of R-rated Serial Mom (1994) - "a satirical presentation of strong violence, vulgar language, and sexual episodes" - and 1998's Pecker - "sexuality, graphic nudity, language and brief drug use" - Waters put up a fight over the rating given to A Dirty Shame (2003) starring Johnny Knoxville and Tracy Ullman. The comedy about sex addicts which contained no actual sex and no violence was not well received critically, but most importantly it was rated NC-17 - an adult certificate that is commercial death in the US. "Your film is really ruined by that because there are theatres that won't play it." He thinks the film's reception was affected by the concurrent outrage over the Abu Ghraib prison abuse photos. "I think Iraq had something to do with it. People really didn't think that weird sex stuff was funny then in America. "I appealed [the rating] and I lost the case. "I'm not saying it would have been a success with an R rating, but it did hurt it. And it's amazing to me how in America it's still very uptight about sex and pro-violence and in Europe it's usually the other way round." Waters has just finished a book about hitchhiking across America on his own (due out next June) which he said proved a heartwarming experience, apart from the occasional 10-hour waits. Most of his lifts came he said from "straight men who'd been through something bad in their lives like drugs but come through it and now loved their wives." What did he learn? "The basic goodness of people which I've always believe in. I'm an optimist. Yes, terrible things can happen. It didn't happen to me." Waters has been fascinated by high profile criminal cases since the Manson Family murders. He says he and his mother are following the hacking trial involving former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks with great interest. And he now regards himself as a "filth elder" - and spends much of his year touring universities giving talks about his career to students. So what does he make of Miley Cyrus - surely a girl just trying to shock and get away from her 'clean teen' past, like many of the heroines in his films? It's a rare moment when Waters looks unimpressed. "I'm not interested in her. I don't dislike her. I don't care about her. She's certainly not scandalising me. "I still think you can be a rock star and act bad, but it has to be in a new way." John Waters is still fighting the war on taste. But he has standards, you know. BBC Radio 3 will broadcast a full interview with John Waters at 22:00 GMT on Wednesday, 6 November as part of the Free Thinking season. </body>
