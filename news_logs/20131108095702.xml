      <body>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn has told the BBC. He was speaking in Sunderland, where Nissan employs 6,500 workers. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election in 2015. But Mr Ghosn also added that he considered the exit scenario to be unlikely. When asked how Nissan would react if the UK were to leave the EU, Mr Ghosn said: "If anything has to change, we [would] need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future." Mr Ghosn was visiting Sunderland for the launch of the company's new Qashqai model, which will be built there. Praising the Sunderland plant, Mr Ghosn said it was one of the most productive in Europe and said Nissan was "blessed" to own it. With sales of more than 240,000 last year, the Qashqai is Nissan's best-selling car in Europe. The car accounts for more than half the output of the Sunderland plant and Mr Ghosn says the new model "ensures" a lot of jobs in the city. Mr Ghosn, who is also chief executive of Nissan's sister company Renault, says that after five years of decline the European car market is arriving at "the end of the tunnel". He says that next year the European market should be stable with possibly a little growth. Action by the European Central Bank, including Thursday's cut in interest rates, could help that recovery according to Mr Ghosn. </body>

      <title>S&amp;P cuts France credit rating to AA</title>
      <description>Standard and Poor's cuts France's credit rating again to AA, almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status.</description>

      <body>Standard and Poor's (SandP) has cut France's credit rating to AA from AA+. The moves comes almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status. SandP said it downgraded France because high unemployment in the country was making it hard for the government to make important reforms which would boost growth, The French government responded by saying that its debt rating was one of the safest in the eurozone. SandP said it expected government debt to hit 86% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 and unemployment to remain above 10% until 2016. The country's Finance Minister, Pierre Moscovici, said SandP had made "critical and inexact judgements". He said in a statement: "During the last 18 months the government has implemented major reforms aimed at improving the French economic situation, restoring its public finances, and its competitiveness." In theory, a lower credit rating makes borrowing more expensive. The return for investors buying French debt indeed did rise after the announcement. The yield on French government 10-year bonds rose more than 20 basis points to 2.389% from 2.158%. SandP said in its statement: "We believe the French government's reforms to taxation, as well as to product, services and labour markets, will not substantially raise France's medium-term growth prospects and that ongoing high unemployment is weakening support for further significant fiscal and structural policy measures." Our business editor, Robert Peston, said SandP was "very publicly criticising France for not doing more to lift its economy out of the economic doldrums and cut persistently high unemployment". He said that, coming on the back of yesterday's decision by the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to almost zero, to ward off the threat of deflation and a return to recession, it was more evidence that the eurozone's structural weaknesses are far from being fixed. The French Prime Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said France's ratings remained among the best in the world and that the agency did not take into account all the reforms made by the government. However, the downgrade could be the last for some time. SandP attached a "stable outlook" to France, which implies a less than one-in-three chance that it would change France's rating over the next two years. </body>

      <body>International Airways Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways, has posted a rise in pre-tax profit to 609m euros (£507m) for the three months from July to September. The results are up from 237m euros for the same period in 2012. The company reported a pre-tax profit of 103m euros for the first nine months of 2013. This marks a turnaround from last year, when IAG saw a 121m-euro loss in pre-tax profits for the first nine months. Its Spanish airline, Iberia, struggled amid the economic crisis. Willie Walsh, chief executive at IAG, said a strong London and transatlantic market, the 2012 Olympic games and prioritising cost control had helped British Airways. He said Iberia's performance had improved. Mr Walsh added: "However, the airline must continue to implement its restructuring plan and reach agreement on productivity changes to bring about long-term sustainable profits and growth." </body>

      <title>Regulator blocks water bill rise bid</title>
      <description>Ofwat, the water regulator, has confirmed that it has turned down Thames Water's request to increase customer bills by up to 8% next year.</description>

      <body>Ofwat, the water regulator, has confirmed that it has turned down Thames Water's request to increase customer bills by up to 8% next year. Thames had asked to add an extra £29, or 8%, to the annual average household bill for 2014-15. But the regulator has ruled that it must stick to a 1.4%-above-inflation maximum rise, set in the latest price review. The company said it was reviewing the decision carefully. It has the option to appeal against the decision to the Competition Commission. Thames said it had faced extra costs of £291m, because various items had cost more than the amount estimated when the price regime was set. These included bad debts, the transfer of private sewers, land purchases and higher Environment Agency charges that could not be fully estimated at the time. Ofwat and Thames disagree about how much these items will cost the company. The regulator said in October that it was minded to turned down the requested extra price rise. It has now confirmed that decision. "We said we would challenge Thames' application, in the interests of customers. We did just that and on the evidence provided, we are not convinced that an extra bill increase is justified," said Ofwat's chief regulation officer, Sonia Brown. The current annual average household bill from Thames Water is £354. Responding to Ofwat's decision, the company said: "We will review the decision carefully before deciding on our next steps." A week ago, Ofwat's chairman, Jonson Cox, wrote to the water companies asking them whether they needed to increase their bills for the full agreed amount next year, given the squeeze on household finances. In December, all water companies will submit their plans for the next price review, which will eventually determine how much they can charge from 2015 to 2020. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson has written to companies calling on them to recognise people's financial strain and "look closely" at whether price rises were justified. Labour leader Ed Miliband has called for extra help for people struggling to pay their water bills. New social tariffs for the low-paid, which were introduced on a voluntary basis last year, should be made compulsory, he said. </body>

      <title>Npower boss rejects bonus 'gimmicks'</title>
      <description>Amid controversy over rising energy prices, Npower chief executive Paul Massara dismisses forfeiting his bonus as a "gimmick".</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24861448</url>

      <body>The chief executive of Npower, Paul Massara, has dismissed giving up a bonus in response to anger over rising energy prices as a "gimmick". In an interview with the BBC's Hardtalk, Mr Massara also warned of future power cuts unless there is a "stable environment" for investment. He said he earned around £600,000 a year, which includes a £150,000 bonus. On Monday Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw pledged to decline a bonus this year to help restore trust in energy companies. When asked whether he would match Mr Laidlaw's pledge, Mr Massara said: "I think the issue is, are we doing absolutely everything we can to keep costs down and to make sure it's affordable? "Gimmicks of saying 'I'm going to reduce my bonus' - If Sam was earning five million a year and he's willing to give a million, good for him. "My bonus is linked to my performance, is linked to getting it right for customers, is linked to employee satisfaction. All of my team are linked to that. If we don't deliver on that, we don't get a bonus." He said he thought the lights would stay on this year, but warned: "The amount of spare capacity to meet the peak requirement... has dropped from somewhere around 15% to five. "That is extremely low by historical levels... and unless the UK can create a politically stable environment to attract new capital, that new capital will not come in." On Monday Mr Laidlaw said the energy sector needed to urgently rebuild consumers' trust and to help do that he would not take a bonus this year. "Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it," he said. Recent increases of around 9% have caused anger and last month the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee summoned energy bosses to explain the steep rise in prices. In September Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to to freeze energy bills for 20 months if he is successful in the 2015 election. Energy companies complain that government policy is to blame for higher energy prices in particular "green" fees which are added to bills. Currently 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. Mr Massara told Hardtalk: "The more the government creates uncertainty with things like price freezes or other changes, it means there's less certainty and less likely for capital investment." </body>

      <body>Barclays is to close four branches and move staff and banking services to nearby Asda stores. It said it then wanted to open another four branches in Asda supermarkets by early next year in an attempt to make banking more convenient. The initial four branches will swap locations to make parking easier, and sees branches with relatively low footfall being moved to the stores. Asda said that access to banking services was vital for communities. Bank staff will work at the new supermarket-based branches during normal bank opening hours, with cash and cheque machines accessible during the supermarkets' opening hours. The first branch will be opened in an Asda store at Birchwood in Cheshire in February. Three more will later be opened at Asda stores in Pudsey in West Yorkshire, North Watford in Hertfordshire and Broadstairs in East Kent. The additional four stores for new branches will be chosen later. </body>

      <title>Disney fixes Star Wars release date</title>
      <description>The Walt Disney Company announces it will release the next Star Wars film on 18 December 2015 as it reports better-than-expected earnings.</description>

      <body>The Walt Disney Company has announced it will release the next Star Wars film on 18 December 2015. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, from creator George Lucas last year for $4bn (£2.6bn). It has committed to making at least three new films in the series, one of the most successful franchises ever. Disney announced the release date as it reported a better-than-expected 12% jump in net profit for the three months to 28 September. It made a net profit of $1.39bn during the quarter, up from $1.24bn during the same period last year. The company also reported that its net income for the financial year to 28 September jumped 8% from a year ago to $6.1bn. "We're extremely pleased with our results for Fiscal 2013, delivering record revenue, net income and earnings per share for the third year in a row," Robert Iger, chief executive of the firm, said in a statement. Disney's movie studio business saw a 7% jump in revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenues rose to $1.5bn during the period, helped mainly by the strong performance of Monsters University, which Disney said "partially offset" the weak showing of The Lone Ranger. However, operating income at Disney's cable network unit, which includes the ESPN sports channel, fell by 7% to $1.3bn in the last quarter, which the firm said was due to the timing of some ESPN affiliate fee revenues. </body>

      <title>China data adds to recovery hopes</title>
      <description>China's exports and imports rise in October, the latest in a series of figures indicating a recovery in its economy.</description>

      <body>China's exports and imports rose in October, the latest in a series of figures indicating a recovery. Exports, a key driver of its growth, rose 5.6% from a year earlier, while imports jumped 7.6%. This follows data released earlier this month which showed that manufacturing activity in China grew at its fastest pace in 18 months in October. The numbers come ahead of key meetings of China's Communist Party, with economic reforms set to be discussed. Known as the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the meeting will run from 9 to 12 November, and top leaders are expected to discuses reforming key areas such as the financial sector and state-owned enterprises. China's economy, the world's second-biggest, has shown signs of a pick up after seeing its growth rate slow in first half of the year. Its economy grew 7.8% in the July-to-September quarter from a year earlier, up from the 7.5% expansion recorded in the previous three months. Some analysts said the pick up had been helped by a recovery in demand from key export markets such as the US. "Combined with the better export data in Korea and Taiwan, China's export numbers suggests some - although not yet decisive - improvement in global demand momentum," said Louis Kuijs, an economist with Royal Bank of Scotland. Over the past few months Beijing has also announced stimulus measures aimed at helping exporters and boosting domestic demand. These include tax breaks for small businesses, reduced fees for exporters and the opening up of railway construction. Analysts said that domestic consumption in China was likely to pick up in coming months and help boost its overall growth. "Domestic demand is still holding up, which can be seen from the import growth, and the recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figure also indicated that the domestic demand will continue to gain more steam in the coming quarters," said Sun Junwei, an economist with HSBC Global Research in Shanghai. Earlier this month, China also reported that its services sector, which accounts for almost 43% of its overall economy, grew at its fastest pace in a year in October, The positive data follows a rise in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment in September. </body>

      <title>Twitter shares jump on market debut</title>
      <description>Shares in the micro-blogging site Twitter close at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26, after the firm's first day as public company.</description>

      <body>Shares in the micro-blogging site Twitter closed at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26 each. That means after its first day as a public company, Twitter is now valued at a little over $31bn (£19bn). More than 13 million shares were traded once they became available an hour after the New York Stock Exchange opened. It is the biggest technology listing since Facebook in 2012. Twitter floated on the NYSE and not, as some initially expected, the technology-rich Nasdaq exchange, where the likes of Facebook are listed. It was a big win for the NYSE, which decorated its exterior with banners promoting the offering on Thursday. Twitter has more than 230 million users, but is yet to make a profit. Shares in newly-listed companies are often volatile on their first day of trading. Within minutes, Twitter's stock price soared more than 80% before closing just below its initial opening price of $45.10 per share. When Facebook launched on Nasdaq, its shares were priced initially at $38 each. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45. But its price later slumped. It only recovered those losses by 11 September 2013, when shares again touched $45. Its initial public offering (IPO) was also marred by technological glitches and delays. To prevent Twitter's stock sale from having a similar fate, the NYSE ran tests on 26 October using larger-than-normal share volumes. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise more than $1.82bn. The company, which invites users to send tweets in 140 characters or less, has 232 million active users. According to its IPO documents, these users send 500 million tweets a day. Twitter's financials have been under greater scrutiny since it announced its plan to float, especially given that the company is still loss-making. It lost $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. About 85% of revenues come from advertising on its site, and more than 75% of Twitter users access the site from their mobile phone. Mary Jo White, head of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently warned investors to be cautious of the metrics used by technology companies like Twitter, noting that investors have become overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of data. "In the absence of a clear description, it can be hard not to think that these big numbers will inevitably translate into big profits for the company," she said in a speech. "But the connection may not necessarily be there." Twitter's founders saw their paper wealth soar to $4bn in the wake of the stock surge early this morning, although boss Dick Costolo said that none of the founders would immediately be selling their shares. The company's co-founder Evan Williams has a 10% stake in Twitter, making him its biggest shareholder. That stake is now worth a little over $2bn. Jack Dorsey, another co-founder, also stands to make a fortune from the IPO. His 4% stake is worth more than a billion dollars. Another co-founder, Biz Stone, is thought to have made millions of dollars by selling share stakes over the last few years. Big fortunes aside, after the hooplah of the morning, it was very quickly was back to work: Twitter employee Melissa Daimler posted a photo of employees at their desk just hours after the NYSE bell was rung. </body>

      <body>Electric car maker Tesla's Model S has suffered its third fire in five weeks. In the latest incident, which took place on Wednesday in Tennessee in the US, a fire broke out in a car after it hit debris on the road. Tesla said the fire did not start spontaneously but was the result of the accident. The previous two fires have also been related to accidents. The firm's shares fell more than 7% on Thursday, following a 14% fall on Wednesday triggered by weak earnings. The company reported that it made a net loss of $38m in the July-to-September period. Analysts said that while the incidents had been sparked by accidents, investors had been worried over any potential impact on the firm. "For a company with a stock price based as much or more on image than financials, those recurring headlines are highly damaging," said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, added that the risk of a formal investigation by US safety regulators "could raise near-term concerns to a higher level in terms of cost, image and production disruption". Tesla's shares fell 7.5% to close at $139.7 on Thursday. In October, a Model S caught fire after the driver ran over what Tesla said was "an extremely large object". After the fire, officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had said they found no evidence to indicate that it resulted from defects or violations of US safety standards The second incident took place in Mexico later in the month. According to reports a car caught fire after it drove through a roundabout, crashed through a concrete wall and hit a tree. Tesla said it is investigating the latest incident in Tennessee to find out what had sparked the fire. "Our team is on its way to Tennessee to learn more about what happened in the accident," Tesla spokeswoman Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean said in a statement. "We will provide more information when we're able to do so." The firm's chief executive, Elon Musk, has previously said that electric cars are safer compared to conventional cars. </body>

      <body>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25%, down from 0.5%. The move came as a surprise to many analysts. ECB president Mario Draghi said the decision to cut rates reflected an outlook of low inflation and economic weakness in the eurozone. Inflation in the eurozone fell to 0.7% in October - its lowest level since January 2010, stoking concerns of deflation in some countries. Prices in Greece - one of the eurozone members worst hit by the economic crisis - have not risen since July. Some economists are also worried about deflation in Spain. The ECB's target is to keep inflation just below 2% - seen as a healthy level for economic growth. Speaking at a press conference after the announcement of the rate cut, Mr Draghi said the bank expected to see "a prolonged period of low inflation followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates of below but close to 2%", and said the eurozone was seeing "weaker than expected economic activity". "Accordingly, our stance will remain accommodative as long as necessary," he said. He reiterated a pledge to keep rates low for the foreseeable future as part of the bank's new policy of offering forward guidance alongside its decisions. "Deflationary risks and the stronger euro seem to have motivated the ECB's move," said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING. "It is obvious that the ECB under president Draghi has become much more pro-active than under any of his predecessors." Rates had been held at 0.5% since May, and before that were cut to 0.75% in July 2012. The cut in the benchmark rate is designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that this will be passed on to businesses taking out loans, boosting the economy. The 17-member eurozone returned to growth in the second quarter of the year, recording a 0.3% increase GDP. But unemployment remains high and austerity measures in a number of countries continue to hold back growth. The euro fell sharply against the dollar in response to the decision, dropping more than 1%. A weaker euro may be a help to the eurozone economy by making European goods cheaper abroad, benefiting exporters. </body>

      <title>Plan to save salary-linked pensions</title>
      <description>Salary-linked workplace pensions will disappear unless action is taken to make the schemes cheaper for employers, a minister warns.</description>

      <body>Salary-linked workplace pensions will disappear unless action is taken to make the schemes cheaper for employers, a minister has warned. Pensions Minister Steve Webb has unveiled plans to remove legal obligations surrounding traditional final-salary schemes. He also wants employers to be able to improve lower grade pension arrangements, now used by most firms. Only 1.7 million private sector workers now contribute to final-salary schemes. In 1995, five million private sector employees were contributing to these schemes, which promise to pay a proportion of salary on retirement. Under the proposed new law, employers would no longer be required to give pensioners annual inflation increases. In addition, they would not be expected to provide pensions for spouses after the former staff member has died. Pension rights already earned would be secure, under the plans. The government hopes that by giving bosses the flexibility to cut back future benefits, some of the remaining salary-linked schemes will survive and remain open to new employees. The legislation could be in place before the next election in 2015, according to Mr Webb. The ideas have been welcomed by some providers. Otto Thoresen, director general of the Association of British Insurers (ABI), said: "The ABI welcomes this consultation which provides a clear basis on which to debate a range of alternative ways to improve certainty for pension savers." Millions of workers are being enrolled automatically in new workplace pension arrangements, but for the most part these are not linked to pay. In many cases the contribution levels are so low that the eventual pension income is likely to be relatively meagre. The forthcoming legislation will encourage companies to provide income guarantees in these schemes, in the hope that people will regard pensions as less of a gamble and contribute more. The government is also planning to change the law to allow "Dutch-style" pensions. Employers would be able to band together to offer large-scale schemes which target a particular level of pension income. Ministers have been persuaded that these "Collective Defined Contribution" schemes would be cheaper to run and could provide savers with more certainty about their retirement. The government refers to the proposals as a whole as Defined Ambition pensions. The proposed new types of pension are: Analysts have said the plans will not solve the pension difficulties faced by UK workers. "There is no private pension structure that will entirely meet the needs of everyone without some risks attached," said Danny Wilding, partner at consultants Barnett Waddingham. "However the options described in the consultation would help to alleviate some of the major issues that are present in the current pension landscape." </body>

      <title>Agency downgrades RBS credit ratings</title>
      <description>Royal Bank of Scotland expresses disappointment after its credit ratings are downgraded by ratings agency S&amp;P.</description>

      <body>RBS has expressed disappointment after its credit ratings were downgraded by Standard and Poor's (SandP). The ratings agency said it had removed a "positive transition notch" it had built into the bank's ratings in 2011 in recognition of progress the group had made in restructuring. SandP downgraded The Royal Bank of Scotland plc and its core operating subsidiaries to A-/A-2, from A/A-1. The agency also gave the bank a "negative outlook". It said the move reflected the "negative trend that we see for UK banking industry risk". The lowering of the long-term and short-term ratings came a week after RBS announced it would not split itself into separate so-called good and bad banks. In a statement, SandP said: "The lowering of the ratings reflects our view of the changes that RBS has announced to its restructuring plan, which include the creation of an internal 'bad bank' and the accelerated disposals of higher-risk assets. "In our view, these changes create additional near-term execution risks and further delay the group's return to sustainable organic capital build. "Although we recognise that the new plan has the potential to support RBS' creditworthiness over the longer term, we consider that the extended and expanded restructuring is not consistent with our previous expectations for the group's progress in its transition." SandP also said the revised restructuring plan, "with its associated large credit losses and execution risks", had come at a time of continued underperformance in the group's core businesses, including the investment banking and international banking divisions. It added that "considerable uncertainties" remained over the bank's exposure to future litigation and conduct risk. The subsidiaries affected by the ratings downgrade are The Royal Bank of Scotland plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland NV and National Westminster Bank plc. Responding to the downgrade, RBS said: "We are not expecting this downgrade to have a material adverse impact on the liquidity of the group. "Given the neutral stance of the other agencies, we are disappointed with SandP's decision to downgrade our ratings." In a separate development, RBS has been told to pay nearly £100m as a settlement for the misleading sale of complex financial instruments in the United States during 2007. A US subsidiary of RBS was found to have misled investors about the safety of home loans behind $2.2bn (£1.37bn) worth of financial instruments. The residential mortgage-backed securities were one of the main reasons banks made major losses in the financial crash. The $154m (£95.7m) settlement, which follows an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission, is being met from funds RBS has already set aside. The US financial regulator said it would use the money to compensate investors "for harm suffered as a result of RBS's conduct". </body>

      <title>Downton Abbey 'can help UK business'</title>
      <description>The popularity of the Royal Family and the TV drama Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers are told.</description>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <title>Tesco to use face-scan ad targeting</title>
      <description>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target adverts at different types of customers.</description>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all of its 450 forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, from Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <description>David Cameron backs Iain Duncan Smith's handling of universal credit - after claims the work secretary tried to "lean on" MPs investigating welfare changes.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has backed Iain Duncan Smith's handling of universal credit after a report by MPs claimed the welfare shake-up had gone badly wrong. The public accounts committee said much of the £425m spent so far may have to be written-off due to poor management. Mr Duncan Smith denies claims he tried to "lean on" members of the committee to place the blame on his top official. Downing Street said the work and pensions secretary was "doing exactly the right thing" with the new scheme. In a damning report, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said management supervision of universal credit had been "alarmingly weak". The committee said the project - to merge six separate means-tested working age benefits into a single payment - had been beset by a string of problems and still faced considerable challenges if it was to achieve its long-term objectives. initial estimates suggest at least £140m, spent on IT systems which cannot be used, will have to be written off but the full losses could be much higher, and may take up much of the £425m spent on the project to April 2013, the report says. Labour sources on the committee have told BBC News there was a "concerted" effort by Conservative members to shift the blame from Mr Duncan Smith on to his permanent secretary Robert Devereux. One source said there had been a number of extra meetings and discussions over amendments "pointing the finger" at Mr Devereux but the committee eventually rejected the criticisms of the official in the final text of the report. These claims were categorically denied by Mr Duncan Smith's spokeswoman, who said: "Iain has not asked for anyone to be named in the report. He has publicly supported the Department for Work and Pensions permanent secretary throughout this whole process." The committee's Labour chairman Margaret Hodge said she had not been approached by Mr Duncan Smith, but sidestepped questions about whether she was aware of pressure being put on Conservative colleagues. Conservative MP Steve Barclay, a member of the committee, said he could "absolutely rebuff" the suggestion that Mr Duncan Smith had tried to influence the committee, which is meant to be non-partisan and impartial. David Cameron's official spokesman was asked several times to confirm that the prime minister was "confident" that universal credit would be delivered on time and on budget, but did not do so. Instead, he told reporters: "The department is working to the 2017 timetable. That is the timetable that the department continues to work to. That is the target the department is shooting for and we are going to continue to work towards it in the way we are." The spokesman was asked whether it would be proper for a secretary of state to approach members of a select committee ahead of the publication of a report in the way alleged of Mr Duncan Smith. He replied: "There are procedures that are in place for the relationship between departments and select committees and that is something the Department for Work and Pensions have been very clear about." Asked if the prime minister was "completely happy" with Mr Duncan Smith's handling of the implementation of universal credit, Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "He thinks that the secretary of state and the department are doing exactly the right thing in rolling this out in a progressive way and in a way that allows us to learn lessons as we go. "That is what is being done and he very much supports that." Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who has oversight of Universal Credit as part of his civil service reform role, said it was a "very hard-hitting" and "useful" report which highlighted wider problems in Whitehall: "We are not that good at financial control... but also project management has been deficient for a long time." Labour's shadow leader of the Commons, Angela Eagle, demanded an urgent statement from Mr Duncan Smith on the allegations that he tried to "lean on" members of the committee. Ms Eagle described the PAC report as "devastating" and told the Commons: "It seems that the blame game for this costly fiasco has already started. "This morning we learn of a wholly improper attempt to lean on members of an independent select committee of this House by Mr Duncan Smith and his parliamentary team to try to put the blame on the permanent secretary." Commons Leader Andrew Lansley said he had spoken to Mr Duncan Smith and saw no need for him to come to the Commons to explain himself. In its report, the select committee said control over suppliers in the Universal Credit had largely been absent, with multi-million pound orders sometimes being signed off by secretarial staff. From the outset of the project in 2011, it said, senior civil servants had "failed to grasp the enormity" of the task they had been set by ministers, did not monitor progress adequately and had not intervened when issues arose. A lack of day-to-day control meant that top officials only became aware of difficulties through "ad hoc reviews" and as problems mounted, those in charge of the scheme had become "isolated and defensive". Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: "The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money. "Pressure to deliver a programme of this magnitude within such an ambitious timescale created a fortress culture where only good news was reported and problems were denied." Howard Shiplee, who took over the running of the project in May, has admitted mistakes were made but said real progress was now happening and much of the existing IT systems could be used. Responding to the committee's report, the Department for Work and Pensions said universal credit was a "vital" reform which would ultimately bring £38bn in benefits to society by helping people into work and reducing fraud. "This report doesn't take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery," it said. "We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls." It said it did not accept "the write-off figure quoted by the committee" and expected it to be substantially less. </body>

      <title>Mis-selling compensation 'too slow'</title>
      <description>The process of compensating small businesses that were mis-sold complicated insurance products has been "slower than expected", the regulator says.</description>

      <body>The process of compensating businesses that were mis-sold complicated insurance products has been "slower than expected", the regulator has said. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the current pace of redress meant a target of completing compensation within a year was likely to be missed. Up to 25,000 businesses could be in line for compensation after being mis-sold the interest rate swaps. The FCA has written to banks to agree ways to speed up the process. Many thousands of small businesses were sold the products in the years between 2001 and 2008. Those affected include vets, care home operators, hauliers and pub owners. Many who had taken out a loan with their bank were advised to "hedge" against the possibility of interest rates going up. In return for higher fees, they were told they would not have to pay extra if the Bank of England raised base rates. In fact, the Bank reduced rates, from 2008 onwards. As a result, many small firms were faced with paying much more for their loans, or having to find tens of thousands of pounds in exit fees. The four banks concerned, HSBC, Lloyds, Barclays and Royal Bank of Scotland, made large profits from the products, known as interest rate hedging products (IRHPs). They have agreed to pay 8% interest on top of basic compensation, to cover the businesses' cost of being deprived of the money. The compensation process started in May, but the FCA has now said that "progress to this point has been slower than expected". Progress has improved in recent weeks, the FCA said. However, the most recent figures from October still show that the banks were missing their targets. They expected to resolve 1,000 cases during the month, but only completed 800 - partly owing to operational problems, but also partly owing to delays following independent reviews of the system. This has caused some "customer frustration", the FCA said. It has told the banks to speed up the process, and has also agreed to change the system to help them do that. This meant that the FCA has agreed with HSBC, RBS and Lloyds Banking Group to split compensation payments. Initial compensation for the swap mis-selling will be paid first, with redress for more complicated consequential losses paid later. </body>

      <body>The Bank of England has left interest rates unchanged at 0.5% and made no change to its programme of quantitative easing, as had been widely expected. The decision came as no surprise as the Bank has said it will not consider a rate rise until the unemployment rate falls below 7%. The focus will now switch to the Bank's latest inflation report, due next week. Analysts will examine the report for indications on how strongly the Bank thinks the UK economy is recovering. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has kept interest rates on hold at 0.5% since March 2009. Under the Bank's policy of forward guidance, brought in under new governor Mark Carney, it has said it will not increase interest rates until the rate of unemployment has dropped below 7%. When the Bank first announced this, in August this year, it said it did not expect this to happen until 2016. However, many analysts believe that the Bank will have to act sooner than that - possibly in 2015 - given the increasing strength of the UK's economy. The last set of unemployment figures showed the jobless rate had dropped to 7.7% in the June-to-August period. The economy grew by 0.8% in the third quarter of the year, and recent economic surveys have indicated that growth remained strong in October. "The decision to hold interest rates and QE was expected and correct," said David Kern, chief economist at the British Chambers of Commerce. "However, as the pace of economic growth strengthens, it is becoming clear that the first rise in official interest rates is likely to occur well before the Committee's 2016 prediction, due to the earlier than anticipated fall in unemployment. "The MPC must use next week's Inflation Report to move towards a more realistic timetable for its forward guidance, to maintain business confidence and keep its credibility." </body>

      <body>The US economy grew at an annual pace of 2.8% in the third quarter of the year, latest figures have shown. The growth rate was faster than expected, and was an improvement on the 2.5% pace seen in the previous quarter. Growth was lifted by rising exports, businesses restocking shelves and a pick-up in home construction. However, the pace of growth in consumer spending - which accounts for about two-thirds of US economic activity - slowed from the previous quarter. Consumer spending grew at annual pace of 1.5%, down from 1.7% in the April-to-June period and the slowest rate since 2011. The release of the third-quarter GDP figures was delayed by a week because of the partial shutdown of the US government last month. Chris Thornberg, partner at Beacon Economics, said he thought 2.8% was a "good number". "You have got to remember at the start of the year there was a $2.8bn tax increase after the fiscal cliff," he said. That, he said, had taken a 1.8% "bite out of consumer income". Mr Thornberg added: "The only thing that worries me is that some of the growth is coming from inventory build-up, about 0.8%." The inventory build-up refers to products that have been produced but yet sold, such as cars, he said. </body>

      <title>Strike brings Greece to a halt</title>
      <description>Workers in Greece are holding a 24-hour general strike over continuing cuts as international lenders decide whether to unlock further bailout money.</description>

      <body>Workers in Greece are holding a 24-hour general strike over continuing cuts as international lenders decide whether to unlock further bailout money. Flights and other transport are being disrupted by action in both the public and private sectors, and schools and hospitals are also affected. But torrential rain in Athens has limited public protests, with both main unions cancelling their rallies. Greece has held more than 30 general strikes since early 2010. Unemployment stands at nearly 28% after massive public sector cuts and tax rises to reduce its fiscal deficit. Greece has been granted two bailouts totalling about 240bn euros (£202bn; $323bn) to help cover holes in its financing, and there is speculation it will need a third package of at least 11bn euros next year. At issue just now is the latest instalment from the second bailout, worth 1bn euros. The payment must be approved by the troika of lenders: the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The troika says there is a budget gap of 2.5bn euros for next year that may require more austerity but the government argues the country cannot take any more. Greece has predicted that it will emerge from its six-year long recession next year, in a sign it may be finally recovering from its debt crisis. However, recovery for Europe's sick man remains a slow and painful process that could yet take years to achieve, the BBC's Mark Lowen reports from Athens. Two separate protest marches to parliament in Athens were called off due to bad weather. But smaller groups of mainly Communist Party supporters still braved the driving rain, according to reports. Meanwhile thousands of people marched in Greece's second city Thessaloniki. Ferry, rail and some air services are still being disrupted by Wednesday's action. Air traffic controllers have stopped work for several hours. "Workers, pensioners and the unemployed are going through an endless nightmare," port workers said in a statement. "The government and the troika are destroying this country." The public sector union Adedy said in a statement: "United we can stop them, we can topple them." When troika auditors arrived at the finance ministry in Athens on Tuesday, a protester flung coins at its leader, Poul Thomsen. The attacker was arrested but reportedly later released. </body>

      <title>Eurozone data shows fragile growth</title>
      <description>New figures on retail sales and purchasing by companies underline that the eurozone's economic recovery remains fragile.</description>

      <body>Further evidence of the eurozone's fragile economic recovery came on Wednesday in two sets of data. Eurostat, the EU's statistics agency, said retail sales in the 17-nation bloc fell 0.6% in September from August. Meanwhile, Markit's composite purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell to 51.9 points in October from 52.2 in September. The reading was, however, still above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction. The sets of data came a day before the European Central Bank (ECB) is due to announce its latest decision on interest rates. September is the final month of the third quarter, so Eurostat's retail data could impact on official quarterly GDP figures. The eurozone emerged from an 18-month recession in the second quarter with growth of 0.3%, but other recent data has also pointed to a slowdown in the pace of growth. Howard Archer, chief economist at Global Insight, said: "September's relapse in retail sales fuels suspicion that consumers across the eurozone will likely remain pretty cautious in their spending in the near term. "Significantly, retail sales fell back sharply in Portugal - by 6.2% month-on-month - and Spain - by 2.5% month-on-month - in September". And he added: "German consumers have been generally reluctant overall to significantly step up their spending on a sustained basis in an uncertain environment." 'Pressure' Markit's PMI reading of 51.9 for October is an upward revision of an initial 'flash' estimate of 51.5 points published last month. But it was still down from September's 27-month high. Markit's chief economist, Chris Williamson, said the "loss of momentum raises concerns that the upturn is faltering". He said that data, coming a day after the European Commission downgraded its 2014 eurozone growth forecast to 1.1% from 1.2%, would make for sober reading at the ECB. The survey, based on some 5,000 firms in the single currency area, "piles pressure" on the ECB "to reinvigorate the recovery," especially with "concerns about deflation taking hold," he said. </body>

      <title>The Wall Street boss glad she was sacked</title>
      <description>A profile of Sallie Krawcheck, who used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street, before she was very publicly sacked on two occasions.</description>

      <body>Sallie Krawcheck used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street - before two very public sackings at the height of the financial collapse. Now the head of women's networking organisation 85 Broads, she says she's grateful she was fired. From 2007-2011, Ms Krawcheck held prominent roles at banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Those positions made her, arguably, the highest ranking woman on Wall Street. But, at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, she had very public clashes with Vikram Pandit, the then chief executive of Citigroup, over her insistence that the bank should repay investors who had lost money using defective financial instruments that Citi had created. Eventually, she was forced out - a fate that would once again befall her, just a few years later, after taking on the role of chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America. Although those firings certainly stung, they gave Ms Krawcheck an epiphany - she felt that in times of distress, companies react by closing ranks, and diversity, particularly gender diversity, suffers. "What I saw a thousand times during the downturn was, 'We'd like to give her that opportunity, but we need to go with the sure thing - we can't afford diversity right now,'" she says. So now, as the boss of 85 Broads, Ms Krawcheck says her goal is to work in a more active way to correct the gender imbalance at the top. Ms Krawcheck bought 85 Broads for an undisclosed fee from its founder, Janet Hanson, in May. Created by a group of women who worked at Goldman Sachs' former headquarters at 85 Broad Street, it was initially created to mentor women in the bank. Now, it's exploded to a membership organisation with more than 30,000 paid subscribers from 130 countries. Ms Krawcheck is candid in acknowledging that her purchase surprised many people. "For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way," she wrote in a post announcing her purchase. "My standard response: 'Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I'm just focused on getting the job done.'" However, she says her first job - as a research analyst at Solomon Brothers in the 1980s - taught her to invest in what is supported by research. And she says research shows that "women are a phenomenal investment and that is true in almost any way you can define it". Ms Krawcheck cites data showing that companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity. However, despite those statistics, she thinks that gender diversity - particularly in the financial services industry - has stalled, mostly as a result of the fallout from the financial crisis. "During periods of stress, it's easier for all of us to be with people like ourselves," she says about Wall Street's behaviour during that time. "But eventually it becomes a shortcut." She thinks that as a result of this impulse to push out outsiders, bad decisions can often get made. "What I saw was a good deal of groupthink [during the financial collapse]," she says. "The same people, same types of backgrounds, looking at the same data coming to the same conclusion - which in this case was wrong." During that time, she adds, she was "talked at" a couple of times - but not necessarily listened to. She says that her goal at 85 Broads is to listen to the membership to figure out ways to convince Wall Street bosses and other large organisations that gender diversity is crucial to their success - that in times of stress, instead of closing ranks, companies should look for an outsider perspective. Furthermore, she wants to expand the mission of 85 Broads to invest in companies helmed by some of its members or by other powerful women. Ms Krawcheck is candid that while her two firings helped her crystallise what she wanted to do as an executive, it certainly wasn't easy to fall so swiftly, twice. "In my mind, I sat on my sofa in my sweatpants for nine months and waited for the phone to ring," says Ms Krawcheck, about the time after she was sacked by Citigroup. But she says she is grateful for both the highs - and the lows. "I've had a lot of ups and some downs and people have asked about how I've weathered them," she says. "I know for a lot of entrepreneurs there's a sense of optimism [in being boss of your own company]. I'd say the more overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude." </body>

      <title>Si Shen: Rebuilding PapayaMobile</title>
      <description>Games entrepreneur Si Shen of PapayaMobile explains why all start-ups need to have more than one platform for their products</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24749575</url>

      <body>Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families? One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of PapayaMobile, which produces games for mobile phones. Si Shen was born and grew up in China. Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot. Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise. When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist. But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas. Her mother's example influenced her heavily. Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. "He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.' And because of this dream, he changed the world." She remembers thinking: "That's so cool! I want to do something like that!" Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California. By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company. At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur. He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first. Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal. At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time. She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying "I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company." She got the job. After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008. They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market. After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise. At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular. Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone. The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point. "All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users." Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store. As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on. The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion. "Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.' That was a very serious situation," she remembers. "I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees. Everybody was looking at me every day. They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer." She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area. Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games. "Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone," she recalls. She was devastated. Her investors pulled out and she knew she had to do something fast. She quickly decided to take the risk of moving Papaya's games to a different mobile phone system, Google's Android platform. She took the chance because although Android was just getting established at the time, she knew "it was going to be big". Her bet paid off. Papaya's games proved popular on phones running the Android system. Later, after making some technical changes, the company's games were allowed back on sale through Apple's App Store. Ms Shen says she learnt a lot from the episode, gaining a better understanding of how the business world works and the dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket. "As a start-up, you cannot just rely on one platform, because one day if that platform tells you 'no', then you lose everything. You have to have back-up." She has also learned a lot about herself. Until then her whole business experience had been very smooth, and she had not known "the taste of failure". "That taught me that no matter what happens, if you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome." </body>

      <title>Australia's small farmers struggling with low prices</title>
      <description>Despite a bumper crop of spring produce, Australia's farmers are struggling against low prices, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24610074</url>
      <date>1383179185</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70713000/jpg/_70713043_tractor1.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A near-perfect growing season for small farmers in two of Australia's biggest food belt regions - south-east Queensland and Victoria - has produced a bumper crop. But despite a bountiful yield, there is a nasty sting for numerous family-run farms as oversupply has driven down prices. It should be a time for celebration for growers, who have become hardened to a relentless cycle of droughts and floods in recent years. Instead many are complaining that they are being paid less at wholesale markets than the cost of harvesting their crops. At Peak Crossing, south-west of Brisbane, Wayne Allum saw part of his 10-acre (four-hectare) property disappear under murky brown floodwaters last year, but has now enjoyed textbook weather conditions following a mild Antipodean winter. Yet still he frets about his financial future. "It's a hard game sending your stuff to the markets and then not knowing what you're going to get for it. It is stressful and disheartening," says the former truck driver, who grows tomatoes, lettuces, cabbages, courgettes, and spring onions. "Prices were terrible compared to what it costs you to grow them, get them picked, grade them, box them and send them to the markets," he adds. "I won't send my stuff to the markets any more." Instead, he sells his produce from the back of a truck parked under the shade of a jacaranda tree on the main road to take advantage of passing trade. "It's not a huge living," says Mr Allum. "I'm better off just growing what I can, do everything myself and just sell it at the farm for a profit and make a living that way." The number of farmers in Australia is shrinking, and it's not just the current domestic oversupply that is hurting the bottom line. The amount of imported fresh produce has reached record levels, and Mark Vogler, owner of the Aratula Markets in Queensland, says growers are facing unfair competition from overseas imports, which he says are of lesser standard. Mr Vogler sells fruit and vegetables from local farms and wants prices to be set by the federal government to guarantee those on the land a decent return. If not, he believes the sector will continue to contract. "To see how fast the farms are going backwards has been alarming," he adds. "The Australian public doesn't know about it yet. The problem is once we do lose the ability to feed our people locally, we'll have to rely on produce that has come in from overseas unregulated." Ausveg, the industry body representing 9,000 of Australia's vegetable and potato growers, which generates about 4bn Australian dollars ($3.8bn; £2.4bn) per year, believes that financial security for its members lies far beyond the horizon. Australian carrots are an unlikely hit in Singapore and the Middle East, along with asparagus, humble fresh potatoes and leafy greens. Last year, just 7% of Australia's fresh fruit and vegetables were exported, but Hugh Gurney from Ausveg wants that to change. "There is a lot of product entering the market, and it makes it tough for growers to get a decent price for their product," he says. "As a result the Australian vegetable industry is looking more and more to overseas markets to supply fresh produce to Asia and hopefully relieve some of the oversupply in the domestic market." Yet Australia is so big that conditions for growers vary immensely, as do the triumphs and challenges, including October's bushfires in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, where some of the worst bushfires seen in New South Wales tore across vast swathes of forest and farmland. Perched off the southern coast is the "apple isle" of Tasmania, so nicknamed because it has long produced large crops of the fruit. The island of course grows many other crops, and artisan farming has blossomed on the island state in recent years, where small enterprises beaver away making high-value, niche specialities, including hand-ground spelt rye flour along with boutique jams and relishes. Crucially, the industry has established direct links to the public, according to Jan Davis, chief executive of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. "The thing that our small farmers do very, very well here in Tasmania is build on that relationship directly with consumers. So we've got a very strong farmers' market and farm gate sector down here," she says. Tasmanian farmers are also leading the way on exporting extensively. "We have product going right across the globe into Asia, Europe and the Americas. Just about anywhere you can think of there is Tasmanian product on a table somewhere," Jan Davis adds. But Tasmania's optimism gives way to a sense of gloom in other parts of Australia. In Queensland's sugar capital, Bundaberg, Mark Presser, a fourth generation cane farmer, enjoyed a record crop last year, and is on course to harvest another reasonable yield this time around. Yet he too feels besieged by falling prices and growing competition from overseas, most notably Brazil and India, where production costs are far less. He also complains about protectionism in Europe and the US. "Some days you wonder why you are doing it. We've got that much money tied up (in the business) we just can't walk away," says the 47-year old farmer, who owns 270 acres (110 hectares) of land. "The majority of the people who live in the big cities have got no idea at all how hard it is," he adds. He warns about the fate of other family-owned operators. "There aren't too many little ones left," he says. "They are just standing on the edge of the precipice and are on borrowed time." </body>

      <body>Rangers have announced that David Somers has been appointed as independent non-executive director and acting chairman of the club's board. The club have also confirmed that their annual general meeting (AGM) will take place on Thursday 19 December. The chairmanship has been vacant since Walter Smith left the role in August. Rangers say Somers will "oversee the process of appointing a high calibre chief executive officer and further independent non-executive director(s)". Craig Mather left the role of chief executive last month with Bryan Smart also stepping down as non-executive director. Following the departures of Mather, Smart, Smith and non-executive director Ian Hart, finance director Brian Stockbridge and James Easdale were the only board members left. Rangers, who reported a £14m operating loss for the the 13 months to June, were due to hold their AGM last month but it was delayed after a group of shareholders seeking boardroom changes were granted an interim interdict at the Court of Session. That group want former chairman Malcolm Murray as well as Paul Murray, Scott Murdoch and Alex Wilson appointed as directors - proposals that must be on the AGM agenda following the court decision. In a statement to the stock exchange, Rangers described 65-year-old Somers as "a qualified accountant" who has "spent all his career in fund management and in addition has considerable experience in matters of corporate governance". The club say they hope that Somers will "form a unified board and provide stability for Rangers". "In order to allow time for the process outlined above to be progressed, the company will hold its annual general meeting on Thursday 19 December," read the Rangers statement. "Mr Somers will, in accordance with Rangers' Articles of Association, be subject to re-appointment by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders at the AGM." The statement went on to outline Somers' current partnerships and directorships with Ace Europe Life Ltd, Europe Arab Bank plc, FRS Pension Trustee Company and TCF Investments Limited. </body>

      <title>Sports clubs to get £10m boost</title>
      <description>A £10m investment to develop club sport in Scotland is announced ahead of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games.</description>

      <body>A £10m investment to develop club sport in Scotland has been announced ahead of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games. Sportscotland, the national agency for sport, said the money would help local clubs meet increased demand and pay for 50 new development posts. The funding will be distributed over the next four years. Sports Minister Shona Robison said the money would develop the club sport network and help the Games leave a "lasting legacy". Sportscotland said it expected local sports clubs to experience increasing demand in the run-up to the Games, which open at Celtic Park on 23 July next year. About £4m will be given to clubs across Scotland as part of the Direct Club Investment programme aimed at boosting membership and improving facilities to help high-performance athletes develop. About 50 clubs will be helped in the first year, with 11 already securing investment for projects in hockey, swimming, gymnastics, athletics, rowing and basketball. East Lothian Swim Team secured £30,000 over three years to employ a part-time performance coach to work with talented swimmers, while the Clydesdale Amateur Rowing Club will receive £33,739 over four years to employ a part-time junior development coach to work in local schools and club sessions. Meanwhile, almost £6m will be invested in 50 new regional development posts for the governing bodies which manage different sports in Scotland. Stewart Harris, the agency's chief executive, said: "The connection between school sport, club sport and high performance sport is crucial in our drive to provide more and better opportunities for people to become involved in sport and physical activity. "Our high-performance system is already providing results on the world stage. Our Active Schools Network is making a significant impact on school sport and Community Sport Hubs are helping unite local clubs. "Today's investment is a further commitment to grow the club sport network across Scotland by providing every opportunity for talented club athletes to flourish, and paving the way for our future champions." Ms Robison added: "With the Commonwealth Games less than a year away, this new investment will play a pivotal role in developing the club sport network across Scotland and will leave a lasting legacy that can be enjoyed for years to come." Scottish Conservative sport spokeswoman Liz Smith MSP welcomed the funding. She said: "The primary responsibility of those who fill these new posts should be to develop sport in its most diverse definition and, above all, help grow Scottish sport at a grass roots level. "We need to work harder to ensure that the beneficiaries of spending on sport are not just for what are considered the most popular sports. "If Scotland is truly going to address the country's obesity and health record, we need to encourage more Scots to take up sporting activity." </body>

      <description>Sheffield City Council announces Don Valley Stadium will be demolished later this month.</description>

      <body>Sheffield's Don Valley Stadium will be demolished later this month, a leading city councillor has said. Isobel Bowler, cabinet member for culture, sport and leisure, said it would be knocked down on 21 November. News of the demolition date came after a 5,922 signature petition campaigning against the stadium's closure was debated by Sheffield City Council. Don Valley closed at the end of September. It has been replaced by a refurbished track in Woodbourn Road. The petition, which called for the council to save "an iconic landmark of Sheffield", triggered a debate after receiving more than 5,000 signatures. Ms Bowler said: "The petitioners came to say that they had a vision and they could run the stadium at no cost to the council. "Whilst that seemed great they were never able to produce a plan to indicate how they would do this." She said campaigners had asked for the stadium, where Team GB Olympic gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill trains, to be mothballed for six months at a cost to the council of £180,000. "There was no evidence that they were going to be able to deliver what they hoped to deliver," she said. "At that stage what would have happened is we would have spent £180,000 and we would be back in the same position as we are now, moving to demolition. "So the decision of the council, after listening to the debate and respecting the petitioners' passion, was that we would continue with the policy that was decided in April. "The demolition date, which we will be writing to the group with, I've been told is 21 November." </body>

      <description>'I'm addicted to the excitement of building teams'</description>

      <body>The reasons that drive people to start businesses are many and varied. Some entrepreneurs are driven by a need to be the boss. They dream of creating a huge enterprise - with them at the top. Others see starting a company as simply a means to meet a particular need, and may find the business aspects boring and onerous. There's another set of company founders who not only love the challenge of solving problems, but also love the actual process of creating start-ups. The Californian serial entrepreneur Judy Estrin probably falls into the latter group. "I guess I'm addicted to the excitement of building teams," she says. Ms Estrin has been involved in the founding of eight businesses so far. She also has extensive experience of being at the top of some huge enterprises, through serving on the boards of companies such as Walt Disney, FedEx and Sun Microsystems. Ms Estrin says that, while she greatly enjoys and values her work with big companies, what excites her most is working in a smaller environment. "The best innovation happens when you have teams that are no bigger than a jazz band," she says. She says she did try to break her addiction to start-ups for a while - but what drew her back in was when her son got involved in launching a company. That business is Evntlive, a firm that streams live and on-demand concerts and events over the internet. The company has featured artists such as Bon Jovi, Moby, Wale and events such as the Mountain Jam festival. Pay-per-view costs typically range from around $3 to $11 (£2-£7), and vary depending on whether the concert is live or recorded. The enterprise seems to have entered a crowded marketplace, competing with many other streaming services from companies such as Netflix, and cable and satellite TV. However Ms Estrin believes that Evntlive can gain an edge over competitors by offering lots of extra features, such as additional content and integration with social media, allowing fans to communicate easily with each other during events. "We have what we call a 'buzz' feature, which is commenting and so everybody who's watching the concert can be commenting," she says. Ms Estrin studied at the University of California, Los Angeles, and subsequently at Stanford University, where she worked with Vint Cerf, one of the pioneers of the internet. Despite having offers to work at several big firms, she joined a small new company called Zilog, because "a friend of my father's said that the smartest people he knew were at that company". Zilog was involved in making silicon chips. Ms Estrin says she found it both exciting and enlightening working at a technology start-up. Something she found particularly valuable was being included in the customer feedback loop, something that could happen only because the firm was still small. "In a big company, the engineers are very separated from the problems of the customer," she says. Bitten by the start-up bug, Ms Estrin left Zilog in order to launch companies of her own. Together with her then husband Bill Carrico, she founded Bridge Communications, which was an early pioneer of computer networking devices. She went on to launch a string of other businesses. One of these, Precept Software, was acquired by technology giant Cisco. Ms Estrin joined Cisco, and spent two years with the firm as chief technology officer. But not all of her ventures proved to be successful - one company eventually had to be closed down. Ms Estrin says it was an "awful" experience, not so much because of the notion of failing, but because "this group of people were going to not have jobs the next day". Nevertheless, she says that failure is "an inherent part of entrepreneurship". It's difficult to learn and improve if you don't take some risks. Something she points out in her book Closing the Innovation Gap, is that not enough attention to the different levels of success. "You can be a mid-level success and you can still be having a lot of fun solving a lot of good problems, making money for your investors. Not every company is a Google or a Facebook," she says. After taking some time out to work on her book, Ms Estrin found herself drawn back in to the start-up world by her son, David Carrico, when he and his co-founders were setting up Evntlive. Mr Carrico says he's heard "horror stories" about involving family members in businesses. But he felt he needed to do what was best for the company, "and I didn't know of a better entrepreneur in my network that I could enable to be a partner in this". Ms Estrin provided initial funding herself, and after acting as an adviser and mentor, she formally joined the team as chief executive. She says the worst thing about working with her son is: "He calls me Judy instead of Mom… everything else is great." </body>

      <body>It seems unlikely that Dr Frankenstein's monster-making antics would shock people today in quite the same way they did when his story was published in 1818. Not because we've seen it all before, mind you. Rather, in a tech-savvy world, people increasingly expect connectivity and interaction as a matter of course. So bringing the monster to life is the least you might expect. If it sat up and could instantly tell you whether your train was delayed - now that might be considered impressive. Almost 200 years after the book came out, many businesses face exactly the same dilemma as the doctor in Mary Shelley's literary masterpiece. What happens if you're stuck with an inanimate object, but want customers to be able to interact with it? Just how can firms achieve the digital equivalent of a lightning strike and a maniacal screech of "It's alive"? Recent users of the Expressen app, of one of Sweden's leading national daily newspapers, may well have been surprised when an advert encouraged them to talk to it. They would have surely been even more surprised when the advert engaged them in a full-on conversation. According to the advert's designers, Nuance Communications, this is the first commercial example of an interactive voice advertisement. Nuance is widely believed to be behind Apple's Siri voice recognition technology (it isn't allowed to admit it though), but does confess to making Samsung's S Voice equivalent. "An ad on a mobile device is a very inanimate thing - people don't take much notice," says John West, principle solutions architect at Nuance. "If you look at adverts right now, be they mobile, print or broadcast on the web or TV, the individual stares at it, listens and possibly absorbs some of it. "The experiments we've done so far show that if you interact with the ad through speech the recall is far stronger," he says. "If you enter into a dialogue with something you become more engaged and you offer much more information because there's no clicking through or filling out forms." This opens all sorts of avenues to businesses that are always talking about engaging with the customer, but generally seem to be making it more difficult than ever to actually talk to them. Of course everything rides on the voice recognition actually understanding you and not, to your immense frustration, asking you to repeat yourself. Since Nuance is contractually obliged to keep the details of the advert secret and this author speaks no Swedish, this is rather difficult to test. Another of these voice adverts is being launched in the US this month, but its details too are being kept closely under wraps. "It will involve showing you a movie based around the product," explains Mr West. "It will tell a story, and ask you to make decisions that will drive the story. He admits he was originally dubious whether the company could keep people engaged in what is basically a five-minute advert. "But actually it shows off the product much better than an advert ever could because you look at the elements of the product in the order you want." As things stand voice ads are limited to mobile platforms - but what if you want a physical object, like a bottle or box to perform a similar feat of animation? Companies have tried to pull this off recently using augmented reality (AR) apps such as Blippar. For example, Heinz made its logo "Blippar-enabled", meaning tomato ketchup fans could scan the logo on the bottle in order to view a simple recipe book. Pepsi drinkers who looked at their bottles through the app saw the label on their bottle come alive, whereupon a magician would do a magic trick. But bringing brands to life in this way has not got everyone convinced. "The flash-and-dazzle approach is not sustainable," maintains Ryan Matzner, from New York-based mobile development company Fueled. "Big brands like Heinz tend to ignore the fact that consumers are not so easily distracted these days," he says. "How many people are actually willing to sit and wait while an app downloads so that they can get a recipe off a Ketchup bottle?" Blippar, with over three million app downloads and a total of 18.5 million interactions, would answer "lots". Alan Parker, managing director at digital advertising consultancy Lowe Epic, cites the Ikea AR catalogue as an example of successfully implementing the technology. The Swedish flat-pack behemoth's 2014 catalogue will allow shoppers to see what its products would look like in their homes through mobile devices. "That's genuinely of use to the consumer and does fit in with their behavioural pattern - they really do want to see what that sofa would look like in their living room," says Mr Parker. However, just seeing things is only the start. IBM predicts that in five years we will have the ability to "touch" a product through our mobile devices. Its scientists are working on using special vibration patterns to simulate touch, such as the texture and weave of a fabric. But what if an inanimate object interacts with you and you don't know it? In June, Renew London equipped recycling bins in the UK's capital with technology to track people's smartphones as they passed by. Renew fitted the devices into 12 "pods", which featured LCD advertising screens, to collect footfall data by logging nearby phones. The City of London Corporation later demanded the technology be turned off, though Renew chief executive Kaveh Memari said the bins had only recorded "extremely limited, encrypted, aggregated and anonymised data". Nonetheless, on occasions like this, it feels a bit like time to pick up a pitchfork and flaming torch, hook up with a restless mob and send the monster back from whence it came. Sometimes, perhaps, it's better not to play digital god. </body>

      <title>Would you bring your parents to work?</title>
      <description>What happened when I brought my mum to work</description>

      <body>For two decades, millions of companies, predominantly in North America and Europe, have invited staff to bring their offspring to the office for a taste of grown-up working life, for one day a year. Feminist and writer Gloria Steinem and the Ms. Foundation for Women in the US began the promotion of the day in 1993, so daughters could accompany parents to work, improve their professional aspirations, and their self-esteem. It was expanded to include boys 10 years later. So what about parents curious about what their adult children are getting up to all day? Is there a value in putting faces to names, and in seeing firsthand what sons and daughters are talking about when the topic of work is discussed over family dinners? LinkedIn, the professional networking site, has designated 7 November the day the tables are turned, and launched the first "Bring In Your Parents Day". So what about life in the BBC's Business and Economics newsroom? I asked my mother, Patricia, to come in and see what I do, after years of her hearing me speak in "BBC jargon" about the world of news. She had a long career as an orthoptist, looking after eye problems, and is recently retired. Her initial response was a little lukewarm. In a text she asked, "How long do I have to stay?" So instead of subjecting her to a 10-hour news shift, she came in just after lunch. It was, touchingly, a cause of unexpected excitement amongst the online team. Though I feared that my well-meaning mother would be unable to stop herself tidying some of the messier desks in the office. She might also notice her empty cake tin that I keep forgetting to return months after I'd made muffins for colleagues. (She did.) When she arrived, Twitter's shares had just started trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a big story for the department, which we have been following closely. So I had to temporarily abandon my mother, before a colleague could take over from me. "Everyone looks very busy," Mum says. "Also because it's about business, it's not a world that I am familiar with. There's a lot of terms and words that we don't use in everyday life." She adds that seeing things from the inside helps to "make clear the pressure of deadlines in this kind of environment". She was also surprised to see correspondents and editors that she'd previously seen on TV, like Robert Peston, sitting inches away from the rest of us. Companies in 14 countries are taking part in Bring In Your Parents Day. From ZSL London Zoo to public relations firms and even some in the banking sector, parents are spending the day in the offices of their not-so-little darlings. Liam Fay-Fright from the advertising agency Mother, where his staff are taking part in the initiative, says his company sees it as an opportunity to remind their staff of a world outside a creative media "bubble". "I think having our parents around for the day will help to keep us all grounded." Is he worried that this will be a day where not a lot of work will be done? "The loss of productivity will be made up for in gaining an insight and a reality check for the people who work in advertising," he says. "Meeting people's parents is always interesting anyway, and people do find it hard to explain to their parents what it is they do." Darain Faraz, from LinkedIn's press team says the idea came after a colleague repeatedly failed to properly explain what she does to her mother. "About six months ago we were chatting and a colleague said her mother had asked her to write a paragraph about what it is they do. I do think there's a disconnect with the generations when it comes to the world of work. Especially in media and online companies." So what are my mother's conclusions on my job? "It does seem quite tense as there are a lot of breaking news stories," she says. As well as being surprised to see so many different things going on in the one room. "It is also really good to put faces to names, especially when it comes to the bosses. "I am glad I came." As Linkedin's Darain Faraz says: "It is maybe a bit like a grown-up parents evening." </body>

      <title>Should women improve networking skills?</title>
      <description>Should female executives take up golf and poker?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24801975</url>

      <body>There is a widely held belief that women are generally better than men at developing and maintaining relationships. But many women seem unable to transfer those skills to the business world, where the same activity is commonly called "networking". "Part of the cause is that women value authenticity in relationships," says Deborah Gillis, chief operating officer for Catalyst, a women's business research and advocacy group. "Sometimes the notion of meeting someone and then looking to them for help, or advice, or contacts in business, often feels just a little uncomfortable. Men seem to do it much more naturally." Experts have various explanations as to why this might be, but they are agreed on one important point - informal networks are critical to success, and more women need to learn how to benefit from them. "Women need to think about networking as a business skill," says Ms Gillis. "And just as we would focus our attention on developing other skills that are important to our success, we should spend time and care in building our confidence and ability to network effectively." But becoming a part of informal groups - especially those dominated by men - can be difficult, as technology blogger and consultant Vanessa Fox discovered when she left Google to start her own company in Seattle. As one of the industry's few female experts on search engine optimisation, she had to overcome both professional and social barriers - and that meant learning how to play poker. "I would go to these poker games, and I was always the only woman there," she says. "It's not that the men exclude women - they actually invited me - it's that women either don't know about [these activities], or they're intimidated. "I think they have this idea that men can automatically play poker. But actually men can't play poker either, and a lot of women I know are really good at math - more so than the guys." But the game itself isn't as important as the conversations that naturally develop, she says. "They tell you what their start-up does and what they're doing, and so you get to know people. And because of my experience, a lot of these guys then want to meet up with me because they want my advice - and that's when you start to build relationships outside of the more formal events." Ms Fox is the first to point out that such an approach isn't for everybody, but adds that she had little choice. "I've had to join men's networks because that's what was out there," she says. "The tech start-up world happens to be mostly men, and it happens that they want to play poker. "They're not actively saying they're going to try to find a thing that women don't like - they just want to have a good time." Sport has also become a popular networking tool for women. "If you can speak sport, talk sport, in an authoritative way where you actually watch it, and follow the game and you're passionate about it, it allows you to be one of the gang and gets you into the circle you can't get into any other way," says Susan Spencer, a former manager at American football team Philadelphia Eagles. She says sport offers a "safe" subject for women to talk about with their male counterparts. Ms Spencer adds: "If you go out for drinks you don't want to talk about politics, that's a deadly one, you're not going to do boy talk with a load of sexual innuendoes because that takes you down a road you don't want to go - it has to be sport!" Jenn Harris has taken the idea a stage further with the launch last year of High-heel Golfer. Based in San Diego, she travels all over the country offering workshops to women who want to use the game to develop better business relationships. "I don't think of the golf course as a man's world. I think of it as a place to learn about someone else," she says. "All the little things that happen are ways to see who that person really is - how do they react after a shot, do they cheat, do they have integrity? You can't get that over drinks at a happy hour." A keen golfer since the age of seven, Ms Harris cites her own experience as proof of the power of golf. While working for a defence contractor she needed to get to know military commanders and other executives who all enjoyed playing. She joined them on the golf course, and attributes her subsequent success to the contacts she made. "I was promoted within nine months, was put on every big project over the next two years, and later, when budget cuts were made, the clients made it known that I shouldn't be fired - all because of that relationship I developed on the golf course," says Ms Harris. But employment expert Jean Martin says that unless women actually enjoy playing golf, the game is unlikely to be much use as a networking tool. "The number one element of a successful informal relationship is that the individuals are true to themselves. So doing something that you're not interested in just to be with people ultimately creates an artificial founding of the relationship," she says. Ms Martin is executive director of human resources at CEB, a global business advisory company with headquarters in Washington DC. She says research has demonstrated that effective networking can increase business performance by 30%. As a result, companies themselves are looking at ways to increase networking opportunities for women that highlights their different interests. "Rather than everyone trying to be the same, all on the golf course together, our data suggests that companies which have a lot of people with a lot of different interests and perspectives are significantly advantaged," she says. However, other studies still often show that professional women need to improve their networking skills. A 2011 report by the Toulouse School of Economics in France concluded that a major factor behind female directors earning 17% less than their male counterparts was the fact they were less good at building a network. The study found that in general the male directors had much larger networks of past acquaintances, while female directors instead focused on a few strong relationships. As she tries to build her own business, Jenn Harris attends five to six networking events every week - but says it's important not to make new contacts if you don't have time to follow them up. Vanessa Fox says she tries to be selective. "It is work for sure, and in my case there are some events that I know I'll hate and I just don't go," she says. "I try to find things that are a little more of a balance that I can enjoy and find valuable." </body>

      <title>Twitter: It's worth how much?!</title>
      <description>How do you value a company like Twitter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24819238</url>

      <body>Twitter's much-anticipated launch on to the markets is fizzing with fanfare and debate over how - given that it has never made money - the microblogging site, priced at $26 per share, is officially worth more than $18bn (£11bn). The facts seem to contradict themselves. Twitter's growth is slow, and it shows no sign of making a profit - its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier. And more than half of its total registered users don't even use it. But some analysts predict that in the months post-share sale, the seven-year-old company's worth will increase to $20bn and beyond. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than double the likes of global carmaker Fiat, with its very modest-sounding market capitalisation of 6.9bn euros ($9.3bn). But Twitter is not alone in its sector when it comes to big price tags, if not profits. Online "scrapbooking" website Pinterest was valued at $3.8bn in October after its latest round of investment, giving it the same value, in terms of market capitalisation, as the UK's second largest house-builder Barratt Homes. Yet while Barratt has reported a full-year pre-tax profit of £192m for 2012-13, Pinterest has never made any money. Its digital "pinboards" may be attracting users, there may be talk of advertisers paying for posts, but it has no revenue yet. So why do these social media companies have this value attached to them? Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told the BBC it was a bit like buying a house. "You look at what other people are paying for something a little bit like what you are buying," he said. "[But] you have to think about whether you are going to price [the company] or value it." Twitter, Mr Damodaran believes, is being priced by bankers and brokers - not valued - and that pricing is coming from comparing it to its peers. By this he means that value is something more complex and emotional, but that pricing is based on at-the-time comparisons. Most notably, with Facebook. "The big difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook was making money [when it launched its IPO in 2012] and Twitter is losing money," said Mr Damodaran. Facebook had a billion active users when it launched its shares. While Twitter is growing its user base rapidly - up 39% over the past year to 500 million - only 232 million of these are active each month. According to a recent report by analysts Pew Internet, 72% of internet users in the US use social networking sites, but just 18% use Twitter. Plus, while users are invited to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters, many do not engage on the platform at all, leaving their registered accounts dormant. Others prefer to simply follow news feeds and favourite celebrities instead. This can cut the amount of time people spend on the site, and in turn the opportunities for advertisers to catch their attention. Facebook's IPO famously ran far from smoothly, and its shares quickly halved in price, before recovering slowly over the next two years. "Twitter is also entering a more crowded market than Facebook," said Mr Damodaran, "and there are many more queuing up to join." Therefore, he added, Twitter should be valued at about $10-15bn. He wrote recently that "at $20 billion, it is a moon shot". Chris Orndorff, who manages billions of dollars for clients at Los Angeles-based Western Asset Management, believes value is a lot to do with cash flow. "One of the best ways to value a company is to figure out the present value of the cash flows," he said. "For a more mature company, this is easier to do because they have a history of earnings, and generally reliable predictions about future earnings and cash flows. "Relatively new companies do not have the history." Therefore, he added, the stock was more likely to be volatile. "The susceptibility of social media companies to changes in consumer tastes also makes valuing those companies much more challenging," he said. Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of the travel website Lastminute.com, told the BBC she was confident Twitter could make money and hold its value. "Yes it is a scrabble for revenue," she said, but the company "has an astonishing amount of money in the bank". Advertising income from mobiles, rather than desktop computers, now accounts for over 70% of advertising revenue, and here, believes Ms Lane Fox and others, Twitter may be able to flourish. She also predicted "a huge number of interesting deals and partnerships" that could boost it further. A lot of the "value" or pricing of these companies depends on a future demand for services, as well as possible advertising streams. But, as past deals demonstrate - that future isn't always predictable. Famously, ITV bought the website Friends Reunited for £175m in 2005, but in 2009 Brightsolid paid ITV just £25m for the site. It had been superseded. Its "value" had been eroded. Its customers, the key to any company, had, in large numbers, moved on. Similar problems were encountered at one of the early social media pioneers, MySpace. In 2005 News Corp purchased MySpace for $580m. When it was sold in 2011, its price tag had fallen to a reported $35m. It too had been overtaken, and users abandoned its offering. But, for San Francisco-based CBS technology analyst Larry Magid, these cautionary tales make the newer clutch of technology companies stronger. "MySpace is a constant reminder that a high and mighty service can lose its lustre. However, the lessons of MySpace were not lost on Facebook, Twitter and services that followed," he said. "I think the difference [now] is the execution and the demographics. To succeed, Twitter needs a diversified audience that transcends a particular demographic. MySpace was focused on youth - a particularly fickle audience." Mr Damodaran said: "A lot of very valuable companies today - including Google - were once small, money-losing companies." And Mr Orndorff agreed: "The valuation is reasonable if the company can continue to grow its user base, generate cash flow from advertising, and successfully fend off the competition. If not, then it will be remembered - or forgotten - like many of the 1998-99 tech bubble companies, and generate plenty of tax losses for investors." </body>

      <title>Phosphorus: Farming's dirty secret</title>
      <description>The looming fertility crisis you've never heard of</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24823266</url>

      <body>Is it the biggest looming crisis that you have never heard of? Since 1945, the world's population has tripled to seven billion, and feeding that population has relied increasingly on artificial fertilisers. One of the most important fertilisers - phosphates - comes from an ore that is in limited supply. It is mined, processed and spread on to our fields, whence it is ultimately washed away into the ocean. So what will happen if one day we run out of the stuff? "Crop yields will drop very, very spectacularly," chemist Andrea Sella, of University College, London, told Wednesday's Business Daily programme on the World Service. "We will be in very, very deep trouble. We have to remember that the world's population is growing steadily, and so demand for phosphorus is growing every year." As Andrea explains, phosphorus is essential for life. The element - which is so reactive that it spontaneously combusts in its pure form - is used by plant and animal cells to store energy. It also forms the backbone of DNA, and it is an essential ingredient of our bones and teeth. Farming without it is not a realistic option. While this may sound rather alarming, there are two important caveats. First, the supply of phosphates is forecast to last for many decades, if not centuries, to come. So humanity is at no immediate risk of running out of the means to feed itself, even at the current rate at which it is gobbling up phosphates. Second, one of the biggest problems with phosphates over the past 60 years is arguably that they have been far too cheap and abundant. There has been no incentive to use them sparingly. Only a small fraction is actually absorbed by plants, much is washed off by rain. And this glut of fertilisers being washed into river systems, both phosphates and also nitrates, has created a nasty environmental problem - eutrophication. This is where the abundant nutrients feed algae in rivers and ponds, creating blooms that turn the water green. The algae then dies providing a feast for microbes, which in turn multiply and suck the oxygen out of the water, killing off all the fish and other animal and plant life. It is a common problem in the lower reaches of major rivers such as the Thames and Rhine in Europe, and Yangtze in China. Similar algal blooms occur in our oceans, where large areas - notably the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Mexico - have become "dead zones". Purely from an environmental perspective, the price of phosphates has clearly been too low. Yet this now appears to be changing. The price of phosphate ores has risen fivefold over the past decade as demand, particularly from the developing world, has grown steadily. Meanwhile, the cost of fertiliser production has also risen as the richest, cheapest phosphate seams have already been mined. "Commodities are priced on the cost of extracting the next tonne that you need," says Jeremy Grantham, of US fund managers Grantham Mayo van Otterloo. "It is a hopelessly bad system. "As long as we can mine a vital resource cheaply, we will price it cheaply, and run through the reserves until they become very expensive. And then we'll start to conserve." There are various options: And then there is the sewage option. Why not just capture the phosphorus from our own waste and recycle it? Sweden and Germany have been leading the way. There is also a cottage industry among the eco-friendly in Western countries of "compost toilets". Now the UK's Thames Water is getting in on the act, launching a new "reactor" that turns sewage sludge into nice clean fertiliser pellets. How much of future supply could ultimately be provided by recycling is open to debate - Thames Water says 20% using the current technology. But perhaps the more important point lies in the fact that, as a private-sector company, Thames Water is not acting from the goodness of its heart. It and Canadian partners Ostara, who developed the technology, expect to make a profit from selling the pellets, as well as from saving the cost of cleaning and replacing pipes that have become blocked by a phosphorus-based sediment called struvite. Any benefits, as far as the environment or the long-term sustainable usage of a limited resource are concerned, are but a happy by-product. The important point is that it is the rising price of phosphates that has made it worthwhile to start recycling the stuff. So should we welcome the higher price? Well, it depends who you are. In general, the lower your income, the more of it you spend on food and therefore the more sensitive you are to the higher food bills that might come with more expensive fertilisers. In other words, rising phosphate prices hurt the poor most, which is hardly a recipe for social cohesion. And that goes for whole countries too. As Jeremy Grantham points out, many North African countries depend on food imports, and rising food prices contributed to the discontent behind the 2011 Arab Spring. Ironically, one of those countries is Morocco. Ironically, because by a freak of geography Morocco controls about three-quarters of the world's remaining good quality phosphate reserves. "Morocco has the most impressive quasi-monopoly in the history of man," says Mr Grantham. "It makes oil look unimportant in comparison." That could make Morocco a very rich nation in future, one that the rest of the world will be keen to court. And it gives the country a great responsibility in pricing its product in a way that eventually weans the world off it in a manageable way - much like Saudi Arabia and oil. Ironically, the higher prices that monopolists like to set may actually be what the planet needs. But Morocco's unique position could also make it a centre of intrigue. For example, much of its phosphates are actually located in the territory of Western Sahara. It is occupied by the Moroccan military, which currently has an uneasy ceasefire in place with the local Algerian-backed Saharawi resistance. This poses moral questions for the multinational companies that mine the stuff there, as well as some obvious strategic issues for the rest of the world about securing future food supplies. Mr Grantham points out that half of nearby Mali - admittedly the sparsely populated Saharan half - was recently briefly overrun by militants affiliated with al-Qaeda, and he warns that Morocco itself may one day become the scene of rising social tensions, terrorism, or revolt. "I would almost guarantee to you that the major militaries of this world are well aware of this problem. "They would not allow Morocco to become a hopelessly failed state," he says reassuringly. "You don't want to look forward to the great fertiliser wars of 2042." You can listen to Business Daily on BBC World Service at 08:32 GMT and 15:06 GMT. </body>

      <title>Monster storm roars into Philippines</title>
      <description>Typhoon Haiyan, the world's strongest storm of the year, makes landfall in the Philippines with winds of up to 314 km/h (195mph).</description>

      <body>Typhoon Haiyan is battering the central Philippines with sustained winds of 314 km/h (195mph). Meteorologists say that if initial estimates based on satellite images are borne out, it could be the most powerful storm ever to make landfall. The storm has forced millions to seek shelter in 20 provinces and at least three people have died, officials say. The region was already struggling to recover from a powerful earthquake last month. The authorities have warned that more than 12 million people are at risk from the storm - the equivalent of a category five hurricane - including in Cebu, the country's second largest city with a population of 2.5 million. Two people were electrocuted in storm-related incidents and another was killed after being struck by lightning, according to officials. Seven others were reported injured. Reports say power and communications have been almost completely lost in the island provinces of Samar, Leyte and Bohol. The storm - known locally as Yolanda - was not expected to directly hit the capital Manila, more than 600km (370 miles) to the north. Mai Zamora, from the charity World Vision, in Cebu, told the BBC: "The wind here is whistling. It's so strong and the heavy downpours are continuing." "We've been hearing from my colleagues in [the city of] Tacloban that they've seen galvanised iron sheets flying just like kites." Schools and offices closed, while ferry services and local flights were suspended. Hospitals and soldiers are on stand-by for rescue and relief operations. The extent of the damage remains unclear, with authorities saying phone-lines are down in many areas. The governor of the Southern Leyte province, Roger Mercado, tweeted on Friday morning that fallen trees were blocking roads, hampering the emergency effort. Roxane Sombise, a resident of Tacloban, in Leyte, told the BBC: "I think our house is actually shaking... I just want it to stop." Protestant pastor Diosdado Casera in Surigao City in north-east Mindanao said the city had missed the worst of the storm but there was a lot of damage. "The storm was very strong - although Surigao City was not directly hit we experienced its fury early this morning," he said. "The big buildings made of concrete were fine, but the houses made of wood and shingles and plywood have suffered a lot of damage, mainly to their roof." A spokesperson for the British Red Cross, Nichola Jones, who is in Tagbilaran in Bohol, says the typhoon had cut power and torn off roof tiles, but was "not too bad". "But I think to the North - that's the area that has borne the brunt. Those were the areas worst hit by the earthquake last month." In the worst-hit areas of Samar and Leyte, she says there are reports of collapsed buildings, including a hotel. "In Cebu they have had quite a battering and I spoke to our colleagues and they've had quite strong winds and are locked down in their hotels. They are waiting to see what the situation is." Jeff Masters, meteorology director at the private firm Weather Underground, said in a blog post that the damage from Haiyan's winds must have been "perhaps the greatest wind damage any city on Earth has endured from a tropical cyclone in the past century". Relief packages State meteorologist Romeo Cajulis told AFP news agency Typhoon Haiyan had made landfall over Guiuan at 04:40 local time (20:40 GMT on 7 November). The typhoon arrived with gusts of up to 275 km/h (170 mph), the Philippines' weather service said in its bulletin, issued at 05:00 local time (21:00 GMT). The US Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Centre, which typically gives higher readings as they are based on a shorter period of time, said shortly before Haiyan's landfall that its maximum sustained winds were 314 km/h (195 mph), with gusts up to 379 km/h (235 mph). Waves as high as 5m (15ft) could be seen from the islands of Leyte and Samar, Reuters news agency reported. The storm is forecast to move over to the South China Sea north of Palawan Island on Saturday, meteorologists say. In its path are areas already struggling to recover from a 7.3-magnitude earthquake last month, including the worst-hit island of Bohol. About 5,000 people are still living in tents in Bohol after losing their homes in the quake, which killed more than 200 people. Earlier, President Benigno Aquino warned people to leave storm-prone areas and urged seafarers to stay in port. "No typhoon can bring Filipinos to their knees if we'll be united," he said in a televised address. Meteorologists in the Philippines warned that Haiyan could be as devastating as Typhoon Bopha in 2012. Bopha devastated parts of the southern Philippines, leaving at least 1,000 people dead and causing more than $1bn (£620m) in damage. It is the 25th typhoon to enter Philippine territory this year.

      <title>Israel 'only Arafat death suspect'</title>
      <description>Palestinian officials say Israel is the only suspect in the 2004 death of Yasser Arafat, after a report said his remains had high levels of polonium.</description>

      <body>Palestinian officials say Israel is the "only suspect" in the death of leader Yasser Arafat following a Swiss report that said his remains contained high levels of radioactive polonium. The head of a Palestinian committee set up to investigate Arafat's 2004 death called it an "assassination". He said investigations would continue "to confirm all the details and all elements of the case". Israel has repeatedly denied any involvement in Arafat's death. Arafat's widow, Suha, has said she believes the latest report proves he was assassinated. However, she said her late husband had many enemies around the world and she could not directly accuse anyone. The Palestinian leader died in a military hospital in Paris in 2004 after suddenly being taken ill at his presidential compound in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "We say that Israel is the prime and only suspect in the case of Yasser Arafat's assassination, and we will continue to carry out a thorough investigation to find out and confirm all the details and all elements of the case," Palestinian committee head Tawfik Terawi told a news conference in Ramallah. It is not clear how the Palestinian investigators believe the poison was administered to Arafat, who was surrounded by guards and a close circle of aides at his compound. The BBC's Yolande Knell, who was at Friday's hearing, said that in response to that question, the head of the committee said there had been a lot of interviews and he had "security information" but could not make details public at the moment. A report by Swiss scientists said Arafat's remains contained eight times the normal levels of polonium-210. However, they could not confirm it had caused his death. His remains were exhumed last year following tests on his belongings that suggested he could have been poisoned. About 60 samples were divided between Swiss and Russian investigators and a French team carrying out an investigation at his widow's request. France began a murder inquiry in August 2012 after the preliminary findings of polonium by the Swiss scientists, who have been working with an al-Jazeera documentary crew. One Russian official said last month that no traces of polonium had been found. Our correspondent says some Palestinian officials have already called for a new international inquiry into Arafat's death. Scientists from the Vaudois University Hospital Centre (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland, had carried out a detailed examination of Arafat's medical records, samples from his remains and items he had taken into the hospital in Paris. The biological materials included pieces of Mr Arafat's bones and soil samples from around his corpse. Prof Francois Bochud told a news conference on Thursday that the high level of polonium detected "by definition... indicates third party involvement... Our results offer moderate backing for the theory of poisoning". But he added: "Was polonium the cause of the death for certain? The answer is no, we cannot show categorically that hypothesis that the poisoning caused was this or that." The scientists said they had been unable to reach a more definitive conclusion because of the time passed since Arafat's death, the limited samples available and the confused "chain of custody" of some of the specimens. Polonium-210 is a highly radioactive substance. It is found naturally in low doses in food and in the body, but can be fatal if ingested in high doses. Arafat led the Palestine Liberation Organisation for 35 years and became the first president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996. His official medical records say he died from a stroke resulting from a blood disorder. Suha Arafat said she had no doubt her late husband had been assassinated but refused to point the finger at Israel. "I can't accuse anybody. Everybody wants to accuse Israel - I can't accuse - I can't jump into conclusion," she told the BBC. "Now the case is in the French jurisdiction, I wanted to document this crime - this crime I want it documented for history, actually." </body>

      <title>S&amp;P cuts France credit rating to AA</title>
      <description>Standard and Poor's cuts France's credit rating again to AA, almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status.</description>

      <body>Standard and Poor's (SandP) has cut France's credit rating to AA from AA+. The moves comes almost two years after the country lost its top-rated AAA status. SandP said it downgraded France because high unemployment in the country was making it hard for the government to make important reforms which would boost growth, The French government responded by saying that its debt rating was one of the safest in the eurozone. SandP said it expected government debt to hit 86% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015 and unemployment to remain above 10% until 2016. The country's Finance Minister, Pierre Moscovici, said SandP had made "critical and inexact judgements". He said in a statement: "During the last 18 months the government has implemented major reforms aimed at improving the French economic situation, restoring its public finances, and its competitiveness." In theory, a lower credit rating makes borrowing more expensive. The return for investors buying French debt indeed did rise after the announcement. The yield on French government 10-year bonds rose more than 20 basis points to 2.389% from 2.158%. SandP said in its statement: "We believe the French government's reforms to taxation, as well as to product, services and labour markets, will not substantially raise France's medium-term growth prospects and that ongoing high unemployment is weakening support for further significant fiscal and structural policy measures." Our business editor, Robert Peston, said SandP was "very publicly criticising France for not doing more to lift its economy out of the economic doldrums and cut persistently high unemployment". He said that, coming on the back of yesterday's decision by the European Central Bank to cut interest rates to almost zero, to ward off the threat of deflation and a return to recession, it was more evidence that the eurozone's structural weaknesses are far from being fixed. The French Prime Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said France's ratings remained among the best in the world and that the agency did not take into account all the reforms made by the government. However, the downgrade could be the last for some time. SandP attached a "stable outlook" to France, which implies a less than one-in-three chance that it would change France's rating over the next two years. </body>

      <title>Kerry visit lifts hope of Iran deal</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry unexpectedly flies to Geneva to join talks on Iran's nuclear programme amid hopes a deal may be within reach.</description>

      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry is heading to Geneva to join negotiations on Iran's nuclear programme, amid rising expectation of a breakthrough. Mr Kerry had been on a tour of the Middle East, but changed his plans at the invitation of the EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. Iran's foreign minister said a deal could be reached on Friday. The Israeli prime minister said a deal would be a mistake and Israel would not be bound by it. The talks bring together world powers - the five permanent Security Council members plus Germany (P5+1) - and Iran. The West suspects Iran's uranium enrichment programme is a step towards building nuclear weapons - a charge Iran strongly denies. The BBC's Kim Ghattas, who is travelling with Mr Kerry, says his dramatic decision to change his travel plans and go to Geneva is a clear sign that a deal with Iran may be within reach. State department official Jen Psaki told the BBC Mr Kerry was going "to help narrow differences in negotiations" between Iran and the P5+1 (US, Russia, China, the UK, France and Germany). Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told CNN on Thursday that Iran would not suspend uranium enrichment completely but could "deal with the various issues on the table". The US confirmed some sanctions relief was being offered in return for "concrete, verifiable measures". "We can provide them some very modest relief, but keeping the sanctions architecture in place," President Barack Obama told NBC News. "So that if it turned out during the course of the six months when we're trying to resolve some of these bigger issues that they're backing out of the deal, they're not following through on it or they're not willing to forward and finish the job of giving us assurances that they're not developing a nuclear weapon... we can crank that dial back up," he said. But speaking ahead of meeting John Kerry on Friday morning, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said such a deal would be a serious mistake. "I understand that the Iranians are walking around very satisfied in Geneva - as well they should be, because they got everything and paid nothing. "Everything they wanted, they wanted relief of sanctions after years of a gruelling sanctions regime, they got that, they are paying nothing because they are not reducing in any way their nuclear enrichment capability. "So Iran got the deal of the century and the international community got a bad deal, this is a very bad deal. Israel utterly rejects it and what I am saying is shared by many, many in the region, whether or not they express that in publicly. "Israel is not obliged by this agreement and Israel will do everything it needs to do to defend itself and the security of its people." Israel considers arch-foe Iran an existential threat. Mr Netanyahu has said the international community should accept nothing short of a complete halt to Iran's entire uranium enrichment programme, the removal of all enriched uranium from its territory, the closure of its underground uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, and a halt to construction of its heavy water reactor near Arak. Mr Zarif said the sides could sit down by Friday morning to prepare "some sort of a joint statement" that would address three elements - a common objective, an "end game... in less than a year'' and mutual confidence-building measures. Iran's lead negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi, said the world powers had "clearly" accepted his country's proposed framework and were now discussing details. However, there was no official confirmation from the P5+1. Hopes of a long-awaited deal on curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions were given fresh momentum this year by the election of President Hassan Rouhani, seen as a relative moderate. Since 2006 the UN Security Council has imposed a series of sanctions - including asset freezes and travel bans - on entities and people involved in Iran's nuclear programme. Separate US and EU sanctions have targeted Iran's energy and banking sectors, crippling its oil-based economy. Iran wants the sanctions lifted. </body>

      <title>Anti-Semitism 'on rise in Europe'</title>
      <description>A survey of Jewish people in Europe says anti-Semitism is increasing, particularly on the internet, an EU agency finds.</description>

      <body>Many Jews in Europe say anti-Semitism is increasing, particularly on the internet, according to a survey by the EU's Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA). The survey of 5,847 Jewish people said 66% of those who responded considered anti-Semitism to be a problem. Three out of four respondents, 76%, believed anti-Semitism had increased over the past five years. The survey was carried out in 2012 in eight countries which are home to about 90% of the EU's Jewish population. Respondents in Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Sweden and the United Kingdom were asked to give "their opinions and perceptions on anti-Semitic trends and anti-Semitism as a problem in everyday". They were also asked about their personal experiences and worries about their own safety and that of family members. There was particular concern about anti-Semitism online. About three-quarters of respondents considered that to be a problem which is getting worse. A British woman in her 50s, quoted in the survey, said she had "experienced more anti-Semitic comments" since going on Facebook "than I ever have done throughout my whole life". She added: "This is very dispiriting. The speed at which hostile comments and misinformation can be passed around is frightening and leads to a sense of deep unease, which may not connect with the day-to-day reality of being Jewish in a diverse society." The survey found 29% of those surveyed had considered emigrating because of concerns about safety, with particularly high figures recorded in Hungary (48%), France (46%) and Belgium (40%). It found one in five respondents had personally experienced at least one anti-Semitic verbal insult and/or a physical attack in the year before the survey. Perpetrators of the most serious incidents were described as "being perceived as someone with Muslim extremist views, 27%, left-wing political views, 22%, or with right-wing views, 19%". Respondents said the most frequent comments made by non-Jewish people in the UK were: "Israelis behave 'like Nazis' towards the Palestinians" and "Jews exploit Holocaust victimhood for their own purposes" (both 35%). The survey showed significant differences between Western and Eastern European countries. In Latvia, only 8% said the Israeli-Arab conflict had had a large impact on how safe they felt, but the figure rose to 28% for Germany and was as high as 73% in France. FRA Director Morten Kjaerum said this reflected differing histories, as well as recent patterns of immigration. "I think that there is across Europe... a traditional form of anti-Semitism that goes back in history for a long time," he said. "But then we also see a particular sort of anti-Semitism reported by the respondents, namely the anti-Semitism which comes out of the conflict in the Middle East. And this is where you have to be careful: when do you have a legitimate critique of whatever your position may be in terms of that particular conflict and when would it be an anti-Semitic statement?" The FRA said EU countries should work "urgently" to find effective ways to combat online anti-Semitism. It called on public figures to condemn anti-Semitic statements. </body>

      <title>'Drunk' Toronto mayor in murder rant</title>
      <description>Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford says he was "extremely inebriated" in a video that shows him in a foul-mouthed rage threatening to kill someone.</description>

      <body>Embattled Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has apologised for a video of him making threats to commit "first-degree murder" against an unknown person. The leader of Canada's biggest city told reporters he had been "extremely inebriated" in the clip, which shows him apparently blowing off steam. It is the latest video controversy to engulf the mayor, who admitted this week having smoked crack cocaine. Councillors are stepping up their calls for Mr Ford, 44, to resign. The latest footage looks as though it was secretly filmed on a mobile phone. Robyn Doolittle, the Toronto Star reporter who has been on the story, told CNN the video appeared to have been shot over the summer, based on the context of some of the dialogue. In the clip, an agitated Mr Ford paces a room gesticulating during a foul-mouthed rant. The context of the clip is not clear, nor is the target of Mr Ford's wrath. He vows to rip out the person's throat, poke out his eyes and ensure his victim is dead. The mayor appears upset at someone who has called him and his brothers "liars, thieves". "No hold barred, brother," Mr Ford says in a raised voice. "He dies or I die." An off-camera voice eggs on Mr Ford, saying: "Mike Tyson!" After viewing the clip outside his office on Thursday, Mr Ford told reporters: "It's extremely embarrassing and I don't know what to say." "I hope none of you have ever or will ever be in that state," the mayor told members of the media. "The whole world is going to see it," he said of the clip. Allegations of drug use by Mr Ford surfaced in May when journalists reported seeing footage of him smoking crack cocaine. After months of ducking the question, Mr Ford acknowledged on Tuesday for the first time that he had taken the drug "probably a year ago" while in a "drunken stupor". He said he was "embarrassed" by his behaviour, but vowed to run for re-election. The mayor has not been charged, but city police chief Bill Blair has said authorities are in possession of a video that apparently shows Mr Ford smoking crack. On Sunday, Mr Ford admitted on his radio show that he had a drinking problem. He acknowledged having been "hammered" at a street festival in August and "out of control" drunk at city hall during St Patrick's Day celebrations last year. On Thursday, Mr Ford's mother and sister told a local television station he would not resign amid the scandal. "These mistakes, they aren't everyday mistakes," Mr Ford's sister Kathy said. "It isn't like it has affected his work." Asked whether she thought her brother was an alcoholic, she responded, "It depends on what you consider an alcoholic." Mr Ford's mother Diane acknowledged her son's behaviour was "not acceptable" as mayor, but said he had done good work for the city. She said he had a "huge weight problem", and said she had recommended to him he hire a driver and install an "alcohol detector" in his car. "You have to change, you have to show the public that you've changed," she admonished her son. "There's nothing that he can't recover from, and he will recover." Mr Ford's allies on the city council however say they have lost confidence in him. But officials in North America's fourth largest city cannot legally remove the mayor unless he is convicted of a crime. City Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, a member of Mr Ford's executive committee, said on Thursday he would amend a motion he has filed for the city leader to take leave of absence. The measure would ask Ontario province to pass an unprecedented law to remove the mayor from office. "Quite frankly extraordinary measures are needed in extraordinary times," Councillor Minnan-Wong said. "This situation is deteriorating, it's not going away." Canada's Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who is a Ford family friend, appeared emotional when asked on Thursday about the scandal. "At the end of the day he [Mr Ford] has to make his own decision about what he ought to do," said Mr Flaherty. "Certainly his family is helping him and wishing him well. That's all I can say." Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne has expressed concern about Mr Ford's personal issues, but she stopped short of calling on him to stand aside. </body>

      <body>Shares in the micro-blogging site Twitter closed at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26 each. That means after its first day as a public company, Twitter is now valued at a little over $31bn (£19bn). More than 13 million shares were traded once they became available an hour after the New York Stock Exchange opened. It is the biggest technology listing since Facebook in 2012. Twitter floated on the NYSE and not, as some initially expected, the technology-rich Nasdaq exchange, where the likes of Facebook are listed. It was a big win for the NYSE, which decorated its exterior with banners promoting the offering on Thursday. Twitter has more than 230 million users, but is yet to make a profit. Shares in newly-listed companies are often volatile on their first day of trading. Within minutes, Twitter's stock price soared more than 80% before closing just below its initial opening price of $45.10 per share. When Facebook launched on Nasdaq, its shares were priced initially at $38 each. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45. But its price later slumped. It only recovered those losses by 11 September 2013, when shares again touched $45. Its initial public offering (IPO) was also marred by technological glitches and delays. To prevent Twitter's stock sale from having a similar fate, the NYSE ran tests on 26 October using larger-than-normal share volumes. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise more than $1.82bn. The company, which invites users to send tweets in 140 characters or less, has 232 million active users. According to its IPO documents, these users send 500 million tweets a day. Twitter's financials have been under greater scrutiny since it announced its plan to float, especially given that the company is still loss-making. It lost $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. About 85% of revenues come from advertising on its site, and more than 75% of Twitter users access the site from their mobile phone. Mary Jo White, head of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently warned investors to be cautious of the metrics used by technology companies like Twitter, noting that investors have become overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of data. "In the absence of a clear description, it can be hard not to think that these big numbers will inevitably translate into big profits for the company," she said in a speech. "But the connection may not necessarily be there." Twitter's founders saw their paper wealth soar to $4bn in the wake of the stock surge early this morning, although boss Dick Costolo said that none of the founders would immediately be selling their shares. The company's co-founder Evan Williams has a 10% stake in Twitter, making him its biggest shareholder. That stake is now worth a little over $2bn. Jack Dorsey, another co-founder, also stands to make a fortune from the IPO. His 4% stake is worth more than a billion dollars. Another co-founder, Biz Stone, is thought to have made millions of dollars by selling share stakes over the last few years. Big fortunes aside, after the hooplah of the morning, it was very quickly was back to work: Twitter employee Melissa Daimler posted a photo of employees at their desk just hours after the NYSE bell was rung. </body>

      <title>Obama 'sorry' for health law flaws</title>
      <description>US President Barack Obama apologises to Americans whose health insurance plans have been cancelled as a result of his signature health law.</description>

      <body>US President Barack Obama has apologised to Americans whose health insurance plans have been cancelled as a result of his signature health law. In recent weeks, insurance companies have reportedly cancelled policies that do not meet strict requirements under Mr Obama's 2010 healthcare overhaul. "We didn't do a good enough job in terms of how we crafted the law," he said in an interview with NBC News. But a senior Republican labelled his remarks a "half-hearted apology". During his campaign for the passage of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, Mr Obama repeatedly insisted that people who liked their health insurance policies would be able to keep them. But it now appears that millions of people who purchased plans on the private individual market rather than receive health coverage from the government or their employers may in fact have to buy new, possibly more expensive plans. "I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me," Mr Obama said. "We've got to work hard to make sure that they know we hear them, and we are going to do everything we can to deal with folks who find themselves in a tough position as a consequence of this." The health law's supporters have said most people thrown off their health plans will be able to buy better insurance policies at better prices, especially those eligible for subsidies provided under the health law. The opposition Republicans, who have fought the president's healthcare law at every turn, have seized on the reports of the policy cancellations. Some have gone so far as to accuse Mr Obama of lying to the public during his campaign for the law's passage. Even some of Mr Obama's fellow Democrats have suggested the administration delay parts of the law's implementation, including a requirement that people carry health insurance or face a penalty. Mr Obama's remarks on Thursday came after weeks of serious problems with healthcare.gov, a website established under the law that is akin to a shopping site for private health insurance plans. Among other issues, it has been plagued by long wait times to sign up for an insurance plan and serious flaws on the back end where customers' data are processed and sent to insurance companies. Mr Obama has vowed the website will be repaired. The Republican response to Mr Obama's remarks was swift, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell saying "if the president is truly sorry for breaking his promises to the American people, he'll do more than just issue a half-hearted apology on TV". Thursday's television interview was the latest effort by Mr Obama to win public support for the embattled healthcare law. On Wednesday he travelled into the heart of Republican territory to seek cross-party support for the measure. "We are going to get this done," he told a crowd in Dallas, Texas. Aside from adding new coverage requirements for health insurance plans - the provisions apparently responsible for the cancellations - the law establishes the healthcare.gov medical insurance marketplace website and others run by the states, mandates that individuals carry insurance or pay a tax penalty, and offers subsidies to assist in the purchase of the insurance. It also expands eligibility for the Medicaid government health programme for the poor. </body>

      <body>The new head of the Pakistani Taliban, Mullah Fazlullah, has ruled out peace talks with the government, vowing revenge for his predecessor's death. A Taliban spokesman told the BBC the militants would instead target the military and the governing party. Mullah Fazlullah was named the new leader six days after Hakimullah Mehsud was killed in a drone strike. Mullah Fazlullah is a particularly ruthless commander whose men shot the schoolgirl activist Malala Yousafzai. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif came to power in May pledging a negotiated settlement to the insurgency. The government said a delegation had been due to fly to North Waziristan to discuss peace talks with Hakimullah Mehsud, but he was killed in the drone strike the day before. The Taliban leadership council, or shura, took six days to come to its decision. Its leader, Asmatullah Shaheen Bhitani, said: "We will take revenge on Pakistan for the martyrdom of Hakimullah. "The talks about peace between Pakistan and Taliban leaders is just a trap of enemies and to distract the masses. All political parties that are part of government are considered to be our enemies." Shahidullah Shahid, another spokesman for the Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP), told Agence France-Presse news agency: "Holding peace talks is not even an issue to discuss - this government has no authority, it is not a sovereign government, it is a slave, a slave of America. "Holding peace talks is a waste of time." Mehsud was killed when missiles struck his vehicle in the North Waziristan region on 1 November. The Pakistani government reacted angrily. Interior Minister Chaudry Nisar Ali Khan said that the drone strike was "not just the killing of one person, it's the death of all peace efforts". The Pakistani government has yet to comment on the new leader. When the news was announced, there was reportedly heavy celebratory gunfire in the area around Miranshah, the main town in the tribal area of North Waziristan. Mullah Fazlullah, believed to be in his mid to late 30s, led a brutal campaign in Swat between 2008 and 2009, enforcing hardline Islamic law that included burning schools, and public floggings and beheadings. A military operation was launched to retake the area. Mullah Fazlullah fled over the border into Afghanistan but Islamabad says he has continued to orchestrate attacks in Pakistan. He was accused of being behind a roadside bomb in September that killed Maj Gen Sanaullah Niazi, the top commander in Swat, along with two other military personnel. Mullah Fazlullah was known for his radio broadcasts calling for strict Islamic laws and earning him the nickname "Mullah Radio". In one undated video he pledges to do everything possible to introduce the laws, saying: "We will eliminate anything that will get in the way of achieving this goal: father or brother, soldier or police." The shooting of Malala Yousafzai in October 2012 sparked outrage in Pakistan and across the globe. The teenager had spoken out against the Taliban's restrictions on girls' education. She was airlifted to the UK for hospital treatment and now lives in Birmingham with her family. This year Malala, now 16, addressed the UN General Assembly and won the European Union's Sakharov human rights prize. Prior to the latest Taliban announcement, the BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Islamabad said that Mullah Fazlullah was not a member of the Mehsud clan and, if appointed, would face a challenge to control the Mehsud fighters, who make up the bulk of the Taliban's manpower. The TTP is a loose umbrella organisation of about 30 militant groups. Khalid Haqqani has been named deputy leader of the TTP, but he is not thought to be linked to the Haqqani network that is fighting Nato-led troops in Afghanistan. </body>

      <body>A man has been arrested in connection with a series of blasts outside a local Communist Party office in Shanxi province, police and state media say. The explosions, apparently caused by home-made bombs, killed one person and injured eight in Taiyuan on Wednesday. A 41-year-old local resident, who had previous convictions for theft, had confessed to the crime, Taiyuan police said on their verified microblog. Police said they found evidence, including explosives, at his home. There was no word on a possible motive for the incident. The blasts came ahead of a major economic planning meeting of the Communist Party's top officials that will start in Beijing on Saturday. Police named the man as Feng Zhijun, and said he had been arrested in the early hours of Friday morning. He had previously been given a nine-year jail sentence for theft, police added. On Wednesday, eyewitnesses told journalists they heard at least seven loud blasts during the explosions. Police also found ball bearings at the scene, suggesting they had been used in the bombs, state media said. A local journalist told the BBC he saw "many iron balls" and a few "finger-length long nails" at the scene. "There were also iron balls on the floor, marked with chalk," the man, who asked not to be identified, said. "I was very scared when I went there." Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi, a province in north central China home to large-scale coal mining, is home to more than four million people. Local police have announced the case "solved", but questions are already circulating on Chinese social media, where many appear dissatisfied with the police response, the BBC's Lucy Williamson reports from Beijing. Specifically, many are asking about the motive behind Wednesday's attacks, our correspondent adds. There have been occasions in the past in China where disgruntled citizens have targeted local government institutions. Tensions are also high in the wake of last week's incident in Beijing. A car ploughed into a crowd in Tiananmen Square in what the authorities said was a terrorist attack incited by extremists from the western region of Xinjiang. </body>

      <body>Rival Libyan militias have clashed in the capital, Tripoli, with heavy gunfire and grenade blasts heard in several parts of the city. At least 10 people are been reported injured. An unconfirmed report says one person has been killed. One militia is said to be loosely linked to the interior ministry. It has been blamed for the killing of a rival militia leader from Misrata on Monday and has come under attack in retaliation for his death. Late on Thursday, pick-up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns opened fire as they tried to storm the eastern Suq al-Juma district of Tripoli, witnesses quoted by Reuters news agency said. "There is no army to protect the simple people, [there are] bullets in the apartments and in the buildings, in our homes," Tripoli resident Khalid Youssef told the Associated Press. The attack prompted rival militiamen to fire rocket-propelled grenades. The Libyan government has been struggling to contain the numerous militias who control many parts of the country. Some are nominally attached to ministries but often act independently and often have the upper hand over security forces, correspondents say. Last month, Prime Minister Ali Zeidan was briefly seized by a militia group in Tripoli. Two years after the overthrow of Col Muammar Gaddafi, Libya still has no constitution and divisions between secular and Islamist forces have paralysed parliament. </body>

      <title>Europe at 'polio risk' from Syria</title>
      <description>The outbreak of polio in Syria could lead to the disease re-emerging in Europe according to an article in the Lancet journal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24854920</url>
      <date>1383877279</date>

      <body>Europe could be at risk from polio following a recent outbreak in Syria, infectious disease experts say. In the Lancet journal, two doctors in Germany say the cases in Syria - which had been free of wild poliovirus since 1999 - could endanger nearby regions. They say because only one in 200 people infected develops paralysis it could take a year of "silent transmission" before an outbreak is detected. In that time hundreds of individuals could be carrying the infection. Prof Martin Eichner, of the University of Tubingen and Stefan Brockmann, of Reutlingen Regional Public Health Office explain that most European countries use inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) rather than the live oral polio vaccine (OPV), because the latter can, in rare cases, lead to cases of acute flaccid paralysis, the main symptom of polio. Whilst IPV is highly effective at preventing polio disease, it does not give the same level of protection against the virus as the oral drops, so vaccination coverage needs to be very high. The doctors say that countries with low coverage such as Austria (83%) and Ukraine (74%) risk a sustained outbreak should the virus be introduced via refugees fleeing Syria. Polio vaccine coverage in the UK is at 95%. The doctors said Israel could also pose a potential polio threat. Prof Eichner told me: "Wild poliovirus has also been found in sewage in Israel and from samples taken from some symptom-free individuals since February 2013. Although there have been no cases of polio in Israel, tourists could risk bringing the infection to other countries." Dr Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: "The Syrian outbreak puts Europe at risk because of the way we give vaccines. In parts of the world where it is still possible to catch a wild strain of poliovirus, children are usually vaccinated with a live but genetically weakened poliovirus which gives excellent protection but has a tiny risk of changing back to the more dangerous form. "However, in parts of the world where polio has been eradicated, like the UK, children are usually given a killed vaccine. It doesn't protect quite as well but it cannot mutate, so it protects reasonably well while preventing polio from being accidentally reintroduced to a country. He added: "Vaccination is never perfect, so despite being vaccinated, a small percentage of children in the UK would be at risk of contracting polio if they were exposed to the virus. Until the virus is completely extinct, it is essential that we continue to vaccinate our children." Most of the 22 cases of polio-like paralysis in Syria (10 of which have been confirmed as wild poliovirus type) are among children below the age of two who were unimmunised or who had not received all three doses of vaccine. The World Health Organization warned last month there was a high risk of polio spreading internationally because of the movement of refugees across the region and low immunisation rates in Syria. Prof Eichner said: "The WHO wants to get rid of polio completely and had got pretty close until recent outbreaks. The fact that most of those infected do not display symptoms but can still spread the disease makes it a very hard virus to get rid of as it is like fighting an invisible enemy." So far this year 322 cases of wild poliovirus have been confirmed, more than half of them in Somalia. </body>

      <body>A Soyuz rocket carrying the torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics has docked with the International Space Station, as part of efforts to showcase next year's games in Russia. On Saturday, two Russian cosmonauts will take it on a historic first spacewalk. The torch will not be lit. The event is part of a rebranding exercise by Russia, designed to portray it as a strong, modern country, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Baikonur. The rocket left Earth at 04:14:25 GMT. It blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, crewed by three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata from Japan. The Olympic symbol will be handed over to fellow cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky, who are already on the orbiting station, when they go on the spacewalk on Saturday. "Our goal here is to make it look spectacular," Mr Kotov said earlier. "We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work." The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. It will not be lit aboard the space station as this would consume oxygen and pose a risk to the crew. The Sochi torch will then be returned to Earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year. It is all part of the elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It is also the most expensive one so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. In yet another minor setback, the flame has gone out several times since the torch relay began last month. </body>

      <body>A bill banning workplace discrimination against gay and transgender people has passed the US Senate with significant cross-party support. The Senate voted 64-32 to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, with 10 Republicans voting in favour. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called the bill an "important step" to "help end injustice". But its future in the Republican-led House remains unclear, as Speaker John Boehner has voiced his opposition. "Just as no one in the United States can lose their job simply because of their race, gender, religion or a disability, no one should ever lose their job simply because of who they are or who they love," Mr Obama wrote in a statement following the Senate's vote. Mr Obama urged the House of Representatives to pass the bill, saying it had "the overwhelming support of the American people, including a majority of Republican voters, as well as many corporations, small businesses and faith communities". "One party in one house of Congress should not stand in the way of millions of Americans who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do," he added, addressing House Republicans. Republican House Speaker John Boehner opposes the bill, arguing it could lead to lawsuits and hinder job creation. The legislation bars employers with 15 or more workers from making employment decisions - hiring, firing or compensation - based on sexual orientation or gender identity. The bill's passage in the Senate comes three years after Congress lifted the ban on gays serving openly in the US military, and months after the US Supreme Court struck down a federal law banning federal recognition of same-sex marriage. This week, the Illinois legislature passed a bill recognising same-sex marriage. If, as expected, the bill is signed into law, Illinois will become the 15th US state to legalise gay unions. </body>

      <title>US moves to ban trans fats in foods</title>
      <description>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to Americans' health.</description>

      <body>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to health. Trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils, are no longer "generally recognised as safe", said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulator said a ban could prevent 7,000 deaths and 20,000 heart attacks in the US each year. The FDA is opening a 60-day consultation period on the plan, which would gradually phase out trans fats. "While consumption of potentially harmful artificial trans fat has declined over the last two decades in the United States, current intake remains a significant public health concern," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a statement. "The FDA's action today is an important step toward protecting more Americans from the potential dangers of trans fat." If the agency's plan is successful, the heart-clogging oils would be considered food additives and could not be used in food unless officially approved. The ruling does not affect foods with naturally occurring trans fats, which are present in small amounts in certain meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats are used both in processed food and in restaurants as a way to improve the shelf life or flavour of foods. The fats are created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil, making it a solid. Nutritionists have long criticised their use, saying they contribute to heart disease more than saturated fat. Some companies have already phased out trans fats, prompted by new nutritional labels introduced in 2006 requiring it to be listed on food packaging. New York City and some other local governments have also banned it. But trans fats persist primarily in processed foods - including some microwave popcorns and frozen pizzas - and in restaurants that use the oils for frying. According to the FDA, trans fat intake among Americans declined from 4.6g per day in 2003 to around 1g per day in 2012. The American Heart Association said the FDA's proposal was a step forward in the battle against heart disease. "We commend the FDA for responding to the numerous concerns and evidence submitted over the years about the dangers of this industrially produced ingredient," said its chief executive, Nancy Brown. Outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the charge to ban trans fats in that city, said the FDA plan "deserves great credit". "The groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in New York City have become a model for the nation for one reason: they've worked," he said. </body>

      <body>Brazil has demanded an explanation from internet giant Google about private wi-fi data allegedly collected while photographing for its Street View maps. A court told the firm to present a reply by Saturday or face a daily fine of about $45,000 (£28,000) a day - up to a maximum of $450,000. US and European courts have already fined Google for illegally harvesting data through the Street View programme. Google says it has removed the data collection facility from the vehicles. The decision by a court in the capital, Brasilia follows a complaint lodged by the Brazilian Institute of Computer Policy and Rights. It based the allegation on similar cases in other countries and demanded that Google reveal if it also collected data in Brazil. The Street View project cars are equipped with cameras and antennas to take 360-degree photos of streets and houses, which are later stitched together and posted as online maps. Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo, Belo Horizonte and other major Brazilian cities have been photographed by Google. Earlier this year, Google agreed to pay a $7m (£4.3m) fine for collecting people's personal data without authorisation in the US. In a settlement with 38 US states, the internet giant agreed to destroy emails, passwords, and web histories collected by Street View cars between 2008 and 2010. Germany also fined the company 145,000 euros (£125,000) for illegally recording information. The country's data chief called it "one of the biggest known data protection violations in history". </body>

      <title>US hijacker returns from Cuba</title>
      <description>William Potts, who hijacked an American airliner in 1984 and forced it to take him to Cuba, has returned to the US.</description>

      <body>An American man who hijacked a plane in 1984 and forced it to fly to Cuba has returned to the US. The FBI said William Potts was taken into custody shortly after his charter flight landed in Miami on Wednesday. Potts, now 56, commandeered a commercial flight from New Jersey to Florida with 56 passengers aboard. He was a member of the militant African-American Black Panther movement and expected the Cuban government to give him guerrilla training. Instead, Cuba imprisoned him for 13 years for piracy. He later settled in Havana but was keen to return to the US. Before he left Havana, he said he was seeking "closure" by facing the US justice system, which he hopes will be lenient. "I'm ready for whatever. My position is, of course, I did the crime and I did the time, and the United States has to recognise that," he told the Associated Press news agency. Potts had been in contact with US diplomats in Havana, who, he said, had told him that he could leave on a charter flight to Miami on Wednesday. He expected to be handed over to US marshals upon his arrival in Florida. "What happens after that I couldn't tell you," he said. Potts was taken from the airport to an FBI office in Miami and is scheduled to make his first appearance in a US court on Thursday. In the 1960s and early 1970s, dozens of US planes were hijacked to Cuba as the Cold War with then-Cuban leader Fidel Castro intensified. But by the 1980s such incidents had become less frequent and Cuba swiftly convicted Potts. US officials have aggressively prosecuted some of the returning hijackers but gave significant sentence reductions to others who served time in other countries and pleaded guilty. After his release Potts remained in Havana, where he married and had two daughters. His daughters now live in the United States and Potts has sought for a number of years to return to his homeland. "Having completed my sentence, I feel like I want to put all that stuff behind me. I don't want that lingering over or impeding anything I might want to do. Once you've paid your debt to society, you're entitled to a fresh start," he said last month. But Potts says he does not intend to settle in the US: "Just as soon as I finish taking care of this business in the United States, I certainly have every intention of returning to Cuba to live." </body>

      <body>The commander of the M23 rebel group in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has surrendered in Uganda, sources have told the BBC. Sultani Makenga is said to have handed himself over along with hundreds of M23 fighters in the Mgahinga National Park. A Ugandan spokesman said no decision had yet been made on whether he would be handed over to DR Congo. Earlier this week the M23 said it was ending its insurgency, hours after the DR Congo government claimed victory. Reports say Col Makenga and about 1,700 fighters have been disarmed and are being held in a secret location. The BBC's Catherine Byaruhanga in Kampala says Col Makenga poses a tough diplomatic challenge for Uganda. He is wanted back home for war crimes for his leadership of the rebellion and is also under UN sanctions. A Ugandan government spokesperson told the BBC a decision on whether to hand him over would have to wait until a peace deal is signed between DR Congo and the M23 rebels, which is expected this weekend. Both DR Congo and the UN are adamant that the M23's top commanders will not be given amnesty, our correspondent says. Uganda has been hosting peace talks between the rebels and the DR Congo government. The M23 has wrought havoc across eastern DR Congo since it began its insurgency in April 2012. Its fighters are mostly from the Tutsi ethnic group, a minority in eastern DR Congo but with ties to Rwanda's leaders. Their name refers to a 23 March 2009 peace deal which a former militia group - the CNDP - signed with the Congolese government. The rebels said the government had not lived up to its promises in the deal. Analysts say the surrender of Col Makenga, if confirmed, will be a major success for the Congolese army which has been struggling to restore calm in eastern DR Congo for two decades. Earlier this year the UN approved a new mission of 3,000 African soldiers with a mandate to fight the rebels. They have the operational support of the existing UN Mission in DR Congo (Monusco) and have used helicopters to target the rebels, allowing the army to advance. Both Rwanda and Uganda have denied UN allegations that they supported the M23. </body>

      <body>At least two policemen have been killed by suspected militants in Indian-administered Kashmir, police say. Armed militants ambushed the policemen when they were leaving work at Awantipora, some 32km (20 miles) from Srinagar city, on Thursday evening. Kashmir has seen an armed insurgency against Indian rule since 1989. In recent years violence has abated from its peak in the 1990s, but the causes of the insurgency are still far from resolved. Thursday evening's incident took place when Congress party leader Rahul Gandhi was travelling in the region on a visit. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. India has a large security presence in Kashmir, with tens of thousands of police and paramilitary forces deployed in the region. And the hanging earlier this year of a Kashmiri man, Afzal Guru, on charges of plotting the 2001 attack on India's parliament, has triggered a fresh spate of violence. In September Indian security forces said they shot dead three men who stormed a police station and an army camp, killing at least 10 people. In May, four soldiers were killed in an ambush by suspected militants in Pulwama district. In March, two armed militants disguised as cricket players attacked a paramilitary camp and killed five troops. The militants were killed in retaliatory fire. Two people were arrested in connection with the attack. </body>

      <body>China's exports and imports rose in October, the latest in a series of figures indicating a recovery. Exports, a key driver of its growth, rose 5.6% from a year earlier, while imports jumped 7.6%. This follows data released earlier this month which showed that manufacturing activity in China grew at its fastest pace in 18 months in October. The numbers come ahead of key meetings of China's Communist Party, with economic reforms set to be discussed. Known as the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, the meeting will run from 9 to 12 November, and top leaders are expected to discuses reforming key areas such as the financial sector and state-owned enterprises. China's economy, the world's second-biggest, has shown signs of a pick up after seeing its growth rate slow in first half of the year. Its economy grew 7.8% in the July-to-September quarter from a year earlier, up from the 7.5% expansion recorded in the previous three months. Some analysts said the pick up had been helped by a recovery in demand from key export markets such as the US. "Combined with the better export data in Korea and Taiwan, China's export numbers suggests some - although not yet decisive - improvement in global demand momentum," said Louis Kuijs, an economist with Royal Bank of Scotland. Over the past few months Beijing has also announced stimulus measures aimed at helping exporters and boosting domestic demand. These include tax breaks for small businesses, reduced fees for exporters and the opening up of railway construction. Analysts said that domestic consumption in China was likely to pick up in coming months and help boost its overall growth. "Domestic demand is still holding up, which can be seen from the import growth, and the recent Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) figure also indicated that the domestic demand will continue to gain more steam in the coming quarters," said Sun Junwei, an economist with HSBC Global Research in Shanghai. Earlier this month, China also reported that its services sector, which accounts for almost 43% of its overall economy, grew at its fastest pace in a year in October, The positive data follows a rise in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment in September. </body>

      <title>Nissan's Ghosn warns UK over EU exit</title>
      <description>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn tells the BBC.</description>

      <body>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn has told the BBC. He was speaking in Sunderland, where Nissan employs 6,500 workers. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election in 2015. But Mr Ghosn also added that he considered the exit scenario to be unlikely. When asked how Nissan would react if the UK were to leave the EU, Mr Ghosn said: "If anything has to change, we [would] need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future." Mr Ghosn was visiting Sunderland for the launch of the company's new Qashqai model, which will be built there. Praising the Sunderland plant, Mr Ghosn said it was one of the most productive in Europe and said Nissan was "blessed" to own it. With sales of more than 240,000 last year, the Qashqai is Nissan's best-selling car in Europe. The car accounts for more than half the output of the Sunderland plant and Mr Ghosn says the new model "ensures" a lot of jobs in the city. Mr Ghosn, who is also chief executive of Nissan's sister company Renault, says that after five years of decline the European car market is arriving at "the end of the tunnel". He says that next year the European market should be stable with possibly a little growth. Action by the European Central Bank, including Thursday's cut in interest rates, could help that recovery according to Mr Ghosn. </body>

      <title>ECB in surprise interest rate cut</title>
      <description>The European Central Bank cuts its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25%, down from 0.5%, in a surprise move.</description>

      <body>The European Central Bank (ECB) has cut its benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.25%, down from 0.5%. The move came as a surprise to many analysts. ECB president Mario Draghi said the decision to cut rates reflected an outlook of low inflation and economic weakness in the eurozone. Inflation in the eurozone fell to 0.7% in October - its lowest level since January 2010, stoking concerns of deflation in some countries. Prices in Greece - one of the eurozone members worst hit by the economic crisis - have not risen since July. Some economists are also worried about deflation in Spain. The ECB's target is to keep inflation just below 2% - seen as a healthy level for economic growth. Speaking at a press conference after the announcement of the rate cut, Mr Draghi said the bank expected to see "a prolonged period of low inflation followed by a gradual upward movement towards inflation rates of below but close to 2%", and said the eurozone was seeing "weaker than expected economic activity". "Accordingly, our stance will remain accommodative as long as necessary," he said. He reiterated a pledge to keep rates low for the foreseeable future as part of the bank's new policy of offering forward guidance alongside its decisions. "Deflationary risks and the stronger euro seem to have motivated the ECB's move," said Carsten Brzeski, an analyst at ING. "It is obvious that the ECB under president Draghi has become much more pro-active than under any of his predecessors." Rates had been held at 0.5% since May, and before that were cut to 0.75% in July 2012. The cut in the benchmark rate is designed to make it cheaper for banks to borrow from the ECB, with the aim that this will be passed on to businesses taking out loans, boosting the economy. The 17-member eurozone returned to growth in the second quarter of the year, recording a 0.3% increase GDP. But unemployment remains high and austerity measures in a number of countries continue to hold back growth. The euro fell sharply against the dollar in response to the decision, dropping more than 1%. A weaker euro may be a help to the eurozone economy by making European goods cheaper abroad, benefiting exporters. </body>

      <body>The wife of deposed Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi, has visited him in jail and says he is "steadfast". Naglaa Ali was one of several relatives to visit Mr Morsi on Wednesday in the Borg al-Arab prison near Alexandria. Mr Morsi, an Islamist who was Egypt's first democratically elected president, is on trial on charges of inciting the killing of protesters during clashes in Cairo last year. The military ousted him in July. The trial has been adjourned until January. Fourteen officials from the Muslim Brotherhood, to which Mr Morsi belongs, are also being tried. "Thank God, it's just like I saw him yesterday. He is more steadfast and bold," Mrs Ali told the Associated Press on Thursday. "It was just as I expected," she went on. The ex-president is accused of "incitement to murder and violence" over the deaths of at least 10 people during intense clashes in December 2012 which followed a decree that gave him wide-ranging powers. After he was ousted in July, a sit-in protest in Cairo by Mr Morsi's supporters was violently broken up by the military, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people. The interim government has also cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, banning the Islamist organisation and arresting dozens of its senior figures. His supporters say he was removed in a coup and is now facing a politicised trial. Human rights groups accuse the security services of acting without accountability. </body>

      <body>Two suicide bombings have killed at least 16 people at a military base north of the Iraqi capital Baghdad. The bombings at the base in the town of Tarmiya left 39 more wounded. One bomber blew up a car laden with explosives at the entrance of the base before the second bomber struck inside the compound itself. Violence in Iraq is running at its highest level since 2008, with almost 2,000 people killed in the past two months alone, according to the UN. Among other attacks reported in Iraq on Thursday, three people were killed in a bombing on another army base in the town of Ana, some 250km (160 miles) north-west of Baghdad. No group has said it carried out the attacks, but suspicion will fall on al-Qaeda linked militants who often target the security services and Shia Muslims. The latest violence as Shia Muslims prepare to commemorate Ashura, which marks the martyrdom at Karbala of Hussein, a grandson of the Prophet Muhammad. The Shia-led government has been accused of failing to address grievances among the Sunni Arab minority, including allegations of abuses by security forces. </body>

      <title>NHS spends £700 insuring each birth</title>
      <description>The NHS spends nearly £700 on clinical negligence cover for every live birth in England, a report says.</description>

      <body>The NHS spends nearly £700 on clinical negligence cover for every live birth in England, a report says. The review by the National Audit Office said last year this cost nearly £500m - almost a fifth of all spending on maternity. Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge said the figure was "absolutely scandalous". The Department of Health said the NHS is one of the safest places in the world to have a baby. Having a baby is the most common reason for admission to hospital in England. The number of births has increased by almost a quarter in the last decade, reaching nearly 700,000 live births. The public spending watchdog said maternity services were generally good for women and babies, but there was still a lot of scope for improvement. Its report highlighted "wide unexplained variations" between trusts in rates of complications such as readmissions, injuries and infections. Laura Blackwell, director of health value for money studies at the National Audit Office, told the BBC the number of maternity claims had risen significantly in recent years. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: "There has been an increase in claims and we don't cover exactly why. It is the same across the NHS. "I think it's a complicated picture... further complicated by the fact it takes an average of four years for a claim to be settled... so it's quite hard to draw conclusions about the current state of care." The NAO also pointed to a shortage of midwives and consultants on labour wards. The report concluded that a further 2,300 midwives are required, though their distribution across England varies substantially. And although it said the level of consultant presence has improved, more than half of units are not meeting the standard recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The report noted that between April and September last year more than a quarter of maternity units were closed to admissions for at least half a day because demand outstripped capacity. Clinical negligence claims for maternity have risen by 80% in the last five years. The cost of cover last year was £482m, and the average payment per claim was £277,000. Figures from the NHS Litigation Authority released last year showed the health service in England paid out more than £3bn in compensation claims linked to maternity care between 2000 and 2010. Ms Hodge said: "I find it absolutely scandalous that one fifth of all funding for maternity services, equivalent to around £700 per birth, is spent on clinical negligence cover." She said the NAO report had shown an urgent need to improve maternity services. "The department needs to buck up and take responsibility for this. It needs to review its monitoring and reporting process to ensure that all relevant bodies can work effectively together to deliver maternity services that are value for money and fit for purpose." James (not his real name), a recipient of medical negligence money, told the Today programme the money had helped give his son a better quality of life. He and his wife did not claim for negligence until six months after the birth of their son, when they realised the costs involved in his care. Their son had been starved of oxygen during birth and now suffers from quadriplegic cerebral palsy, severe brain damage, visual impairment and epilepsy. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said the health service should always learn from any mistakes to improve patient care in the future. "The NHS remains one of the safest places in the world to have a baby, but on rare occasions care falls below acceptable standards and unsafe care should never be tolerated." He said the service was making progress. "This report shows that most women have good outcomes and positive experiences of maternity care. We know 84% of women now say they have good care, which has gone up from 75% six years ago. But we are determined to improve further." Royal College of Midwives chief executive Cathy Warwick said the report backed up what the college had been saying for a long time. "We are many thousands of midwives short of the number needed to deliver safe, high quality care. Births are at a 40-year high and other figures out this week show that this is set to continue. As the report states, births are also becoming increasingly complex putting even more demands on midwives and maternity services." Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Dr David Richmond said the NAO report raised valid concerns. "Although the UK is generally a safe place for women to give birth, we have known for some time that pressure on maternity services is growing in some areas, particularly inner city conurbations, placing stress on clinicians, managers and patients alike." </body>

      <title>Npower boss rejects bonus 'gimmicks'</title>
      <description>Amid controversy over rising energy prices, Npower chief executive Paul Massara dismisses forfeiting his bonus as a "gimmick".</description>

      <body>The chief executive of Npower, Paul Massara, has dismissed giving up a bonus in response to anger over rising energy prices as a "gimmick". In an interview with the BBC's Hardtalk, Mr Massara also warned of future power cuts unless there is a "stable environment" for investment. He said he earned around £600,000 a year, which includes a £150,000 bonus. On Monday Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw pledged to decline a bonus this year to help restore trust in energy companies. When asked whether he would match Mr Laidlaw's pledge, Mr Massara said: "I think the issue is, are we doing absolutely everything we can to keep costs down and to make sure it's affordable? "Gimmicks of saying 'I'm going to reduce my bonus' - If Sam was earning five million a year and he's willing to give a million, good for him. "My bonus is linked to my performance, is linked to getting it right for customers, is linked to employee satisfaction. All of my team are linked to that. If we don't deliver on that, we don't get a bonus." He said he thought the lights would stay on this year, but warned: "The amount of spare capacity to meet the peak requirement... has dropped from somewhere around 15% to five. "That is extremely low by historical levels... and unless the UK can create a politically stable environment to attract new capital, that new capital will not come in." On Monday Mr Laidlaw said the energy sector needed to urgently rebuild consumers' trust and to help do that he would not take a bonus this year. "Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it," he said. Recent increases of around 9% have caused anger and last month the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee summoned energy bosses to explain the steep rise in prices. In September Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to to freeze energy bills for 20 months if he is successful in the 2015 election. Energy companies complain that government policy is to blame for higher energy prices in particular "green" fees which are added to bills. Currently 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. Mr Massara told Hardtalk: "The more the government creates uncertainty with things like price freezes or other changes, it means there's less certainty and less likely for capital investment." </body>

      <body>International Airways Group (IAG), the owner of British Airways, has posted a rise in pre-tax profit to 609m euros (£507m) for the three months from July to September. The results are up from 237m euros for the same period in 2012. The company reported a pre-tax profit of 103m euros for the first nine months of 2013. This marks a turnaround from last year, when IAG saw a 121m-euro loss in pre-tax profits for the first nine months. Its Spanish airline, Iberia, struggled amid the economic crisis. Willie Walsh, chief executive of IAG, said a strong London and transatlantic market, the 2012 Olympic Games and prioritising cost control had helped British Airways. He said Iberia's performance had improved. Mr Walsh added: "However, the airline must continue to implement its restructuring plan and reach agreement on productivity changes to bring about long-term sustainable profits and growth." </body>

      <body>The Walt Disney Company has announced it will release the next Star Wars film on 18 December 2015. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, from creator George Lucas last year for $4bn (£2.6bn). It has committed to making at least three new films in the series, one of the most successful franchises ever. Disney announced the release date as it reported a better-than-expected 12% jump in net profit for the three months to 28 September. It made a net profit of $1.39bn during the quarter, up from $1.24bn during the same period last year. The company also reported that its net income for the financial year to 28 September jumped 8% from a year ago to $6.1bn. "We're extremely pleased with our results for Fiscal 2013, delivering record revenue, net income and earnings per share for the third year in a row," Robert Iger, chief executive of the firm, said in a statement. Disney's movie studio business saw a 7% jump in revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenues rose to $1.5bn during the period, helped mainly by the strong performance of Monsters University, which Disney said "partially offset" the weak showing of The Lone Ranger. However, operating income at Disney's cable network unit, which includes the ESPN sports channel, fell by 7% to $1.3bn in the last quarter, which the firm said was due to the timing of some ESPN affiliate fee revenues. </body>

      <body>Jermain Defoe scored a club-record 23rd European goal to give Tottenham victory over Sheriff Tiraspol and a place in the Europa League knockout stages. The England striker scored a penalty to move ahead of Martin Chivers and add to Erik Lamela's first goal for the club. Lamela finished calmly before earning Spurs their penalty when fouled by Djibril Paye after a mazy run. The hosts' defence was breached for the first time in Europe this season when Ismail Isa scored, but they held on. There was a sense of relief mixed with inevitability when Lamela hooked home on the hour as Tottenham, with nine changes from their draw against Everton, had laboured towards an expected victory. An uneventful first half gave hope to their Moldovan visitors, who have never won away in the Europa League, but a second-half double secured Spurs's sixth win in Europe this season and progression from Group K. Andre Villas-Boas's side are through two games quicker than last season - and the win extended an impressive run of form which has seen them lose just twice in 18 matches. Record signing Lamela was influential throughout and threatened tentatively in a first half void of clear openings for the home side. The Argentine had a half-hearted penalty appeal turned down early on before a long-range effort from team-mate Mousa Dembele forced the first save of the game from Vjekoslav Tomic. Spurs, though, struggled to penetrate the visitors and it was a quickfire break led by attacking midfielder Ricardinho which fashioned the half's best opening for the visitors as Isa's shot beat Brad Friedel but cannoned back off the post. Friedel was deputising for Hugo Lloris, rested after being knocked out in the draw with Everton, and the 42-year-old was able to watch on as Ricardinho then shot wide from a good opening. Defoe could not turn home Gylfi Sigurdsson's cross on the stroke of half-time, but his and Spurs's fortunes improved as Lamela gained in influence after the break. Christian Eriksen smashed a shot from range which drew a good save from Tomic before the Danish midfielder inadvertently found Lamela 12 yards from goal for the 21-year-old to finish crisply. The former Roma player's weaving run into the area drew a touch from Paye seven minutes later, allowing Defoe to lift his penalty high into the net in front of the watching Chivers. Five minutes later, Friedel could only parry Cadu's shot into his six-yard box allowing Isa to volley home a consolation, but Spurs comfortably held on and a point in Tromso in three weeks' time will likely prove enough for them to top the group. </body>

      <body>Defending champion Novak Djokovic beat Juan Martin Del Potro to become the second player to reach the last four at the ATP World Tour Finals. The Serb joined world number one Rafael Nadal in the semi-finals with a 6-3 3-6 6-3 victory in London. It was a 19th consecutive win for Djokovic since losing to Nadal in the US Open final in September. Del Potro and Roger Federer will battle for the second Group B qualification place on Saturday. "I will try to do my best," said Del Potro. "I know for me it has been a long season, a lot of matches in the end of the year. I'm getting tired. "But it's the last effort, could be the last effort of the year, so I will try to enjoy it and do the best I can." Djokovic, who won in France last weekend and overcame Federer in his opening match in London, was pleased to come through another tough examination. "I have to say, considering the scheduling on back to back Bercy and World Tour Finals, I had luck that my group was selected to play Tuesday, Thursday," said Djokovic. "And I played night matches, so it gave me more time to rest, gave me more time to get ready. "I overcame the two big fights against Roger and against Juan Martin today. Both matches went the distance; both matches were decided in a few points. So I'm just very glad to be able to play my best when it's needed. "I did qualify for semi-finals, which is definitely a positive news, but I still want to try to win the last match of the group." A full house of more than 17,000 spectators packed into the O2 Arena to see a repeat of this year's gripping Wimbledon semi-final, which Djokovic won in five sets. And with Del Potro on a run of 16 wins in 18 matches since the US Open, Thursday's night session pitched the two most in-form men on tour against one another. Both men knew that a straight-sets win would be good enough for a semi-final spot, with any score enough for Djokovic. The world number two, 26, made an error-strewn start, surviving two break points in the opening game, but then began to find his range. After pushing hard for the breakthrough in game four, he grabbed the initiative two games later. Unerring accuracy and depth kept Del Potro constantly on the move and the Argentine eventually flailed at a forehand, before Djokovic rubbed salt in the wound by closing out the set with a second-serve ace. Del Potro, 25, might have spent much of the first set breathlessly chasing from side to side, but some solid serving got him back into the contest early in the second. The Argentine fans in the arena raised the volume another notch when their man finally got the break at 3-2, thanks to a net cord that was too deadly for even Djokovic to run down. Del Potro withstood some pressure on serve to level at one set all after 75 minutes, and the destiny of Group B remained wide open. It was Del Potro who threatened first at 1-1 in the decider but he missed with an attempted forehand pass, and just about held himself back from taking it out on his racquet. The miss proved costly when Djokovic showed a more ruthless streak at 3-2, this time getting the benefit of a net cord on his way to the break, and three straight games took him to the brink of victory. Djokovic played a nerveless final service game that included one sublime drop volley and finished with a clean backhand winner to remain on course for a third season-ending title. </body>

      <body>AP McCoy says he has no immediate plan to retire after riding his 4,000th winner, at Towcester on Thursday. The 18-time champion became the first jump jockey to reach the mark with victory on Mountain Tunes, trained by Jonjo O'Neill and owned by JP McManus. "As a jump jockey you take it day by day," the Northern Irishman, who turns 40 in May, told BBC Sport. "I really love what I do, but it is about winning and you need to keep winning. But age is only a number." McCoy's mark is almost 1,500 more than the next most successful jockey Richard Johnson, who has ridden 2,567 winners. He had his first winner in March 1992 at Thurles on board Legal Steps for Jim Bolger and is on course for his 19th jockeys' title, but will decide in April whether to go for number 20. "At the end of each season I review how I have got on and how I've performed and you make the decision on whether to carry on from that," he said. "I will look back and ask, 'Did I do OK? Should I still be riding? Am I still riding as well as I have done in the past?' Those are the questions I always ask myself at the end of every season." McCoy returns to action on Friday at Southwell, where he will again ride for long-time friends McManus and O'Neill on Forthefunofit in the closing National Hunt Flat race as he chases winner 4,001. "I'm really proud of what I've achieved and being able to last, one way or another. I'm lucky and proud to have done it," he said. "You have to have goals. Otherwise you get a bit lazy. I'm one of those people who needs to chase something. I find it easier because I love what I do, but it keeps me working that bit harder." </body>

      <title>US writer claims Dylan Thomas Prize</title>
      <description>American short story writer Claire Vaye Watkins is named as the winner of the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for new writers.</description>

      <body>American short story writer Claire Vaye Watkins has been named the 2013 winner of the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for new writers. Judges said she was an "exceptional" writer and described her collection Battleborn as "infectious". The California-born 29-year-old was one of seven writers aged under 30 shortlisted for the prize. The prize, based in Thomas's birthplace of Swansea, is one of the largest literary cash awards in the world. "It has been such an honour and a treat to be part of this," Ms Watkins said. "I'm grateful for every single reader I have. "It was not written for New York or London, it was written for people like you and Dylan, and anyone else that's been told their place doesn't matter." Ms Watkins was presented with her prize at a ceremony at the city's National Waterfront Museum. "Claire Vaye Watkins has some of Dylan Thomas's extraordinary skill in the short story form of giving you a perfect vision of a complete world and that's extraordinarily rare," said the chair of this year's judging panel, Hay Festival founder Peter Florence. Singer and broadcaster Cerys Matthews, also on the judging panel, added: "Battleborn just bubbles. She is such a natural writer. "The whole book is so infectious - it leaves you looking forward to what is coming next from this exceptional young author." The collection of short stories in Battleborn examines some of the myths of the American west, from how a man responds to finding a cache of letters and pills on the roadside, to sisters unable to comfort each other following their mother's suicide. "How exciting is it that in the year when Alice Munro is the greatest exponent of the modern short story by winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, that the Dylan Thomas Prize finds another truly remarkable short story writer in Claire Vaye Watkins?" said another judge, Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson. "At aged just 29 years old, she is truly gifted." Cultural historian Peter Stead, chair of the Dylan Thomas Prize, said this year's shortlist was the strongest it had ever had. "We admired all the books and in the adjudication we discussed them all at length. There were several books in contention but our choice of Battleborn was unanimous," he said. The judging panel considered three novels, two poetry collections, and two short story collections. Thursday's prizewinner announcement follows a week of events involving all seven shortlisted writers, known as the DylanED programme. It has seen them visit schools and universities across Wales to give readings and take part in creative writing workshops. Those taking part included the one Welsh writer on the shortlist, Jemma King. She was nominated for the prize for her collection of poems, The Shape of a Forest. </body>

      <title>Director Ramsay sued by producers</title>
      <description>The producers of a Western, starring Natalie Portman, take legal action against Scots director Lynne Ramsay, who quit the movie before filming began.</description>

      <body>The producers of Jane Got A Gun, a Western starring Natalie Portman, have taken legal action against Scots director Lynne Ramsay, who quit the movie a day before shooting. They said Ramsay was paid $750,000 (£466,000) to work on the screenplay and to direct but her last-minute departure delayed production. They also claimed she was drunk and abusive on set. Ramsay was followed off the troubled project by actor Michael Fassbender. Jude Law, who was brought in as a replacement, followed suit as did Bradley Cooper after him. Ewan McGregor was eventually brought in to star with Oscar-winner Portman, with Warrior filmmaker Gavin O'Connor signed on to direct. According to the film's synopsis, Portman plays the wife of an injured outlaw, who is forced to defend her farm from his former gang after they attempt to murder him. The court papers, acquired by the Hollywood Reporter and filed in a federal court in New Mexico - where the film was due to shoot, alleged Ramsay "was repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew and was generally disruptive". The legal action further alleged that Ramsey, who was Bafta-nominated for We Need To Talk About Kevin - starring Tilda Swinton, endangered crew members "when she pointed a prop gun directly at a camera and, in turn, at the camera crew before first taking proper precautions". Portman - who is also one of the film's producers - reportedly showed up for the first day of shooting in March unaware that Ramsay had quit the day before. According to a report in the Hollywood Reporter, the Scottish filmmaker had not been presented with an approved schedule, script or budget days before shooting was set to begin. Earlier this year, Ramsay served on the prize jury at the Cannes Film Festival alongside Stephen Spielberg and Nicole Kidman. </body>

      <title>Pakistanis react with dismay to new Taliban chief</title>
      <description>Ilyas Khan on new Pakistan Taliban chief Mullah Fazlullah</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-24859657</url>
      <date>1383902625</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70984000/jpg/_70984604_d1ahpmqq.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Dejection and dismay has been the reaction of many people in Pakistan to the news that Mullah Fazlullah has been made head of the Pakistani Taliban (TTP). He is seen as a particularly ruthless commander whose men in October 2012 shot teenaged schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai in the head as she was on a bus. The world reacted with horror to the shooting, and her subsequent medical treatment drew international media attention - as has her ceaseless campaigning for the right of girls to have an education in northern Pakistan. But Mullah Fazlullah's notoriety does not stem entirely from this incident. He is still remembered for his atrocities in Swat - for ransacking music shops, carrying out public executions and attempting to enforce his own version of Islamic law in addition to banning girls' education and destroying schools. He was the pioneer of what many in Pakistan and internationally believe to be a senseless campaign against the United Nations-funded polio vaccination drive. His elevation has also taken aback those in official Pakistani circles who had been pushing for a peace dialogue with Taliban. He is well-known to the government. In 2009 it accepted all his conditions and enacted Sharia law in Swat but Mullah Fazlullah still refused to disarm. Many in Pakistan believe that his appointment could trigger divisions within the faction-riddled Taliban. Members of the Mehsud tribe in particular may not be too happy with his elevation. They form the backbone of the Pakistani Taliban and a majority of them were close to the faction led by Waliur Rehman, who was killed in a drone strike in May. Mr Rehman's successor is Khan Said Sajna, and many analysts predict that his fighters at some point may stage a comeback and relegate Mullah Fazlullah to a secondary position. Mullah Fazlullah had to be evicted from Swat by a military operation that caused about three million people to leave their homes and live in refugee camps for several months. His subsequent activities from his base in Afghanistan's north-eastern province of Nuristan have been equally hostile. His group claimed responsibility for a number of deadly attacks against the Pakistani military and the police, including an attack in September that killed a Pakistan army general and a lieutenant-colonel in a roadside bomb attack in the north-western district of Dir, adjacent to Nuristan. The Pakistani government has announced a $5,000 (£3,110) reward for information leading to his death or capture, which is still valid. Despite all these exploits, is he really as big a problem for Pakistan as his two predecessors, Baitullah Mehsud and Hakimullah Mehsud? Sources that understand the tribal dynamics in Pakistan's semi-autonomous Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) believe he is not. For them, he is a leader in exile, with no presence on Pakistani soil and no tribal power in the Waziristan region, which is the main militant sanctuary in the area and where tribal identities run stronger than ideology. His chosen deputy, Sheikh Khalid Haqqani, is an Islamist ideologue who lives in Miranshah, the central town of North Waziristan, but he is equally bereft of local tribal identity as he comes from the Swabi district in the Peshawar valley region. But analysts also say that the real power of the TTP is ultimately going to gravitate to the main Mehsud tribe, the natives of South Waziristan who founded the movement and who still remain its main strength. But the analysts also say that the real power of the TTP is ultimately going to gravitate to the main Mehsud tribe, the natives of South Waziristan who founded the TTP and who still remain its main strength. They say that Mullah Fazlullah and Sheikh Haqqani have been chosen as the top two TTP leaders because the Mehsud tribe suffered an internal rift between the groups led by Hakimullah Mehsud, the TTP chief who was killed in a drone strike last week, and Waliur Rehman. During years of rivalry, the Hakimullah Mehsud group lost most of the ethnic Mehsud fighters to the Waliur Rehman group because it had been too tilted towards the non-Mehsud militant groups based north of Waziristan in the Fata region. For the moment, the Hakimullah Mehsud group seems to have won the leadership battle by preventing the Waliur Rehman group from taking over, but the arrangement is unlikely to endure. For Pakistan, this augurs well, as Khan Said Sajna is believed to be more inclined to do business with the Pakistanis than either the late Hakimullah Mehsud or his northern ally and successor, Mullah Fazlullah. The question is, will the Mehsuds prefer to strike a deal with the Pakistani politicians, who are still struggling to find their feet in a nascent democratic system, or with Pakistan's powerful military establishment which has monopolised the country's foreign and security policy for several decades and raised militant proxies, including elements in the TTP, to fight regional wars on its behalf? A deal with the politicians may still remain elusive. The politicians' motive for regional peace is to promote trade with neighbouring countries such as India and Afghanistan. There is nothing in it for the fighters. By contrast, the military establishment offers fighting opportunities in both the post-Nato Afghanistan and their arch-rival, India, long considered by Pakistan's religious hardliners as a land that needs to be conquered and proselytised. </body>

      <description>The delicate task of removing fuel rods</description>

      <body>Engineers at Japan's Fukushima nuclear plant are preparing to extract the first of thousands of fuel rods from the wrecked reactor-four building. This delicate task is a major step on the long road to making the site safe, reports the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes. If you open an Internet search engine and type in "Fukushima reactor four" you may be forgiven for thinking the world is about to end. There are some pretty scary stories circulating about what is about to happen at the plant. Some predict a disaster that will make Tokyo uninhabitable - others go further. Why? It comes down to what is, in the next few weeks, going to start happening inside one building at the destroyed nuclear plant. There is a very good reason why the outside world is obsessed with the reactor-four building - the enormous amount of radioactive material it contains. On the Internet, measures including three Chernobyls and 14,000 Hiroshimas are used to describe the volume of radioactive material. Suffice to say that it is a lot - nearly 500 tonnes of nuclear fuel, around 100,000 fuel rods. On Thursday I was one of a small number of journalists allowed inside reactor building four for the first time since the disaster. These trips are gruelling. Hours are spent on buses, in waiting rooms, being lectured, all for a few minutes looking in to a dark green pool. So what can I report? Mainly that I feel somewhat reassured by what I have seen. The preparations for the fuel removal appear meticulous. Over the past year a massive new structure has been built over the building to carry the huge cranes that will lift the fuel. The fuel pool has been cleaned - even using an underwater vacuum to remove debris from the 2011 explosions. Looking down into the pool today the water was clear, the fuel assemblies clearly visible. That does not mean there will not be problems. Some of the assemblies could be cracked or damaged. Even if everything goes to plan, it will take at least a year to remove all the fuel. But there is a plan, and according to Japanese and foreign experts I have spoken to, it is achievable. None of them told me they fear an apocalypse. But visiting the plant, it struck me that in our obsession with reactor four we may be missing the real story at Fukushima. I have recently received a new sophisticated radiation monitor sent from London, which has now had its first outing in the field. You can point it at things and it tells you how many "counts per second" of radiation the object is giving off. Inside reactor building four the readings were constantly low - not surprising when you remember that reactor four had no meltdown. The reactor was offline when the tsunami struck. That is not true with reactors one, two and three. As our bus left reactor four and drove along the sea front, I pointed my new monitor out of the window towards reactor building three. Suddenly the needle started to spike - 1,000 counts per second, then 2,000, 3,000, finally it went off the scale. There, outside the bus, just a few dozen meters away is the real dead zone, a place where it is still far too dangerous for anyone to go. No human has been inside reactor three since the disaster. To do so would be suicide. No-one knows when it will be possible to go in. When I asked the same experts how long it would be until reactors one, two and three could be dismantled, they shook their heads. When I asked them where they thought the melted reactor cores were, they shook their heads again. Tokyo Electric Power Company was happy to show us reactor four, but please do not ask what they intend to do with reactors one, two and three. </body>

      <body>Since Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition first conquered the South Pole in 1911 plenty of others have followed in his footsteps - but not necessarily by foot. The journey has been completed with dog sleds, snowmobiles and four-wheel-drives. But no one had ever completed it on a pushbike. That is the challenge Juan Menendez Granados has set for himself. And he plans to do it solo. The Spanish adventurer will have to cross 1,200km (750 miles) of snow and ice, and ascend a total of 3,000 metres, from the Antarctic coast to the South Pole. He plans to set out around 1 December, or a few days before. During the 36 to 38 days the ride should last, he will be constantly exposed to extreme cold, with temperature seldom rising above -20°C. "I have been preparing for this challenge for two and a half years," he tells BBC Mundo. That training has included an expedition in its own right - a 27-day cycle-ride through Greenland in August-September this year. Although he might face less snowfall than he did in Greenland, Antarctica will be colder, and he will have the polar wind pounding him head on. "[I need to avoid] getting my hands too cold to pitch the tent," he says. That would be the tent where he will try to sleep a minimum of eight hours a day, after pedalling for eight to ten hours, hauling an 85kg load with all his supplies. That will consume much more than the 5,000 calories he expects to eat every day. Being alone will bring its own complications. Loneliness will have an emotional impact. But it also means he will have no assistance on hand if he needs to be rescued. In good weather conditions a rescue party would take five hours to reach him, according to Stephen Jones, member of the Royal Geographical Society and manager of Antarctic Logistics and Expeditions, which will support Menendez Granados. "Worst case scenario," says Jones, "he might have to wait a few days for good weather". Jones agrees it is a very difficult enterprise. "He's got a greater risk of mechanical failure [than someone skiing or walking]." But the latest evolution in bicycle design has been key in allowing adventurers to try their luck in Antarctica - Menendez Granados's bike has 12cm (4.7 in) wheels and modified forks. He has decided against using tyres with nails but says the broader tyres should provide the grip he needs. "Several people have tried it over a few years, and none of them got anywhere at all, until last year," says Jones. In January 2012, BBC TV presenter Helen Skelton reached the South Pole. Although she covered a much shorter distance - 800 km - and most of it was done on skis, she did cycle for 165km. And in December 2012 the American Eric Larsen tried his hand on a similar bike to Menendez Granados's (Skelton's had a different design). Larsen proved that "the technology isn't perfect, but is good enough," according to Jones. Nevertheless, Larsen abandoned his attempt after covering 280km. "I had to make the difficult decision to turn around as surface snow conditions prevented me from covering enough miles before [my] food and supplies ran out," he wrote in his blog. Menendez Granados will try to make it all the way to the end. He will not be the only one. The American Daniel Burton will also try to reach the South Pole on a solo trip on two wheels, and is leaving around the same time. And by the end of 2014 the Australian Kate Leeming will attempt the challenge. It looks like a race then. But the Spaniard disagrees: "Antarctica is not a good place for races." Although it is considered a cycling expedition, there will be times when he will have to dismount, put the bike on the sled and pull. "There are bits where you have to walk," says Jones, who adds that Menendez Granados will be carryings skis to use when pedalling becomes impossible, especially on soft snow where walking would also be hard. But if he skis in certain stretches, would he then be able to claim he was the first person to reach the South Pole by bike? "The fact is that I will not be able to change the conditions I will encounter, whatever they are," says the adventurer. "I will try to do as much as possible on the bicycle and in normal conditions it should be considered a bike expedition." Jones believes that it could be claimed that he did it by bike if he spends some 30 days pedalling and the rest on skis. Menendez Granados does not plan to ride back either. "Cycling back would involve carrying extra food [he plans to carry enough for 40 days] and leaving earlier, which would reduce the chances of success almost to zero," he explains. Jones agrees that this strategy will help maximise his chances - though, he points out - a "good chance" in Antarctica is probably only "50-50" in real terms. </body>

      <title>How strong is anti-Semitism in Germany?</title>
      <description>How anti-Semitic is Germany 75 years after Kristallnacht?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24852131</url>

      <body>It's 75 years since the pogroms that became known as Kristallnacht - the night of broken glass. It was the outbreak of mass violence against Jews which was to end in their mass murder. As the anniversary is marked, how strong - or weak - is anti-Semitism in Germany today? Ruth Recknagel remembers the feral looting. Even today, 75 years later, she recalls people swarming around the broken windows of Jewish shops in Berlin and then snatching what they could. Ruth was born in 1930, so on 9 November, 1938 she was only eight years old. She walked around the shattered glass at Potsdamer Platz with her Jewish father. What she witnessed remains imprinted on her mind. "It was a decisive break," she says. "It was the start. From then on, everything got worse." Others remembered the way the pogroms unfolded into an organised orgy of violence. There was unrestrained grabbing from shops as well as attacks on schools and even hospitals. The Daily Telegraph correspondent in Berlin at the time, Michael Bruce, recounted "one of the foulest exhibitions of bestiality" he had ever witnessed when rioters broke into a hospital for sick Jewish children. Tiny children were being chased "over the broken glass, bare-footed and wearing nothing but their nightshirts," Bruce wrote. "The nurses, doctors, and attendants were being kicked and beaten by the mob leaders, most of whom were women." The November pogroms marked the start of the Holocaust. After it, the gloves were truly off. Jews had been persecuted from 1933 - barred from ever more jobs, routinely insulted and attacked. But Kristallnacht was the step-change in escalation. Any pretence and restraint vanished. The shattered glass of Kristallnacht led to the death camps. And that is not forgotten in Germany today. It is taught in schools and remembered from podiums occupied by the chancellor of Germany down. But how much anti-Semitism lingers despite the knowledge of what happened? It is a complex picture. There is, for example, a growing Jewish population in Germany. It is small at less than 1% of the total population (and much smaller than the 5% of the population with a Turkish background, for example). But it is a community which is growing rapidly, and people don't tend to migrate to a more hostile environment than the one they left. The Israeli embassy in Berlin estimates that there are about 10,000 Israelis in Berlin alone, many of them drawn by the cultural life. The city abounds with Israeli sculptors, painters and musicians who often say they have found a home conducive to artistic creation. There is, though, sometimes resentment from other Jews. I've been in a meeting where a visiting American-Jewish author rounded on the Israelis there who had moved to Germany to live and work. How could they look at themselves in the mirror, the angry author taunted the Israeli immigrants to Germany. Every two years, the University of Bielefeld conducts a rigorous study of attitudes in Germany. Its most recent survey suggested that about 20% of the German population had what it called "latent anti-Semitism" - some sort of quiet, unspoken antipathy towards Jews. They tease out attitudes towards minorities by asking a series of indirect questions about blame for the financial crisis, for example, or who has excessive influence. A further 5-10% showed overt anti-Semitism. The study concluded: "The significantly strongest agreement with anti-Semitic prejudices is found in Poland and Hungary. In Portugal, followed closely by Germany, anti-Semitism is significantly more prominent than in the other western European countries. In Italy and France, anti-Semitic attitudes as a whole are less widespread than the European average, while the extent of anti-Semitism is least in Great Britain and the Netherlands." Jews in Germany often say, though, that they find much more anti-Semitism when they go abroad. One person told the BBC she had experienced far worse prejudice in Britain than she had at home in Germany - in a Cambridge college, ham was sometimes placed in her postbox. Rabbis often praise the German government for its outspoken condemnation of anti-Semitism. "Germany is certainly doing a lot to fight anti-Semitism," says Prof Walter Homolka, the director of Abraham Geiger College at the University of Potsdam. "Whether it is ever going to be enough, that's a big question. We can only hope to keep this figure of 20% in check." He says the public statements and the presence of people from Chancellor Angela Merkel down at big Jewish events is important as a signal to the rest of the population. Chancellor Merkel has said that an attack on Jews is an attack on everyone. And responding to a young Jewish student who had pointed out that Jewish institutions in Germany still need police protection, she said recently that the people of Germany needed "civil courage". What does seem to be clear is that anti-Semitism is rising in Germany. "Anti-Semitism is acceptable again," says the foundation's director, Anetta Kahane from the Amadeu Antonio Foundation which campaigns against racism. "It must be said clearly - those who say something anti-Semitic tacitly legitimise physical attacks on Jews." The foundation has collated official figures which say that in 2011, there were 811 attacks on Jews. These were of various degrees of intimidation, from verbal attacks to physical assault, and included 16 violent attacks. In 2012, that rose to 865 attacks in total, with 27 of them being violent. In the first half of this year, the rise seems to have continued, with 409 attacks, 16 of them violent. A year ago, Rabbi Daniel Alter was attacked by a group of youths of Middle Eastern appearance as he walked with his young daughter. "They made threats of violence against female members of my family, including my seven-year-old daughter who was by my side," he says. One man confronted him very aggressively before striking him: "With his first hit he broke my cheek bone. There was another man hitting me from behind, hitting me either with his fist or something else on my head, and I fell to the floor. The next thing is I saw them running away." It has made him change his life. Seventy five years after Kristallnacht, he feels he can no longer wear his skullcap openly in some areas of Berlin, and covers it with a hat. And he has re-doubled his efforts to visit schools and talk to children - often alongside an Imam from a mosque. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Would you visit a fake tourist attraction?</title>
      <description>Which would you rather visit - a fake tomb or a real one?</description>

      <body>A replica of King Tutankhamun's tomb is about to open in Egypt, and the authorities are hoping tourists will choose to visit this copy instead of the original. It's not the first time such steps have been taken to protect a historical site - and some reproductions are very popular. Tutankhamun's tomb lay untouched for more than 3,000 years until the British archaeologist, Howard Carter, uncovered it in 1922. It was virtually intact - the best preserved tomb found in the Valley of the Kings. Fast forward to 2013 and the state of the tomb is causing deep concern. Although Egypt's political unrest has reduced the flow of tourists, there have been times when more than 1,000 people a day have traipsed through it. As people enter, temperature and humidity levels change, making the walls expand and contract. As a result, the elaborately decorated plaster is coming away from the rock face. This is where artistic and preservation specialists, Factum Arte, the Factum Foundation for Digital Technology in Conservation and the Society for the Friends of the Royal Tombs of Egypt come in. In 2009, they spent five weeks recording every detail of the tomb, measuring 100 million points in every square metre. They used the data to recreate the tomb, and this month they will erect their replica next to Carter's house, about 1km (0.6 miles) from the real burial site. The copy is identical to the original "to around a tenth of a millimetre", says Adam Lowe from Factum Arte. Although the real tomb may eventually need to be closed to the public to preserve it, for now visitors will have a choice - real or fake. Which one will they choose? Lowe believes people will generally want to "become part of the force that protects it rather than a force that is leading to its destruction". But is it more exciting to see the original? "They will have the thrill of visiting something they know is 3,000 years old and they have the guilt of knowing, as they look at it, that their presence is part of the reason why it won't be there in another 100 years' time," says Lowe. The case of the Lascaux cave in south-west France suggests replicas can in fact prove even more popular than the original. In 1940, four boys discovered the cave, whose walls are decorated with some of the most important prehistoric art ever found. The 17,000-year-old artworks were in perfect condition because the cave had effectively been sealed off for thousands of years. But things changed after it was opened to the public in 1948. Mould, blackish film, green stains and calcite formed on the walls. So in the early 1960s, when it was receiving 100,000 visitors a year, the Lascaux cave was closed. But tourists still wanted to see the images, so Lascaux II was created. This is a replica of most of the cave. It was opened in 1983 just 200m from the prehistoric site, and over the years has attracted 10 million visitors. It is so popular that a mobile Lascaux III is now touring the world, and work on Lascaux IV - a reconstruction of the whole cave system - will start next year. But for author and historian Tom Holland, a copy is still a copy. "In our society there is a huge premium set on authenticity," he says. "Clearly, were there not a difference between the original and a copy, it wouldn't matter - you could make a replica and trash the original". For him, although preservation is important, there is something unique about places like Tutankhamun's tomb and the Lascaux caves - a "quality of holiness". "Both were constructed by people who believed in the world of the spirits, the dead and the supernatural," he says. "You don't have to believe in a god or gods to feel a place is consecrated and has a particular quality that cannot be reproduced." In Italy, the importance of seeing an artwork in its original home is also being emphasised - but this time by the owners of a copy. Paolo Veronese finished his painting, The Wedding at Cana, in 1563. It was commissioned for the refectory in the Benedictine monastery of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, and that is where it hung for more than 200 years. In 1797, Napoleon's invading army ripped it down, cut it up and took it to Paris. Today the painting is still in France and on display at the Louvre. A copy of Veronese's work now hangs in the refectory in Venice, leaving tourists with an interesting question - is it better to see the original in the wrong setting or a copy in the right setting? "The one in the Louvre is clearly more original, but seeing the facsimile at the right height, without a frame, in the place which it was designed for is a more authentic experience," says Lowe. The copy was commissioned from Factum Arte by the Giorgio Cini Foundation, the caretaker of the Benedictine monastery. "I would never exchange the facsimile for the original," says the organisation's secretary general Pasquale Gagliardi. "I would be obliged to transform the refectory from a living and lived in space into a museum, with the artificial, cold, uniform light of the museums." What's more, he says, the copy has been painted with pigments that won't alter so much over time. "In 20 years, when the original at the Louvre needs a new restoration, they will have to come here to see the original colours." Answer: The picture on the right is the original tomb, the one on the left is the replica. Adam Lowe spoke to Newshour on the BBC World Service.

      <title>NHS spends £700 insuring each birth</title>
      <description>The NHS spends nearly £700 on clinical negligence cover for every live birth in England, a report says.</description>

      <body>The NHS spends nearly £700 on clinical negligence cover for every live birth in England, a report says. The review by the National Audit Office said last year this cost nearly £500m - almost a fifth of all spending on maternity. Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge said the figure was "absolutely scandalous". The Department of Health said the NHS is one of the safest places in the world to have a baby. Having a baby is the most common reason for admission to hospital in England. The number of births has increased by almost a quarter in the last decade, reaching nearly 700,000 live births. The public spending watchdog said maternity services were generally good for women and babies, but there was still a lot of scope for improvement. Its report highlighted "wide unexplained variations" between trusts in rates of complications such as readmissions, injuries and infections. Laura Blackwell, director of health value for money studies at the National Audit Office, told the BBC the number of maternity claims had risen significantly in recent years. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: "There has been an increase in claims and we don't cover exactly why. It is the same across the NHS. "I think it's a complicated picture... further complicated by the fact it takes an average of four years for a claim to be settled... so it's quite hard to draw conclusions about the current state of care." The NAO also pointed to a shortage of midwives and consultants on labour wards. The report concluded that a further 2,300 midwives are required, though their distribution across England varies substantially. And although it said the level of consultant presence has improved, more than half of units are not meeting the standard recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The report noted that between April and September last year more than a quarter of maternity units were closed to admissions for at least half a day because demand outstripped capacity. Clinical negligence claims for maternity have risen by 80% in the last five years. The cost of cover last year was £482m, and the average payment per claim was £277,000. Figures from the NHS Litigation Authority released last year showed the health service in England paid out more than £3bn in compensation claims linked to maternity care between 2000 and 2010. Ms Hodge said: "I find it absolutely scandalous that one fifth of all funding for maternity services, equivalent to around £700 per birth, is spent on clinical negligence cover." She said the NAO report had shown an urgent need to improve maternity services. "The department needs to buck up and take responsibility for this. It needs to review its monitoring and reporting process to ensure that all relevant bodies can work effectively together to deliver maternity services that are value for money and fit for purpose." James (not his real name), a recipient of medical negligence money, told the Today programme the money had helped give his son a better quality of life. He and his wife did not claim for negligence until six months after the birth of their son, when they realised the costs involved in his care. Their son had been starved of oxygen during birth and now suffers from quadriplegic cerebral palsy, severe brain damage, visual impairment and epilepsy. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said the health service should always learn from any mistakes to improve patient care in the future. "The NHS remains one of the safest places in the world to have a baby, but on rare occasions care falls below acceptable standards and unsafe care should never be tolerated." He said the service was making progress. "This report shows that most women have good outcomes and positive experiences of maternity care. We know 84% of women now say they have good care, which has gone up from 75% six years ago. But we are determined to improve further." Royal College of Midwives chief executive Cathy Warwick said the report backed up what the college had been saying for a long time. "We are many thousands of midwives short of the number needed to deliver safe, high quality care. Births are at a 40-year high and other figures out this week show that this is set to continue. As the report states, births are also becoming increasingly complex putting even more demands on midwives and maternity services." Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Dr David Richmond said the NAO report raised valid concerns. "Although the UK is generally a safe place for women to give birth, we have known for some time that pressure on maternity services is growing in some areas, particularly inner city conurbations, placing stress on clinicians, managers and patients alike." </body>

      <body>Nissan will reconsider its investment in the UK if Britain leaves the European Union, chief executive Carlos Ghosn has told the BBC. He was speaking in Sunderland, where Nissan employs 6,500 workers. Prime Minister David Cameron has promised a public vote on EU membership in 2017 if the Conservatives win the next general election in 2015. But Mr Ghosn also added that he considered the exit scenario to be unlikely. When asked how Nissan would react if the UK were to leave the EU, Mr Ghosn said: "If anything has to change, we [would] need to reconsider our strategy and our investments for the future." Mr Ghosn was visiting Sunderland for the launch of the company's new Qashqai model, which will be built there. Praising the Sunderland plant, Mr Ghosn said it was one of the most productive in Europe and said Nissan was "blessed" to own it. With sales of more than 240,000 last year, the Qashqai is Nissan's best-selling car in Europe. The car accounts for more than half the output of the Sunderland plant and Mr Ghosn says the new model "ensures" a lot of jobs in the city. Mr Ghosn, who is also chief executive of Nissan's sister company Renault, says that after five years of decline the European car market is arriving at "the end of the tunnel". He says that next year the European market should be stable with possibly a little growth. Action by the European Central Bank, including Thursday's cut in interest rates, could help that recovery according to Mr Ghosn. </body>

      <title>MPs attack immigration removal rate</title>
      <description>MPs call for "effective action" against illegal immigration, saying only 1.5% of allegations result in a person being removed from the UK.</description>

      <body>Only 1.5% of reports alleging illegal immigration result in a person being removed from the UK, MPs have said. The Home Affairs Committee also said the now-defunct UK Border Agency had a backlog of 432,029 immigration and asylum cases when it was scrapped at the end of March. Its chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, urged the coalition to take "effective action" to amend a "poor record". The government responded that it was "getting tough" on illegal immigration. The committee looked at the allegations database set up by the UKBA to follow up tip-offs by the public. It replaced a system where allegations and removals were held separately. It revealed that about 6% of claims had led to an investigation and 1.5% had resulted in removals. The committee said it was "extremely concerned about the number of allegations that are made to the Allegations Management System that are not investigated. "We recommend that all allegations are actioned and checked against national databases. It is incomprehensible that only 1.5 in 100 reports of illegal immigration result in someone being removed from the country." Mr Vaz said there was a "very poor record" on removals, which did "not give confidence to those who go out of their way to help the Home Office". The committee's report revealed that between its introduction on 30 September last year and 30 June this year, the database had received 48,660 allegations - about 178 a day. It said the rates of investigation and removal risked undermining confidence in the system and "could lead to reluctance to report such allegations if the public perceive that no action is being taken". The MPs recommended that those who made allegations of illegal immigration be told the outcome of investigations, in an effort to improve public confidence. After a series of damning reports, Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UKBA and replaced it with UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which were brought back under the control of ministers. "There are still over 430,000 cases languishing in the backlogs, enough to fill Wembley Stadium almost five times over," Mr Vaz went on. "As we have said on numerous occasions, the backlogs must be cleared as a matter of priority. Only then will the Home Office be able to tackle the deeper problems in the immigration system." Immigration minister Mark Harper said: "The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since its formation in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. That is why we split the agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates." He added: "Our newly created UK Visa and Immigration directorate is focused on delivering a high-volume, high-quality visa service, while Immigration Enforcement is getting tough on those who break our immigration laws." Mr Harper also said: "We are building an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010." But Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said the committee's "damning report" shows that "for all the rhetoric Theresa May's Home Office is failing badly in tackling illegal immigration, backlogs of cases, and can only show progress by sleight of hand. "This out of touch government's response to real challenges has been to use taxpayers' money on ineffective and offensive gimmicks like the ad vans and 'go home' texts." He added: "The home secretary urgently needs to get a grip on the shambolic performance of the Home Office and make sure people are removed when they shouldn't be here, and sort out the backlogs that are increasing on her watch." Under plans announced by the Home office last month, landlords would be asked to check the immigration status of their tenants. There would also be new powers to check driving licence applicants' immigration status and a reduction in the number of grounds for appeal against deportation decisions from 17 to four. </body>

      <title>Npower boss rejects bonus 'gimmicks'</title>
      <description>Amid controversy over rising energy prices, Npower chief executive Paul Massara dismisses forfeiting his bonus as a "gimmick".</description>

      <body>The chief executive of Npower, Paul Massara, has dismissed giving up a bonus in response to anger over rising energy prices as a "gimmick". In an interview with the BBC's Hardtalk, Mr Massara also warned of future power cuts unless there is a "stable environment" for investment. He said he earned around £600,000 a year, which includes a £150,000 bonus. On Monday Centrica boss Sam Laidlaw pledged to decline a bonus this year to help restore trust in energy companies. When asked whether he would match Mr Laidlaw's pledge, Mr Massara said: "I think the issue is, are we doing absolutely everything we can to keep costs down and to make sure it's affordable? "Gimmicks of saying 'I'm going to reduce my bonus' - If Sam was earning five million a year and he's willing to give a million, good for him. "My bonus is linked to my performance, is linked to getting it right for customers, is linked to employee satisfaction. All of my team are linked to that. If we don't deliver on that, we don't get a bonus." He said he thought the lights would stay on this year, but warned: "The amount of spare capacity to meet the peak requirement... has dropped from somewhere around 15% to five. "That is extremely low by historical levels... and unless the UK can create a politically stable environment to attract new capital, that new capital will not come in." On Monday Mr Laidlaw said the energy sector needed to urgently rebuild consumers' trust and to help do that he would not take a bonus this year. "Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it," he said. Recent increases of around 9% have caused anger and last month the Commons Energy and Climate Change Committee summoned energy bosses to explain the steep rise in prices. In September Labour leader Ed Miliband promised to to freeze energy bills for 20 months if he is successful in the 2015 election. Energy companies complain that government policy is to blame for higher energy prices in particular "green" fees which are added to bills. Currently 6% of a gas bill and 11% of an electricity bill go to government schemes aimed at saving energy, reducing emissions and tackling climate change. Mr Massara told Hardtalk: "The more the government creates uncertainty with things like price freezes or other changes, it means there's less certainty and less likely for capital investment." </body>

      <body>A service is to take place later near Royal Wootton Bassett to remember over 400 members of the UK armed forces who have died in Afghanistan since 2001. It will be held at the Royal British Legion's Field of Remembrance, at Lydiard Park, Wiltshire. Over 40,000 crosses bearing personal remembrance messages are to be planted in Lydiard Park's walled garden. Meanwhile, the Guards Museum is trying to raise £140,000 to bring back soil from 70 World War One battlefields. The soil will be interred in a memorial garden at London's Wellington Barracks. Among those expected to attend the remembrance service at Lydiard Park is Emma Hickman, the fiancee of Pte Daniel Wade, who was killed in action in Afghanistan in March 2012. Pte Wade, 20, from Cheshire, who served with 3rd Battalion The Yorkshire Regiment, died along with five colleagues when their Warrior armoured personnel carrier was destroyed by a bomb. Royal British Legion National Vice Chairman Terry Whittles said the service would show "support and admiration" for those who have paid the "ultimate sacrifice". "We will never forget them," he said. "I would encourage all members of the public to visit the Field of Remembrance and pay their respects in this very special place." In addition to the ceremony, 30,000 poppies are being planted - each bearing a special tribute from Legion supporters to all those lost in service. The park will be open to the public until November 17. The Guards Museum has described the move to return "sacred soil" from some of the most famous battlefields in Belgium as a "historic world-first project". The Commonwealth War Grave Commission have allowed the soil to be excavated for the first time, from sites widely regarded as having seen some of the Great War's most tragic episodes of conflict. More than 1,000 British and Belgian schoolchildren were involved in collecting 70 bags of soil from the battlefields this summer. The soil will arrive in London on 29 November aboard Belgian Naval Frigate the Louise Marie - which will sail under Tower Bridge and berth alongside HMS Belfast. The following day, the soil will be moved to a new memorial garden at the Guards Museum, in Wellington Barracks, near Buckingham Palace. The £700,000 project will be funded jointly by The Guards Museum, public donations and corporate sponsors - including a contribution from the Government of Flanders. But the Guards Museum says there is still a £280,000 funding shortfall - including £140,000 to bring back the bags of soil, costing £2,000 per bag. Andrew Wallis, Curator of The Guards Museum, added that the garden would stand as a "tangible demonstration of the bond between Britain and Belgium". </body>

      <title>Call to ban under-18s from Army</title>
      <description>The British Army should stop recruiting under 18-year-olds, campaigners say.</description>

      <body>The British Army should stop recruiting under 18-year-olds, campaigners and religious figures have urged. An open letter from human rights group Child Soldiers International called on the Ministry of Defence to raise the joining age from the current 16. All Church in Wales bishops signed the letter, along with other Christian peace groups from around the UK. The MoD said it had no plans to change the recruitment age, arguing enlisting could be beneficial for youngsters. At present, 16-year-olds can join the Army with parental consent and can apply from 15 and 7 months. "We commend the MoD for having ceased routinely deploying children into conflict, but challenge its failure to stop recruiting them," the letter said. It was signed by the Archbishop of Wales Dr Barry Morgan, the Reverend Sally Foster-Fulton, convenor of the Church and Society Council of the Church of Scotland, and peace groups run by Baptists, Methodists, Roman Catholics and Quakers. The campaigners pointed out that in World War One, the youngest that recruits could join up was officially 18 - and that only those older than 19 were supposed to be sent to fight, "although it was known that many younger boys slipped through". Dave, who joined the army at 16, told the BBC he thought recruits should be "at least 20". "You've got two years training before you go into a theatre of war," he said. "But still, you're still a child. "At 18 you're going through massive life changes and still experiencing." He added that joining at the age of at least 20 would ensure "you've had a little bit of life experience". Peter Felstead, the editor of Jane's Defence Weekly - a magazine reporting on the military - said the UK was out of sync with other European nations. "It is an amazing opportunity to join the British Army for a lot of these guys who, otherwise, simply would not have that kind of opportunity to learn a trade, see the world and really make something of their lives," he said. "But if you do look at the rest of Western Europe, 16 probably does seem slightly early. The average is more like 17 or 18 to join the armed forces." An analysis of MoD figures by Child Soldiers International suggested 880 16-year-olds enlisted last year - 40% fewer than the year before and down from 3,600 a decade ago. The group also claimed that of all the 16-year-olds recruited by the Army last year, nearly half (410) dropped out during training - although the MoD said "only a proportion" would have joined and dropped out in the same year. The charity's director Richard Clarke said: "It's time for the MoD to recognise what more and more young people and their parents are realising - that enlisting at 16 is not in their best interests. "Army training does not give young people what they need to succeed in today's economy, especially in terms of qualifications." But that claim was directly contradicted by the MoD, which said the letter "ignores the benefits and opportunities that a military career offers young people. "It provides them challenging and constructive education, training and employment, equipping them with valuable and transferable skills for life," a spokesman said. "There are currently no plans to revisit the government's recruitment policy for under-18s which is fully compliant with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child." The UK is among fewer than 20 countries which have a minimum voluntary recruitment age of 16. </body>

      <description>Scotland's deputy first minister and finance secretary are meeting BAE directors and union officials at the Scotstoun shipyard on the Clyde.</description>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister and finance secretary are meeting directors and union representatives at the Scotstoun shipyard. It follows an announcement of a major restructuring by BAE, which runs Scotstoun and the nearby Govan yard. About 800 jobs will be lost in Scotland while 940 jobs will go at Portsmouth, where shipbuilding will end. A protest rally will be held in Portsmouth on Saturday followed by a march through the city a week later. Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Finance Secretary John Swinney are meeting BAE Systems directors and union representatives during their visit on Friday morning. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael visited the Govan shipyard on Thursday. Shipbuilding is to end completely at BAE's yard at Portsmouth, while the two Clyde yards have been earmarked for building the Royal Navy's new Type 26 warships. UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the designs for the new ships would not be finalised until the end of next year, which would be after the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September. Mr Carmichael has previously argued Scotland would find it "difficult" to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country votes for independence. But the Scottish government has dismissed suggestions that a "Yes" vote would put future shipyard orders in doubt and said joint procurement of Type 26 vessels could be possible, with Ms Sturgeon accusing her political rivals of trying to "blackmail" Scots into voting "No" in next year's independence referendum. In Portsmouth, a meeting was held between Portsmouth Trades Council, BAE workers and union representatives on Thursday. A statement from the trades council said: "The loss of 940 skilled shipbuilding jobs in Portsmouth will be a disaster. It is not just the workers and their families who will suffer. The knock-on effects for the local economy will be huge and will trigger even more job losses. "We should not follow the lead of local politicians who argue to cut jobs in Scotland to save jobs in Portsmouth. "We should fight to save all shipbuilding jobs, wherever they are. BAE and the government can be put under pressure to keep the shipyard jobs, if there is a concerted campaign." </body>

      <title>Terror suspect suing over 'torture'</title>
      <description>A terror suspect who changed into a burka to escape surveillance is suing the government over allegations of torture abroad, it emerges.</description>

      <body>A terror suspect who changed into a burka to escape surveillance is suing the government over allegations of torture abroad, it has emerged. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, who was subject to an order which restricted his movements, left a London mosque in disguise on Friday. Police were alerted when the tag was tampered with but Mr Mohamed fled. It has now been revealed that Mr Mohamed is seeking compensation at the High Court. Mr Mohamed, a British citizen, claims the UK authorities were complicit in his torture in Somalia, East Africa, in 2011. He travelled to Somalia in 2007 and was detained there with another man - a fellow British citizen known only as CF - in January 2011 until their removal back to the UK in March of that year. Both men allege that they were tortured during their detention and that UK authorities were complicit in their ill-treatment. Mr Justice Irwin, sitting at London's High Court on Thursday, handed down an interim ruling in the action Mr Mohamed is bringing for compensation - the first ruling on the use of the Justice and Security Act 2013 in a civil claim for damages. His human rights claim is against the Foreign Office, Home Office, Ministry of Defence and the Attorney General. It was initially anonymous, but that has been lifted following his disappearance. In a statement, the Foreign Office said it welcomed the High Court ruling, saying its application had been successful. "As this is an ongoing litigation we are unable to comment on the details of the case," it added. Mr Mohamed is believed to have close links to al-Shabab, the Somali insurgent group that raided Nairobi's Westgate shopping mall in September, resulting in 67 deaths, but officials said there was not enough evidence to bring a criminal case against him in court. He has been under a terrorism prevention and investigation measures order (TPim) for almost two years. TPims restrict the movements of people thought to pose a risk to the public, but who cannot be tried for reasons of national security and who cannot be deported. Concerns have also been raised that Mr Mohamed may have a second passport after confusion emerged over his British one. Home Secretary Theresa May told MPs on Monday that officers had seized the 27-year-old's British passport, but has since revealed that this was wrong. Correcting a comment saying the police had Mr Mohamed's passport on Monday, Mrs May asked for the parliamentary record to be corrected to say: "I do not have his passport. Mohamed was not in possession of his British passport when he returned to the UK so there was no passport for the police to seize." The Press Association reported that Mr Mohamed's British passport had been cancelled before his return to the UK. The Home Office would not confirm when it was cancelled. The chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, Keith Vaz, said he was "amazed" by Mrs May's incorrect statement. He said when there were only eight people on TPims in the UK and the government ought to know every detail about them. "It could well be that Mohamed has another passport and her answer has raised questions about his current whereabouts. We will be raising these questions with Charles Farr (director general of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism) when he comes before the committee next Tuesday," she said. The BBC's Security Correspondent Frank Gardner said Mr Mohamed was likely to be under MI5 surveillance when he went on the run after entering the An-Noor Masjid and Community Centre, in west London, on Friday. When he cut off the tag, imposed under the terms of the TPim, it issued a "tamper-alert" to its makers, private security firm G4S. They rang the suspect and contacted the Home Office after he failed to answer. Police were alerted but he had disappeared by the time they arrived. Mr Mohamed's restrictive surveillance regime, which included a 21:30 GMT curfew, was due to expire by January. He is now the subject of a police-led manhunt and could face up to five years in prison if caught. The Met Police's Counter Terrorism Command, MI5 and the UK's Border Force have joined forces to find him. He is the second terror suspect under a TPim order to go missing. Ibrahim Magag, 28, also of Somali origin, was last seen in Camden on Boxing Day last year. When asked if Mr Magag had been found, the Home Office said: "We wouldn't comment on ongoing police investigations." As of September, nine men - eight of them British - were under TPim surveillance. </body>

      <body>Olympic athlete Andy Turner has been left "devastated" after his home was burgled during his mother's funeral. The sprint hurdler appealed for help on Twitter in finding those responsible for the break-in, which happened on Thursday in Hucknall, Nottingham. He tweeted: "Whilst at the function, we were burgled and everything was stolen including my car, laptop, phone plus loads of other stuff." Turner's 58-year-old mother, Yvonne, died on 29 October. In another tweet, Turner, 33, said he was "absolutely devastated". "Can't believe these people could do this on a day like today, please help catch them," he added. Speaking on BBC Radio Nottingham earlier, Mr Turner said he did not regret publicising his mother's funeral on social networking sites. He said: "My mum would have wanted people at the funeral so we put it out there on Facebook and Twitter. "At no point did I say I'd be at my parent's house. "It's absolutely horrific that it's happened during my mum's funeral. "It's mainly my stuff that's gone and that's why I think I was targeted." The hurdler said his white Range Rover Sport, with the number plate L10 RUN and his name below, was taken as well as a personalised bag. The Nottingham-born athlete is the third fastest British sprint hurdler of all time behind Colin Jackson and Tony Jarrett, and won gold medals at both the Commonwealth Games and European Athletics Championships in 2010. He also took bronze in the 110 metres hurdles at the 2011 World Championships in Daegu. </body>

      <title>Afghan 'execution' audio released</title>
      <description>The audio of a conversation between three Royal Marines as they allegedly murdered a captured Afghan insurgent is released by a judge.</description>

      <body>A recording of a conversation between three Royal Marines as they allegedly murdered a captured Afghan insurgent has been released by a judge. In the clip, recorded on one marine's helmet-mounted camera, a gunshot is heard, then groans from the insurgent. The prosecution at the court martial says the shooting was in effect an execution. The trio, Marines A, B and C, deny murdering the man while on duty in Helmand province in 2011. Marine A is accused of shooting the man, while Marines B and C are said to have been "party to the killing". Warning: the transcript of the exchange below contains strong language. Judge Jeff Blackett, judge advocate general, had ruled that the video capturing the incident should not be released because it could be used as propaganda by terrorists. But he ruled that the audio could be published as the panel retired to consider the case after two weeks of evidence. The six minutes and 24 seconds of footage shows the Royal Marine patrol waiting outside a field of tall crops, with an Apache helicopter audible overhead. They can be heard swearing and complaining about their task of carrying out a "damage assessment" after the helicopter attack. The court martial heard the insurgent had been shot at with 139 30mm anti-tank rounds but was still alive - albeit seriously injured - when discovered by the patrol. Marines A and C are seen scouting out the field and locating the Afghan before calling the others over. As Marine B walks towards them, the camera captures its first shot of the insurgent - lying on the ground, covered in blood. The patrol drags the man across the field and into a wooded area nearby. The film shown to the court shows Marine A shooting the Afghan prisoner with a 9mm pistol at close range before saying: "There you are. Shuffle off this mortal coil... It's nothing you wouldn't do to us." Prosecutors allege he then turned to his comrades and said: "Obviously this doesn't go anywhere, fellas. I just broke the Geneva Convention." The transcript of the recording includes: "Do you want him back in?" "I want him back in here so I can see what I'm fucking doing." [Movement] "Err, anybody want to do first aid on this idiot?" "No" "Nope." "Could put one in his head if you want? Take your pick." [Laughter] "Not in his head because that will be fucking obvious." Marine A told the court martial in Bulford, Wiltshire, that he believed the man was already dead when he fired the shot. The court heard the incident occurred after a patrol base came under attack from small arms fire from two insurgents. The case has been adjourned until Friday. </body>

      <title>11-plus coaching culture 'must end'</title>
      <description>An educational charity says the culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must end so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools.</description>

      <body>The culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must be ended so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools, an educational charity says. The Sutton Trust says grammar school entrance tests should also be changed regularly so they are tutor-proof. It urges grammar schools to offer test preparation classes to all candidates, so there is a "more level playing field" between rich and poor pupils. The government gives extra money to schools with disadvantaged pupils. The report, Poor Grammar: Entry into Grammar Schools for Disadvantaged Pupils in England, says pupils from very low income families are outnumbered by four to one in grammar schools by children from fee-paying prep schools. It found only 2.7% of grammar school entrants were from families who qualified for free school meals, while 12.7% came from outside England's state sector - mainly independent schools. Overall in England about 20% of pupils are on free school meals. It is well known that many children from affluent homes are coached for entrance tests, with private tutors offering expensive coaching services particularly in areas where grammar schools are high achieving but few in number. The report also suggested that many parents were using the private preparatory school route to get their children through grammar school doors. Those on lower incomes are less likely to be able to afford to pay for tutoring or private education. Grammars that stand alone, rather than in a wholly selective authority such as Buckinghamshire or Kent, draw pupils from a wide geographical area. This is also true of London grammars which have wide catchment areas, with sometimes 10 or 11 candidates for every place. The competition for places is very intense and not just based on passing the 11-plus but getting the highest marks. The report called for these high achieving schools to increase outreach work "significantly". This could mean such schools encouraging low and middle income households to apply and doing more to dispel the the view that some parents may have of them as "elitist", it said. It even suggests giving priority to poor, bright pupils who meet certain entrance requirements and are eligible for the pupil premium because their families have been in receipt of certain benefits in the previous few years. And once tests are reformed, it suggests children should be provided with at least 10 hours free, or subsidised preparation for entrance tests, so applicants from all backgrounds are given an even chance of success. Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: "Politicians of all parties have accepted that grammar schools are here to stay, and while their numbers are not growing, the number of pupils admitted to them has risen by a quarter, or 30,000, since 1997 and is likely to continue to grow in the years ahead. "Some grammar schools are working to improve access, and grammar schools in Northern Ireland have a far better record than English grammar schools." In his foreword to the report, he said: "The challenge to the sector and for those areas where a selective system prevails is how to ensure that those grammar schools are open to all, and are not simply a preserve of better-off families who can afford private tutors or prep schools fees." He added: "We need fairer tests and there should be a minimum of 10 hours free or subsidised test preparation for all applicants to provide a more level playing field." But National Grammar Schools Association chairman Robert McCartney said the fact that three-quarters of England had no grammar school meant that it was not fair to compare national figures on pupils on free school meals. He added that the report makes clear that grammar schools are a good thing and they are not going to go away. "Clearly since 1997 there have been an additional 300,000 pupils at the 164 grammar schools in England. That really means something like an extra 30 grammar schools with pupils of 1,000 each." He welcomed the idea that grammar schools provide test preparation classes to all pupils, but said it was impossible to design a written test that was not amenable to coaching. However, he agreed that many pupils found their way into grammar schools because they had been heavily coached for the tests. He added: "Grammar school heads report that many pupils have been totally over-coached and begin to struggle further up the school." He said the reason that this coaching industry had come about was because of the "paucity of grammar school places in England". The Department for Education did not wish to comment on the report. </body>

      <title>Anger as orphanage abuse case ended</title>
      <description>Ex-residents of a Catholic orphanage who claim they suffered physical and sexual abuse are angered by a police decision to close the investigation.</description>

      <body>Former residents of a Catholic orphanage who claim they suffered physical and sexual abuse have expressed anger at a police decision to end an inquiry into the allegations. In May Bedfordshire Police said it had started an investigation into abuse at the St Francis Boys Home in Shefford in the 1950s and 1960s. Police said they had ended the inquiry as there was no-one alive to prosecute. Ex-resident Tony Walsh said he was "disgusted" at the development. The BBC has talked to former residents of the home who allege they were physically and/or sexually abused at the orphanage, run by the Catholic diocese of Northampton. In a letter to the complainants, Bedfordshire Police said officers had taken statements from 28 victims and identified a number of new suspects. Police said the suspects included one priest (believed to be Father John Ryan, who ran the home in the 1960s) and four nuns, who "were found to have died", and two other suspects who cannot be located. The police letter states that "as those suspects traced have died the investigation cannot be taken any further as there are no living people to prosecute". The letter adds: "The case will now be closed and only reopened if living suspects are traced." It also reveals that files relating to previous investigations into abuse at the home in 2002-2003, which police said in October were "presumed destroyed", had now been located. Gordon McIntosh, a spokesman for ex-residents who says he was physically abused at the home, said: "I am saddened by the decision to close the case. "How can they close it when they haven't located all the suspects?" He said ex-residents were still coming forward and closing the case seemed "premature". Mr McIntosh, of Roehampton, south-west London, said former residents would be continuing their fight for justice and a group was bringing a civil case against the Catholic Church. Tony Walsh, 65, of Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester, who alleges he was sexually abused by Fr Ryan and has waived his right to anonymity, said: "I can't believe they are dropping the case. It's disgusting." He called for an independent inquiry into the case. Bedfordshire Police said any new complaints would be investigated. A force spokeswoman said: "Officers from the Safeguarding Unit have fully investigated each one and all offenders that could be identified and traced are now dead. "Much like Operation Yewtree, the Savile inquiry, complainants have now felt able to contact the police where they had not done before. "Unfortunately, as with Yewtree, the historical nature of the events means that there can be no criminal prosecution." Northamptonshire Diocese of the Catholic Church, which ran the home, has said it "deeply regrets" any hurt caused, but stresses the "claims are not proven". </body>

      <body>Drinking glasses that were a gift from Hollywood legend Humphrey Bogart have sold for more than double their expected price. Bogart gave public relations man Bill Rowland Hill the six small and five large glasses for his help publicising the 1951 film The African Queen. They were sold for £8,000 to a private buyer from Europe at an art and antiques fair in London. It had been expected that they would sell for about £3,500. The glasses, which were engraved with the initials HB, were accompanied by a letter on 20th Century Fox-headed notepaper from Pinewood signed "Bogie". He thanks Mr Rowland Hill for his PR work and "all the other little things". The letter reads: "My Dear Bill. Before I leave for home I want to say, one big 'thank you' from the bottom of my heart for all you have done publicity wise both on the set, and in Africa. "I wanted to send you some Hootch but on second thoughts I want you to have something to put it in. "Will you call at that fancy store (Heal's) on Tottenham Court Street and see a guy called Gaylard. Choose yourself a dozen glasses from the suite I have had made. "Once again sport, thanks a million." Huston's World War 1 film, The African Queen, tells the story of American Rose Sayer - played by Katharine Hepburn - who escapes a village burned down in German East Africa on a boat owned by rough-and-ready Charlie Allnutt, played by Bogart. It won Bogart the best actor Oscar in 1952. The 11 glasses were being sold by antique glass dealers Mark J West, of Redhill, Surrey, at the 23rd Winter Fine Art and Antiques Fair at London Olympia. </body>

      <body>A group of people dressed as Batman, Robin, David Hasselhoff and a Smurf helped police officers catch a criminal in an East Lothian supermarket. A man dressed as Robin was on Eskview Road in Musselburgh when he was assaulted just before 20:00 on Friday. He and his friends, who were all in fancy dress, called police before chasing the attacker into Tesco. After a scuffle in the toilet roll aisle, a 21-year-old man was arrested. He later pled guilty in court. The incident came to light after East Lothian Police tweeted about it, thanking the fancy-dressed group for their help. One Tweet read: "Thank you to Batman, Robin, Robin's Dad, a Smurf, and the Hoff for helping us on Friday night. #Tesco, sorry about the toilet roll aisle." Another Tweet by police officers in East Lothian read: "Robin assaulted, police called, collective assisted our foot chase, minor upset to shelving in Tescos during arrest, you couldn't script it!" A Police Scotland spokesman said: "A 21-year-old man was arrested and charged in connection with an assault in Eskview Road, Musselburgh, on Friday 1 November. "He was remanded in custody until Monday 4th November, where he appeared in court and pled guilty to the offence." </body>

      <title>NIE told price rise must be smaller</title>
      <description>Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) is told it can only raise the average bill by £5 per year until 2017, not the £25 per year it had wanted.</description>

      <body>The Competition Commission has told Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) it cannot raise its prices by as much as it wanted to over the next five years. NIE controls the power grid in Northern Ireland and its charges account for about 20% of a typical household electricity bill. It wanted to raise bills by about £25 a year up to 2017. However, the commission has ruled that the increase should only be around £5 a year. That will now be put out to consultation. NIE said it needed the money for investment in the grid but the commission said its ruling "strikes the right balance" between the company and consumers. In April, the Competition Commission was called to settle a dispute between NIE and the utility regulator. NIE wants to increase substantially the amount of money spent upgrading its infrastructure. However, the regulator said the plans would add too much to bills and then referred the matter to the commission. NIE had been strongly critical of the regulator on the issue. Martin Cave of the commission said they had been able to increase the amount of money that could be put into investment in the grid compared to what the utility regulatory had proposed, but also came up with a much smaller rise in bills compared to that proposed by NIE. In a statement, NIE said: "We welcome the publication of the provisional determination and will submit our response by the due date 29 November 2013. "The Competition Commission will be holding further hearings to discuss responses to the provisional determination during December and we expect the final determination to be published in February 2014." The utility regulator said it welcomed the publication of the Competition Commission's determination. "The detailed determination will be made available shortly and we will consider the findings carefully and engage further with the Competition Commission during the consultation period," a spokesperson said. </body>

      <title>City hospital in Savile allegation</title>
      <description>An allegation against Jimmy Savile relating to a Cardiff hospital has been investigated, health officials say.</description>

      <body>Health officials have investigated an allegation against Jimmy Savile relating to Cardiff Royal Infirmary. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said an adult reported an incident from the early 1960s and it was working with police on the matter. The hospital is one of 13 under investigation in the UK following revelations about decades of abuse carried out by the former Radio 1 DJ. Final reports on the investigations are due in June 2014. The disclosure that Cardiff Royal Infirmary was involved in the inquiry was made in a written Parliamentary answer by health minister Norman Lamb. In a statement on Thursday night, the health board said: "Cardiff and Vale University Health Board can confirm that it has investigated one allegation from an adult relating to an alleged incident at Cardiff Royal Infirmary in the early 1960s. "The health board is working closely with South Wales Police and the Department of Health on the matter and is not in a position to comment further at this time." The question in Parliament had been tabled by former children's minister Tim Loughton MP. In his answer, Mr Lamb revealed there were 13 hospitals being investigated. Many of them had previously been identified, but this was the first time that a hospital in Wales had been named as being part of the inquiry. An investigation has also been commissioned by the Sue Ryder charity in relation to Wheatfields Hospice in Leeds. In October UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation reports are thorough and complete, and reflect all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending. "The final reports of all the investigations will now aim to be completed by June 2014, with publication sooner if that is possible." The Welsh government has been asked to comment. Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is believed to have abused hundreds of victims during his 50-year career as a radio and TV personality. The Metropolitan Police launched a formal criminal investigation into Savile's alleged offences on 19 October 2012, called Operation Yewtree. In January, police and the NSPCC published a joint report - Giving Victims a Voice - on Savile's sexual offending. Key points included that the earliest recorded Savile offence was in 1955, with the most recent in 2009. His offending was most frequent during the period 1966-1976 when he was between 40 and 50 years old. Reports of offences at the BBC spanned more than 40 years, from 1965 to 2006. It said Savile's youngest victim was an eight-year-old boy. The oldest was 47, while most were aged 13-16. The report said 73% of his victims were under 18 and 82% were female. Offences were said to be mainly opportunistic sexual assaults, but there were others where an element of grooming or planning was said to have occurred. Victims' recorded crimes including 126 indecent acts and 34 rapes or similar offences. Cardiff Royal Infirmary opened in 1884 and closed as a district general hospital in 1999 but has since been used as a base for community health services. It is currently undergoing a £30m revamp. </body>

      <title>Landlord fear over welfare reform</title>
      <description>A private sector landlord with more than 700 homes says benefit changes could put his business at risk.</description>

      <body>A private sector landlord with more than 700 homes says benefit changes could put his business at risk. Carmarthenshire-based Kevin Green fears tenants will fall behind on their rent when a new system of paying benefits is introduced. He says he may have to stop letting to people on welfare. The UK government says it is restoring fairness to the welfare system, and that it is working on protecting landlords and tenants. Most of the 762 properties Mr Green lets are in or near Llanelli. Around 60% of his tenants receive benefits, he says. Last month the UK government began phasing in one of its big welfare reforms - Universal Credit. The roll-out is due to finish in October 2017. Next spring Shotton, Flintshire, will become the first part of Wales where it is introduced. Six working-age benefits - including housing benefit - will be merged into one monthly payment into the claimant's bank account. A trial of the system in Torfaen among social housing tenants found arrears rose from around £20,000 to almost £140,000 in seven months. Private sector tenants already have their housing benefit paid to them, rather than it going directly to the landlord. But millionaire Mr Green, who experienced homelessness in 1984, said he feared some would struggle with their household finances and fail to keep up with the rent when benefits are merged. "What we're finding is if rent payment is put in the tenants' hands they are not being taught in school or further education to run a home and they just can't budget," he told BBC Wales Sunday Politics. "And it's going to lead to huge arrears. It could lead to us going bust at the end of the day and not providing homes for less fortunate people as well." He added: "If we pull out the market that's hundreds of houses that we rent out in this area that's pulled out. "We're the UK's largest private sector landlord. We pull those out of the social welfare market and that's houses that people haven't got to live on housing benefit." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: "Our reforms restore fairness to a system that was allowed to spiral out of control. "We are working now to ensure that the right protection and exemptions are in place for both tenants and landlords ahead of Universal Credit. "Direct payments are an important part of Universal Credit to make it easier for people to move into work, but we've been clear from the outset that we will take steps to protect vulnerable people." The Sunday Politics Wales can be seen from 12:25 on BBC1 Wales on Sunday. </body>

      <body>Provision for cyclists has improved at a number of councils across Scotland over recent years, a study has found. Cycling Scotland said the top performing councils were Glasgow, Edinburgh, Fife and Aberdeenshire. Its report found that others still needed to do more in terms of developing infrastructure, resources and leadership. The study will be launched by Channel 4 newsreader and keen cyclist Jon Snow at Glasgow's Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome. Cycling Scotland rated the performance of every Scottish council in their efforts to get more people cycling. The organisation said all 32 councils participated, with some performing extremely well and others needing a more focused approach. The 2013 edition of the report follows two previous assessments carried out in 2005 and 2008. Councils found to have greatly improved their approach to cycle use were Aberdeenshire, Clackmannanshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Highland, North Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and Stirling. Mr Snow, who is also president of national cycling charity CTC, said: "Having the right infrastructure is vital to getting people out on their bikes. "Good quality segregated cycle lanes make cycling safer and give people who are nervous about mixing with traffic the confidence to travel through towns and cities on a bike. "This type of infrastructure has to be planned, designed and installed at a local level, and so local authority commitment is essential." Cycling Scotland has called for consideration to be given to cycling across council policies and strategies, including infrastructure, promotion, monitoring and understanding the needs of local cyclists. Chief executive Ian Aitken added: "I hope that the analysis in the report, along with the areas for development we've highlighted, will support more local authorities to develop local cycling strategies, as recommended in the Cycling Action Plan for Scotland." </body>

      <body>A woman has baked an "almost life-sized" Johnny Depp cake for a competition. Lara Clarke, an amateur baker from Brownhills, West Midlands, made the Pirates of the Caribbean-inspired creation for the Cake International competition in Birmingham. She said: "The judges are probably more used to seeing three-tier wedding cakes than giant Jack Sparrows." A competition spokesperson said entrants' creativity was "surprising". Ms Clarke, who is entering the 5ft 5in (1.65m) cake in the large decorative exhibit section of the competition, said she had only started baking two years ago. "All I'd really made before was some bog-standard banana cake in home economics," she said. "The first time I baked a decorated cake was for my mother-in-law's 25th wedding anniversary. I thought it was rubbish but everybody else seemed to like it." Since then, Ms Clarke has baked cakes for family and friends. Previous efforts have included a 4ft (1.2m) Grinch cake, a motorbike and a cake replica of her mother-in-law. Ms Clarke, who works for a bingo website, said she learned her skills from watching YouTube videos. The Johnny Depp cake is the first time she has attempted anything on such a large scale. "One of my friends was on the phone and said I should enter Cake International," she said. "At the time I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean. I was watching Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, and I thought he would make the perfect cake. "He wears all these different fabrics, so he has lots of different textures to him. "He's just shy of life-size because I was worried we wouldn't be able to get him out of the door. "It took me 90 hours to make. We live with my fiancé's parents and I think they will be pleased to get rid of it. "When my father-in-law first saw him, he leapt about 10ft in the air thinking we had burglars." Ms Clarke has hired a minibus to take Johnny to the competition on Friday. The results will be known on Sunday. She said: "The competition is like the Crufts of the baking world. People like Mary Berry will be there." A spokesperson for Cake International said: "There really is no limit to the talent and ingenuity of the competitors." </body>

      <body>A roller coaster has reopened five days after wheels fell off and hit four people in the front carriage. The Smiler at Alton Towers was shut on Saturday after the guide wheels hit riders in the face and shoulder as it went up an incline. A spokeswoman for the park said they had been working with designers to review and replace elements connected to part of the ride affected. She said the £18m ride opened at 10:30 GMT on Thursday after safety checks. "In line with our operational procedures, the ride was closed following the incident at the weekend and we have been working with the designers to review and replace all of the elements connected to this part of the ride," she said. "We remain committed to ensuring that all of our rides meet the highest standards in all areas and we are sorry for any disappointment caused by The Smiler's recent unavailability." The ride opened in May and includes a drop of 30m (98ft) and 14 loops. Its closure follows another incident on 21 July when 48 people had to be rescued. It closed again in August for five days due to a "technical issue". </body>

      <body>Manager Chris Coleman will meet Football Association of Wales officials on Friday to discuss a new contract. The 43-year-old, whose current deal will end after the game against Finland on 16 November, has been linked with the vacant position at Crystal Palace. John Hartson said on Wednesday he would stand down as Coleman's assistant. Speculation over Coleman's future increased after Friday's news conference to name the squad to face Finland was cancelled. "We have discussed it with Chris and we have decided to release the squad by email because it would be a worthless exercise holding a press conference when all the questions will be about Chris's contract and Crystal Palace," a Football Association of Wales spokesman said. "We are not hiding anything. Chris will be in Cardiff on Friday." BBC Sport has learnt a new contract for Coleman will be on the agenda at his meeting with FAW officials, with just eight days to go before his current deal expires. Former Wales international Coleman took over as national manager in January 2012 following the death of Gary Speed. Despite failing to lead his side to the 2014 World Cup finals, Wales completed their Group A campaign with victory over Macedonia followed by a 1-1 draw against group winners Belgium. Coleman's men finished fifth after three wins, a draw and six defeats. "If I had lost the two games, I wouldn't have been expecting to have been told I wasn't the man to take us forward," the former Fulham manager said after his side's final two qualifiers. "Equally, two great results does not mean I expect to be told I am the man to take us forward." However, FAW chief executive Jonathan Ford had previously told BBC Radio Wales that Coleman would not have been judged on the results of those final games. Midfielder Joe Ledley and full-back Neil Taylor have both stated that they would like the former defender to remain in charge of the national team. Crystal Palace - where Coleman spent four years as a player - have been looking for a new manager after Ian Holloway left the position last month. </body>

      <body>Jermain Defoe scored a club-record 23rd European goal to give Tottenham victory over Sheriff Tiraspol and a place in the Europa League knockout stages. The England striker scored a penalty to move ahead of Martin Chivers and add to Erik Lamela's first goal for the club. Lamela finished calmly before earning Spurs their penalty when fouled by Djibril Paye after a mazy run. The hosts' defence was breached for the first time in Europe this season when Ismail Isa scored, but they held on. There was a sense of relief mixed with inevitability when Lamela hooked home on the hour as Tottenham, with nine changes from their draw against Everton, had laboured towards an expected victory. An uneventful first half gave hope to their Moldovan visitors, who have never won away in the Europa League, but a second-half double secured Spurs's sixth win in Europe this season and progression from Group K. Andre Villas-Boas's side are through two games quicker than last season - and the win extended an impressive run of form which has seen them lose just twice in 18 matches. Record signing Lamela was influential throughout and threatened tentatively in a first half void of clear openings for the home side. The Argentine had a half-hearted penalty appeal turned down early on before a long-range effort from team-mate Mousa Dembele forced the first save of the game from Vjekoslav Tomic. Spurs, though, struggled to penetrate the visitors and it was a quickfire break led by attacking midfielder Ricardinho which fashioned the half's best opening for the visitors as Isa's shot beat Brad Friedel but cannoned back off the post. Friedel was deputising for Hugo Lloris, rested after being knocked out in the draw with Everton, and the 42-year-old was able to watch on as Ricardinho then shot wide from a good opening. Defoe could not turn home Gylfi Sigurdsson's cross on the stroke of half-time, but his and Spurs's fortunes improved as Lamela gained in influence after the break. Christian Eriksen smashed a shot from range which drew a good save from Tomic before the Danish midfielder inadvertently found Lamela 12 yards from goal for the 21-year-old to finish crisply. The former Roma player's weaving run into the area drew a touch from Paye seven minutes later, allowing Defoe to lift his penalty high into the net in front of the watching Chivers. Five minutes later, Friedel could only parry Cadu's shot into his six-yard box allowing Isa to volley home a consolation, but Spurs comfortably held on and a point in Tromso in three weeks' time will likely prove enough for them to top the group. </body>

      <description>Scotland keep their hopes of a World Cup quarter-final spot alive with a 22-8 win against the United States in Salford.</description>

      <body>Scotland kept their hopes of a World Cup quarter-final spot alive with a 22-8 victory against the USA in Salford. Tries from Kristian Freed and Taylor Welch gave the USA an eight-point lead, but Scotland responded with three scores in 12 minutes after the break. Brett Phillips, Matty Russell and Luke Douglas all went over, before Alex Hurst made the game safe. Despite the win, Scotland will only progress to the last eight if Italy fail to beat Tonga on Sunday. With the two sides level on points difference, the Azzurri are certain to top Group C if they are successful in Halifax. The Bravehearts had already surpassed their best-ever performance at a World Cup even before Thursday's success, but an unbeaten record in their group still may not be enough for them to feature in the knockout stages. If they do qualify, it is unlikely that Ben Fisher will be able to participate in a potential quarter-final against holders New Zealand. The London Broncos hooker, who has announced he will retire at the end of the tournament, was injured in the warm-up and appeared in an emotional state as he was helped from the field by Scotland's medical staff. Terry Matterson's USA, playing in their first World Cup, went into their inter-group encounter at the AJ Bell Stadium with the luxury of knowing their spot in the last eight and a probable tie with tournament favourites Australia was already secure. The Tomahawks had the better of the opening exchanges and broke the deadlock when a flat pass from half-back Joseph Paulo, so influential in their earlier victories against the Cook Islands and Wales, picked out Freed. The full-back dived over from close range, although he and his team-mates appeared somewhat surprised when the try was eventually awarded by video referee Henry Perenara. Scotland almost responded straight from the restart but they were twice denied, as first centre Ben Hellewell was held up over the whitewash and then Hurst's effort was ruled out for a forward pass. Their desperation to get back on terms showed when Dale Ferguson was penalised for a dangerous tackle and put on report by on-field official Thierry Alibert, while their frustration grew further when centre Welch touched down Craig Priestly's grubber kick to extend the Americans' advantage. Scotland needed some inspiration and their reliable half-back partnership almost provided it, as Peter Wallace and Danny Brough combined for skipper Brough to cross under the posts, only for Perenara to intervene again and judge that the Scots had been guilty of obstruction during the build-up. They finally registered their first points shortly after the interval when second-rower Phillips collected Brough's pass to score, and when Brough - Super League's Man of Steel - converted Russell's try from a darting run two minutes later, Scotland were suddenly two points in front. Opposing wingers Hurst - playing in his home-town stadium - and Matthew Petersen both spurned opportunities before a powerful effort from forward Douglas just past the hour mark sent Scotland further clear. Hurst's late try, again set up by Brough, sealed victory during a fractious conclusion to the game, and they now face an anxious wait before their World Cup fate is decided. Scotland: Russell; Hurst, Hellewell, Addy, Scott; Brough, Wallace; Walker, A. Henderson, Douglas, Phillips, Ferguson, Kavanagh. Replacements: Barlow, Szostak, Stringer, Wilkes. USA: Freed; Faraimo, Welch, Garvey, Petersen; Paulo, Priestly; Offerdahl, Samoa, Pettybourne, Newton, Shipway, Howard. Replacements: Marando, Hifo, Luani, Lavulo.

      <description>Seventy five years after Kristallnacht - the night of violence against Jews in Germany which ended in mass murder - how strong is anti-Semitism in Germany?</description>

      <body>It's 75 years since the pogroms that became known as Kristallnacht - the night of broken glass. It was the outbreak of mass violence against Jews which was to end in their mass murder. As the anniversary is marked, how strong - or weak - is anti-Semitism in Germany today? Ruth Recknagel remembers the feral looting. Even today, 75 years later, she recalls people swarming around the broken windows of Jewish shops in Berlin and then snatching what they could. Ruth was born in 1930, so on 9 November, 1938 she was only eight years old. She walked around the shattered glass at Potsdamer Platz with her Jewish father. What she witnessed remains imprinted on her mind. "It was a decisive break," she says. "It was the start. From then on, everything got worse." Others remembered the way the pogroms unfolded into an organised orgy of violence. There was unrestrained grabbing from shops as well as attacks on schools and even hospitals. The Daily Telegraph correspondent in Berlin at the time, Michael Bruce, recounted "one of the foulest exhibitions of bestiality" he had ever witnessed when rioters broke into a hospital for sick Jewish children. Tiny children were being chased "over the broken glass, bare-footed and wearing nothing but their nightshirts," Bruce wrote. "The nurses, doctors, and attendants were being kicked and beaten by the mob leaders, most of whom were women." The November pogroms marked the start of the Holocaust. After it, the gloves were truly off. Jews had been persecuted from 1933 - barred from ever more jobs, routinely insulted and attacked. But Kristallnacht was the step-change in escalation. Any pretence and restraint vanished. The shattered glass of Kristallnacht led to the death camps. And that is not forgotten in Germany today. It is taught in schools and remembered from podiums occupied by the chancellor of Germany down. But how much anti-Semitism lingers despite the knowledge of what happened? It is a complex picture. There is, for example, a growing Jewish population in Germany. It is small at less than 1% of the total population (and much smaller than the 5% of the population with a Turkish background, for example). But it is a community which is growing rapidly, and people don't tend to migrate to a more hostile environment than the one they left. The Israeli embassy in Berlin estimates that there are about 10,000 Israelis in Berlin alone, many of them drawn by the cultural life. The city abounds with Israeli sculptors, painters and musicians who often say they have found a home conducive to artistic creation. There is, though, sometimes resentment from other Jews. I've been in a meeting where a visiting American-Jewish author rounded on the Israelis there who had moved to Germany to live and work. How could they look at themselves in the mirror, the angry author taunted the Israeli immigrants to Germany. Every two years, the University of Bielefeld conducts a rigorous study of attitudes in Germany. Its most recent survey suggested that about 20% of the German population had what it called "latent anti-Semitism" - some sort of quiet, unspoken antipathy towards Jews. They tease out attitudes towards minorities by asking a series of indirect questions about blame for the financial crisis, for example, or who has excessive influence. A further 5-10% showed overt anti-Semitism. The study concluded: "The significantly strongest agreement with anti-Semitic prejudices is found in Poland and Hungary. In Portugal, followed closely by Germany, anti-Semitism is significantly more prominent than in the other western European countries. In Italy and France, anti-Semitic attitudes as a whole are less widespread than the European average, while the extent of anti-Semitism is least in Great Britain and the Netherlands." Jews in Germany often say, though, that they find much more anti-Semitism when they go abroad. One person told the BBC she had experienced far worse prejudice in Britain than she had at home in Germany - in a Cambridge college, ham was sometimes placed in her postbox. Rabbis often praise the German government for its outspoken condemnation of anti-Semitism. "Germany is certainly doing a lot to fight anti-Semitism," says Prof Walter Homolka, the director of Abraham Geiger College at the University of Potsdam. "Whether it is ever going to be enough, that's a big question. We can only hope to keep this figure of 20% in check." He says the public statements and the presence of people from Chancellor Angela Merkel down at big Jewish events is important as a signal to the rest of the population. Chancellor Merkel has said that an attack on Jews is an attack on everyone. And responding to a young Jewish student who had pointed out that Jewish institutions in Germany still need police protection, she said recently that the people of Germany needed "civil courage". What does seem to be clear is that anti-Semitism is rising in Germany. "Anti-Semitism is acceptable again," says the foundation's director, Anetta Kahane from the Amadeu Antonio Foundation which campaigns against racism. "It must be said clearly - those who say something anti-Semitic tacitly legitimise physical attacks on Jews." The foundation has collated official figures which say that in 2011, there were 811 attacks on Jews. These were of various degrees of intimidation, from verbal attacks to physical assault, and included 16 violent attacks. In 2012, that rose to 865 attacks in total, with 27 of them being violent. In the first half of this year, the rise seems to have continued, with 409 attacks, 16 of them violent. A year ago, Rabbi Daniel Alter was attacked by a group of youths of Middle Eastern appearance as he walked with his young daughter. "They made threats of violence against female members of my family, including my seven-year-old daughter who was by my side," he says. One man confronted him very aggressively before striking him: "With his first hit he broke my cheek bone. There was another man hitting me from behind, hitting me either with his fist or something else on my head, and I fell to the floor. The next thing is I saw them running away." It has made him change his life. Seventy five years after Kristallnacht, he feels he can no longer wear his skullcap openly in some areas of Berlin, and covers it with a hat. And he has re-doubled his efforts to visit schools and talk to children - often alongside an Imam from a mosque. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>The ignorance test</title>

      <body>The world may have many problems, from climate change to armed conflict, natural disasters, poverty and the oppression of women and minorities - but where does population growth fit into this catalogue of woes? With the population of the world at seven billion and rising, many fear a shortage of resources as well as a shortage of space. Swedish professor Hans Rosling, however, says it's time for a reality check. When pollsters got 1,000 British people to take Rosling's "ignorance survey" in May this year, the results suggested they knew "less about the world than chimpanzees", he says. Take a version of the test in this quiz, compare your results with the British respondents', then read Hans Rosling's five reasons the world is in better shape than we think. "If for each question I wrote each of the possible alternatives on bananas, and asked chimpanzees in the zoo to pick the right answers, and by picking the right bananas, they'd just pick bananas at random. But the Brits did even worse," says Rosling. To be fair, so did the Swedes, the only other nation to have been polled so far. In a speech to TED downloaded almost six million times, he points out that he also put the questions to some fellow professors, and they were on a par with chimpanzees, too. The fact that humans do worse than chimps shows the problem is not a lack of knowledge, but the result of having preconceived ideas, Rosling says - ideas that are years, or sometimes decades out of date. "What is particularly striking is that those with a university education did not do better - if anything worse - than everyone else," he says. Rosling infers from this that most people are ignorant about the profound ways the world is changing, "often for the better". Some "ignorance survey" questions - and the British answers: Question: In the year 2000 the total number of children (age 0-14) in the world reached two billion. How many do UN experts estimate there will be by the year 2100? Question: What percentage of adults in the world today are literate - ie can read and write? Question: What is the life expectancy in the world as a whole today? Question: In the last 30 years the proportion of the world population living in extreme poverty has… Question: What percentage of total world energy generated comes from solar and wind power? Is it approximately... Don't Panic - The Truth About Population will be broadcast on BBC Two on Thursday 7 November at 21:00 GMT (23:20 GMT in Scotland. Or watch it later on the BBC iPlayer. Hans Rosling answered readers' questions on @BBCNewsMagazine's Twitter account. Here is a selection of the questions and answers. Q: Should there be a global population cap? The globe can only support a finite number of people. A: Of course not. You would have to kill, sterilise by force or at least stop public child welfare. Q: How will the population be divided based on age, considering the increasing age of population overall A: It is not so much increased age, it is a higher proportion old because fewer and fewer are born. Q: What about the environment? We already need 1.5 earths to supply our needs, with 7 billion people in the world. A: We must obviously be much more clever in using resources, regulate with tax and promote innovations Q: Do you think in 80 years traditional developed nations will pay people to immigrate as they won't have enough labour? A: Yes, Vietnamese migrants are yearly picking the wild lingonberries in the Swedish forests. Q: What is the biggest problem facing the human race today that is not being addressed? A: I don't know, it´s probably a problem we have not yet understood how big it will soon be. Q: How much does media coverage of female education and poverty in Indian sub-continent etc. influence our beliefs? A: It seems the public in Europe has not yet learnt that most girls in India today go to school. Q: Should borders be abolished to encourage the free movement of individuals? A: In my dreams it happens, when I wake up I just hope for an even better and stronger UN. Q: Do you think the gap between rich and poor nations will narrow as it has between rich and poor in western Europe? A: The gap is gone. Most nations are in the middle, some richer and some poorer. Q: Of all possible threats from exhaustion of resources which will finally cause us to see what we've already lost? A: May be the exhaustion of resources that leads to a war that is worse than the exhaustion. Q: At what date and at what number do you envisage that the human population will stabilise? A: I just follow what the UN experts estimate, second part of this century, at 9-12bn. Q: Why were your test results surprising amongst university students? Is it important for everyone to go to uni? A: I (naively) thought university training would make you better in following what happens in the world. Q: Given trouble our consumption is causing, surely we should panic at the prospect of a 50% increase to 11bn people? A: Britain didn't win WWII by panicking. Let´s be bold, determined and stick to the best of values. Q: How will the Japanese economy cope with its expected substantial decline in population over the coming decades? A: In strange ways. In Japan sale of geriatric diapers is now bigger than baby diapers. Q: Will the world population be able to have the quality of life that the middle class in the developed world enjoys? A: Hopefully yes, otherwise we will get tragic conflicts in the world. Q: We get energy from food that comes largely from the sun. Is that part of the 2% that comes from solar and wind? A: Food and feed is not conventional part of the concept "energy production". Q: Why is the world in better shape? Are we misinformed? A: Most people are not updated. 50 years ago 1 in 5 children died before age 5, now only 1 in 20! Q: Do you think the reason university graduates performed less well is due to becoming cynical while studying? A: Truly, I do not know, but Gapminder will investigate why. Q: What's the likely impact on mortality and population as people migrate to areas with better food and water supplies? A: The most important migration is to cities. In poorest countries this improves health. Q: At what point will population pressure next spark a major war? A: It may be an underlying factor behind conflicts about land in the poorest countries. </body>

      <title>Commons debates EU referendum plans</title>
      <description>MPs are to debate a Conservative MP's plans for a referendum to be held in 2017 on the UK's future membership of the European Union.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24859102</url>

      <body>MPs are debating plans for a referendum on the UK's future membership of the European Union. Tory MP James Wharton's bill is set to face blocking tactics by Labour opponents of it. The legislation, backed by the Conservative leadership but not the Liberal Democrats, calls for a referendum by the end of 2017. The MP said people should "have their say" but there was "little support" in his party for a poll before 2017. Mr Wharton's fellow Conservative, Adam Afriyie, has proposed an amendment calling for the referendum to happen in October next year instead - arguing that delaying a vote for four years will play into the hands of UKIP. Debate on Mr Wharton's bill is scheduled to take place between 09:30 to 14:30 GMT, the first of three days when it will be considered in detail by MPs. The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said he expected Labour MPs to filibuster in an effort to derail the bill, making long speeches about related issues in an effort to slow its progress. The prime minister's promise of a referendum by the end of 2017, following a renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels, cannot be made law in the form of a coalition government bill because of Lib Dem opposition. Mr Wharton agreed to propose the legislation after he came top in a ballot of MPs and many Tories pushed for the referendum commitment to be made binding before the 2015 general election. MPs backed the principle of the EU Referendum bill by 304 to none after a debate in July, with Lib Dems and Labour boycotting the vote. The bill has now reached its "report stage", where amendments can be discussed in detail. More than 50 amendments have been tabled, including Mr Afriyie's and 36 alone by Labour's Mike Gapes. Mr Wharton said he hoped the bill would progress to its next stage and suggested the Conservatives were "absolutely united" over the need to consult the people about the UK's membership. "It is pretty hard in a democracy to deny people a choice on such a fundamental and important issue," he said. Asked about Mr Afriyie's amendment, he said: "One Conservative MP has said 'I think perhaps we should look at a different date' and what we have found in recent months is that there is not a lot of support for that." But Mr Afriyie said the prospect of a referendum in 2017 was "pie in the sky", given uncertainty over the result of the next election, and urged fellow MPs to "settle the question" now. "This can has been kicked down the road time and time again," he said. "We are in danger of doing this again today." Mr Afriyie, reported earlier this year to have leadership ambitions, denied that the amendment was a attempt to raise his profile. "It is not about me. It is about the British people having a say." Private members' bills have little chance of becoming law due to lack of parliamentary time, unless they are backed by the government. Tory MPs are under a "three line whip" to support the bill but few are actually expected to speak in Friday's debate amid concerns about opposition attempts to delay the bill's progress. Foreign Secretary William Hague has written to all Conservative MPs to urge them to make their remarks "short and pithy" and to consult Mr Wharton before putting themselves forward to speak. If it looks like the legislation will be "talked out" by opponents giving long speeches, Mr Wharton can ask for a "closure motion". If backed by a majority of MPs, numbering at least 100, this would allow the bill to be voted on as a whole. If the bill makes it through the Commons, it will go to the Lords for further discussion in the next few months. Ahead of the debate, the boss of car giant Nissan has warned the firm would reconsider its investment in the UK if it left the EU. Mr Wharton said he did not want to do anything to endanger one of the largest employers in the north east of England but the existing "uncertainty" about the UK's position in the EU needed to be addressed. "The EU is changing before our eyes. The way to resolve that is to have a proper debate and make a decision." </body>

      <body>Labour MP Shaun Woodward, who became a cabinet minister after defecting from the Conservatives, is to stand down at the next general election. Mr Woodward, who enjoyed a majority of more than 14,000 in St Helen's South and Whiston at the last election, switched to Labour in 1999. He eventually became Northern Ireland Secretary under Gordon Brown. Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Woodard had served with "great distinction" as an MP and minister. Mr Miliband said the MP's defection had taken "personal courage and political commitment" and that Labour would "be forever grateful to you". Writing to confirm his resignation, Mr Woodward said he would focus on human rights issues after leaving Parliament. Mr Woodward was elected as Tory MP for Witney in Oxfordshire in 1997, but quit the seat after one parliamentary term. While David Cameron succeeded him as Witney's Tory MP, Mr Woodward went on to win St Helen's South and Whiston, in Merseyside, one of Labour's strongholds, at the 2001 general election. Mr Woodward had fallen out with the Conservative leadership after backing the repeal of Clause 28, which banned councils and schools in England and Wales from intentionally promoting homosexuality. He is married to Sainsbury's heiress Camilla Sainsbury, daughter of the former Conservative MP Tim Sainsbury. A Cambridge graduate, Mr Woodward worked as a researcher and programme editor at the BBC and as head of press for the Conservatives before entering politics. </body>

      <title>MSPs endorse gay marriage bill</title>
      <description>Legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland is backed by the Holyrood committee looking into the proposals.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-24857052</url>

      <body>Legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland has been backed by the Holyrood committee looking into the proposals. Most MSPs on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill. But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic Church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, said: "All of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. "While the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the Scottish Parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience." The Bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration. Tom French, of the Equality Network charity, said backing the Bill would help remove discrimination from law. "With just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage Bill, we urge MSPs to stand up for a fairer and more equal Scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support," he said. "The large majority of people in Scotland believe it's time LGBT people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This Bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are." But campaign group Scotland for Marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it. A spokesman said: "The Scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. "Real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of Scots who don't support this law. "No one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected." In England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act was passed into law in July. It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place. The act will allow religious organisations to "opt in" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so. </body>

      <body>A national deferred payment scheme to help people pay for their social care costs in old age should be created, according to local councillors in England. The Local Government Association (LGA) says that ministers could set up a company to lend money which would be paid back from a person's estate when they die. Several local authorities run such a system but the LGA wants a nationwide scheme. Michael Buchanan reports. </body>

      <body>For two decades, millions of companies, predominantly in North America and Europe, have invited staff to bring their offspring to the office for a taste of grown-up working life, for one day a year. Feminist and writer Gloria Steinem and the Ms. Foundation for Women in the US began the promotion of the day in 1993, so daughters could accompany parents to work, improve their professional aspirations, and their self-esteem. It was expanded to include boys 10 years later. So what about parents curious about what their adult children are getting up to all day? Is there a value in putting faces to names, and in seeing firsthand what sons and daughters are talking about when the topic of work is discussed over family dinners? LinkedIn, the professional networking site, has designated 7 November the day the tables are turned, and launched the first "Bring In Your Parents Day". So what about life in the BBC's Business and Economics newsroom? I asked my mother, Patricia, to come in and see what I do, after years of her hearing me speak in "BBC jargon" about the world of news. She had a long career as an orthoptist, looking after eye problems, and is recently retired. Her initial response was a little lukewarm. In a text she asked, "How long do I have to stay?" So instead of subjecting her to a 10-hour news shift, she came in just after lunch. It was, touchingly, a cause of unexpected excitement amongst the online team. Though I feared that my well-meaning mother would be unable to stop herself tidying some of the messier desks in the office. She might also notice her empty cake tin that I keep forgetting to return months after I'd made muffins for colleagues. (She did.) When she arrived, Twitter's shares had just started trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a big story for the department, which we have been following closely. So I had to temporarily abandon my mother, before a colleague could take over from me. "Everyone looks very busy," Mum says. "Also because it's about business, it's not a world that I am familiar with. There's a lot of terms and words that we don't use in everyday life." She adds that seeing things from the inside helps to "make clear the pressure of deadlines in this kind of environment". She was also surprised to see correspondents and editors that she'd previously seen on TV, like Robert Peston, sitting inches away from the rest of us. Companies in 14 countries are taking part in Bring In Your Parents Day. From ZSL London Zoo to public relations firms and even some in the banking sector, parents are spending the day in the offices of their not-so-little darlings. Liam Fay-Fright from the advertising agency Mother, where his staff are taking part in the initiative, says his company sees it as an opportunity to remind their staff of a world outside a creative media "bubble". "I think having our parents around for the day will help to keep us all grounded." Is he worried that this will be a day where not a lot of work will be done? "The loss of productivity will be made up for in gaining an insight and a reality check for the people who work in advertising," he says. "Meeting people's parents is always interesting anyway, and people do find it hard to explain to their parents what it is they do." Darain Faraz, from LinkedIn's press team says the idea came after a colleague repeatedly failed to properly explain what she does to her mother. "About six months ago we were chatting and a colleague said her mother had asked her to write a paragraph about what it is they do. I do think there's a disconnect with the generations when it comes to the world of work. Especially in media and online companies." So what are my mother's conclusions on my job? "It does seem quite tense as there are a lot of breaking news stories," she says. As well as being surprised to see so many different things going on in the one room. "It is also really good to put faces to names, especially when it comes to the bosses. "I am glad I came." As Linkedin's Darain Faraz says: "It is maybe a bit like a grown-up parents evening." </body>

      <body>Boxing can turn the bright-eyed and bushy-tailed into the cynical and contorted, seemingly overnight. Look into their jaundiced eyes, listen to their weary words and you enter a world of crossed-out, ripped-up, stomped-upon storylines. So sup up the youthful vigour of Great Britain's glorious Olympians Anthony Joshua  and Luke Campbell while you can. Because the flavour might run out before long. "You get back from an Olympics and you're hot property," says James DeGale, who won gold for Britain at the 2008 Games in Beijing.   "I'd done my country proud, I signed for the biggest promoter in Europe in Frank Warren. But after my first professional fight, when I got booed, I thought to myself: 'Right, this ain't all glitz and glamour. That stuff fades, this is some serious stuff.'" On 16 November, DeGale fights Dyah Davis at the Bluewater shopping centre in Kent. Vegas it isn't. Almost five years, 17 fights and plenty of lumps and bumps into his professional career, the promised land still seems a long way off. "I definitely thought I'd have fought for a world title by now," adds the 27-year-old, who at least has terrestrial television exposure on Channel 5. "But with politics and problems with promoters [DeGale left Warren for Mick Hennessy last September], things slowed down a touch. Pro boxing's not just a sport, it's a business - the hardest business in the world." No British Olympic boxing champion has won a professional world title. Chris Finnegan, who struck gold in 1968,  came closest, losing in valiant fashion to American light-heavyweight great Bob Foster in 1972. Sydney 2000 champion Audley Harrison  entered the pro ranks believing the medal dangling from his neck doubled as an amulet but soon discovered that gold grows old, like any other colour. Errol Christie  never competed at an Olympics but he was one of Britain's finest amateur talents, our very own Sugar Ray Leonard. But three years into his paid career he was all but washed up and never fought for a pro title. "Christie's heart," it was written, "sets questions his chin can't answer." Frankie Gavin was billed as a modern-day Christie - only better. Balletic foot movement, exquisite balance, the kid from Birmingham had pretty much everything. And still does, it's just that he momentarily lost it along the way. "In the end it was so easy for me as an amateur," says Gavin, who missed out on the 2008 Olympics after failing to make the weight but remains the only British boxer to win a world amateur title.  "I won my last 50 fights, everything was done for me at GB Boxing in Sheffield and when you're part of a team you can help each other. But when you turn pro you're on your own. I didn't realise how lonely it would be." An unhappy boxer tends to be an underperforming boxer and loneliness exacerbated by personal turmoil made Gavin a very unhappy boxer indeed. "I took my family up to Manchester and it was all right for a bit," says the 28-year-old. "But when I split up from my girlfriend I was doing it all on my own. And I was even lonelier." Besides his relationship ending in acrimonious circumstances, Gavin's grandmother died and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. In addition, Gavin felt unloved by some of those charged with guiding his career. "I remember almost falling over in front of one trainer," says Gavin, "and he said: 'I'm glad you didn't go over, that might have been my investment gone, my 10%.' It made me think. "I was on the brink of giving it all up. I said to Frank Warren: 'I'll get back in touch if I want to box again.'" Sitting next to Gavin, with his eyes wide open and his ears cocked, is his old team-mate Anthony Ogogo, a bronze medallist at the London Olympics.  Ogogo, on the books of American giants Golden Boy Promotions, is three fights into his pro career and as bushy-tailed as boxers come. But even he is becoming pitted by the game's hard truths. "I've never seen anyone as talented as Frankie," says the 24-year-old. "So it's weird to think it could have been all over almost before it started. "Then again, you hear so many horror stories in boxing - strife with promoters, trainers or managers. It's a hard enough game without all that so you need to know you've got the right people around you. People you can trust." Boxers are wont to blame everyone but themselves for their lack of progress. So it is refreshing to hear Gavin admitting his own mistakes and that he has taken steps to rectify them. Starting with getting the right people around him. People he can trust. "I got complacent because it all seemed too easy again, starting out in the pro ranks," says Gavin. "I thought all I had to do was box - pads, spar, pads, spar. But you've got to work on your weaknesses as well as your strengths. "Fighters I should have been smashing up I was having hard fights against, like Curtis Woodhouse. But when I went back to Birmingham my old amateur trainer, Tom Chaney, took over again. "He's like a father figure to me. He doesn't nag me for money if I don't get paid on time - he's not in it for money, he's in it for me." Head settled and body a temple once more, Gavin is now the British and Commonwealth welterweight champion and confident enough to be calling out Kell Brook and Amir Khan. DeGale, too, is "older and wiser". Free of hangers-on, less bombastic but painfully aware he remains lumbered with something of an image problem. "I learned a whole heap from my loss against George Groves," says DeGale of his only pro defeat, by his bitter domestic rival in 2011. "During the build-up I was a bit too vocal, telling him he was ugly and his breath smelt. Maybe I shouldn't have said that. "I read and hear people saying I'm flash and cocky and it does hurt a bit. Maybe it's just me being me. But the people who know me realise I'm a genuine, humble, down-to-earth boy." Ogogo may have his eyes wide open and both ears cocked - "James and Frankie have made mistakes I don't want to make" - but the chain of advice is unbroken from the time men first laced up gloves and the same mistakes get made. Over and over again. Proof that professional boxing isn't a sport, it isn't a business, it's a series of accidents - rather than mistakes - just waiting to happen. "I get a lot of stick," says DeGale, a former British and European super-middleweight champion and one or two fights away from a world title shot. "People telling me I'm greedy, that I'm always thinking about money, that I've messed up my career. But they don't understand. I love boxing, but it's hard, it's a short career and I want to get paid as much as I can and get out with my faculties intact. "I tell young fighters who train with me: 'Get in there, make some money and run.'" Which almost never happens. Not even if you turn up for your first day of work with a medal round your neck. "It's always there," says DeGale, "I'm always 'James Degale, Olympic champion'. But another Olympics comes around, new medallists arrive and they start taking the limelight." Leaving the old guard cynical and contorted, seemingly overnight. </body>

      <title>How 'Iron Man' McCoy became a legend</title>
      <description>How 'Iron Man' Tony McCoy became a legend</description>

      <body>Midweek on bleak winter days at lesser-known sporting venues like Market Rasen and Newton Abbot, a sporting phenomenon has unfolded over the last 20 years. Cold, sore, tired and underweight, one man has set new landmarks as the mud flies in his face, watched by a hardy band of supporters. Eighteen-time champion jockey AP McCoy's achievement in reaching an unprecedented milestone of 4,000 jump racing winners is unlikely to be bettered in several lifetimes. While tennis star Roger Federer was number one in his sport for 237 consecutive weeks, McCoy has been top in his for 937 - and counting. Those winners have been achieved at a career strike-rate of about 24%, when many of his leading competitors do well to reach 20%. The 39-year-old has been champion jockey every season since his first as a professional. Eighteen times on the trot since 1996. Mark Morrison topped the charts with Return Of The Mack as McCoy celebrated his first title. Like all his colleagues, the Northern Irishman risks his life every day in an arena where there are only four blank days in the calendar, and an ambulance follows every race. He has fallen an estimated 1,000 times from horses weighing half a tonne, travelling at speeds of up to 30mph. "He is made of concrete - they don't make people like AP McCoy any more," said friend and rival Ruby Walsh in the build-up to McCoy becoming the first jockey to be named BBC Sports Personality of the Year, in 2010. Teetotal McCoy's toll of injuries is sobering - he's broken both collarbones, shoulder blades, his lower and middle vertebrae, ribs, cheekbones, a leg, ankle, arm and wrist. He has punctured his lungs, chipped teeth and even dislocated his thumb. And each time he gets up again, driven by his unquenchable thirst for winners and to set landmarks that he will never see beaten. "He really is an iron man," said Martin Pipe, the retired 15-times champion trainer who employed him as stable jockey for nearly a decade. "I remember one race early on where the horse slipped up on the bend at Chepstow, AP fell and the whole field galloped over him. He really got flattened. "I was in the stands and ran down to see where they might have carried him off on the stretcher, and thought through who was going to ride later. We thought our horse Or Royal was a good thing later in the day. "Lo and behold, two races later, out came AP to ride Or Royal and duly won on it." Racing is a numbers game - odds, fractions, lengths, furlongs. And McCoy has redefined the mathematics, from novice hurdles at Hexham to the Grand National. When Stan Mellor rode his 1,000th winner over jumps in 1971, racing fans thought it might never be passed. Yet Mellor's record was subsequently broken by John Francome (1,138 wins), Peter Scudamore (1,678) and Richard Dunwoody (1,699). McCoy idolised Dunwoody as a child, but was just 28 when he passed his tally, seven years younger than his fellow Northern Irishman whose career was ended by injury at the age of 35. That was in 2002, the year he achieved perhaps his most staggering achievement - breaking the all-time record set by Sir Gordon Richards by racking up 289 victories in one season. That season he rode 189 winners just for Pipe. When Dunwoody won his last title in 1995, his tally for all trainers was 160. Richards was champion jockey 26 years running, and his record stood for 55 years. He rode on the flat, whereas McCoy has stretched his body and the pain barrier to achieve more success. Winners are what drives him, and fear - the fear of not being champion or losing his records. "He's ridden 1,154 winners for me alone, which is amazing, about 29% of his winners," added Pipe. "He certainly does encourage the horses to run for him. They understand him, he gets them in the right place at the right time, presents them correctly at a fence and goes at the right pace. "He is totally dedicated to racing, watches all the replays, enjoys it immensely and is always trying to win, whether it's in a small race or a big race, he gives every horse a Gold Cup ride." McCoy is tall for a jockey, at just over 5ft 10in, and has a punishing schedule of hot baths, saunas and precious little food as he keeps his weight down to about 10st 3lb. His natural weight would be 12st. The arrival of two children - daughter Eve, now six, and three-month-old Archie - coupled with the measured, intelligent support of wife Chanelle have mellowed him a little. But his sporting mantra still holds true: "I don't see the point of doing anything if you can't win." When asked several years ago if he enjoyed the atmosphere at the showpiece Cheltenham Festival, where 200,000 racegoers carouse throughout the week, McCoy replied: "I'm going to Cheltenham to ride winners, not run a social club." To ensure he made the festival in 2008, the jockey underwent kriotherapy treatment in an icy chamber to help his injuries heal. The temperature was set to -135C. McCoy asked for it to go lower and he shivered for three minutes at another record -149C. Even with more summer jump racing, and an increase in fixtures, McCoy's statistics send a chill through his rivals. No other jump jockey has ever ridden more than 3,000 winners, never mind 4,000. Richard Johnson, the man who has finished runner-up in the title race 15 times, is closest, with nearly 2,600 - but he bears no ill-feeling towards the man who keeps denying him the championship and the pair share a mutual respect. "AP has brought racing forward for jockeys - his fitness, determination and attitude is second to none," said Johnson, 36. "He's a credit to himself, but he's a great role model for the sport." McCoy's next birthday is in May. He will be 40 - a crossroads age for injury-prone jump jockeys. While he has media interests and a burgeoning career as a novelist - his first racing tale, Taking The Fall, featuring fictional jockey Duncan Claymore, came out on Thursday - it is the day when he stops and loses that winning thrill which may yet prove to be his toughest hurdle. "It's what I've always lived for and gives me the greatest high," McCoy said of the sport he adores. The rider, whose biggest drinking vice is six or seven sugars in a cup of tea on a busy racing afternoon, added: "I've never taken drink or drugs in my life, and don't know what it does for most people - but this is the nearest thing I've had to a drug. "Nothing has ever given me more satisfaction. I'm a realist, but it is the worst thing trying to contemplate not riding. It is an unbearable thought." </body>

      <title>Is there an 'angst canon' of books that teenagers read?</title>
      <description>Do teenagers still read the same rite of passage books?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24833198</url>

      <body>It's 100 years since the birth of Albert Camus. His book The Outsider is one of a select set of works that generations of disaffected teenagers have turned to as a rite of passage. The 1942 novel, also known as The Stranger, is about a French Algerian's seemingly irrational murder of an Arab and his subsequent indifference to his own execution. Central character Meursault is a man alienated from the society in which he lives. There's The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. Central character Holden is alienated from the society in which he lives. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a critique of totalitarian societies, but it's also about Winston Smith and his alienation from the society in which he lives. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World provides a dystopian vision of the world - through the eyes of a man alienated from the society in which he lives. Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar has a female protagonist whose mental illness is partly because of her alienation from a society which has fixed expectations of women. Then there's Joseph Heller's Catch-22 where central character Yossarian is rather alienated. And Franz Kafka's The Trial where… You get the picture. These books have formed a kind of canon of disaffected literature for disaffected teenagers. At the age of 17 and 18, readers are often searching for something with a bit of existential angst. And nothing taps into teenage angst quite like the idea of exceptionalism. The books in "the canon" can provide a feeling of uniqueness - a clandestine understanding of the world that nobody else quite gets. "'I can see through this, and Kafka can, but you can't'," says Guardian literary critic Nicholas Lezard of the feeling. "'Me and Kafka, we're buddies.'" A book like Catch-22 provides a prism for teenage readers, says Prof John Sutherland, an English literature professor at University College London. "It had sort of this ironic view of the adult world, where you're always trapped. [These books are] intellectual breakthrough stuff, a way of breaking out, a rite of passage." As well as looking for echoes of their disaffection, teenagers are also often attempting to look, well, a bit cool. The books are like a badge of honour. An actual badge, in Lezard's case. "I found a badge for sale that just had the word 'Outsider' on it," he says. "I wore that on my school blazer for a bit." The book itself might be placed conspicuously on show, with the titles poking out of school blazer pockets and tops of satchels. "[They're] what you might call 'accessory books'," says Sutherland. "The book was, as it were, to make a statement. It was particularly pronounced in 1960s, 70s and 80s adolescence. People used to sit around in coffee shops holding a copy of whatever the latest Samuel Beckett was and probably couldn't answer how many Ts there are in Beckett." Any teenager seen reading the book on public transport is sending out a message. "You know that if you sit on the Tube reading that [type of book], people will know you're an angst-ridden teenager," says historian Lisa Jardine, who has researched the reading preferences of men and women. Some may even detect a note of pretentiousness although most teenagers stop short of sporting a beret and pipe and disdainfully peering over a French-language copy of L'Etranger [The Outsider]. But calling the majority of teenagers pretentious is too harsh, says Jardine. "I don't like that word. I would call it 'statement reading'," she says. "They're exploring them, and they're struggling with them, and therefore it's more about statement than showing off. You swap [the fact] that you've read these books and then you know you've got a kindred spirit." Even if there is some posturing, it's not unhealthy, says Lezard, as it's partly about raising your game into adulthood - and some of the ideas do filter in. "So I don't regret any of this," he says. "Perhaps the badge." But the canon of teenage angst books is not the same for both sexes. "There's an absolutely dramatic difference between what girls and boys read at puberty," says Jardine. "Boys read angst books, so they read Catcher in the Rye, L'Etranger and books like that. Girls read expanding emotion and sensibility books. Jane Eyre, [Dodie Smith's] I Capture the Castle, the Brontes… books about difficult relationships. "It was absolutely staggering how little teenage angst books came up on the women's list." Men also tend to cling on to their teenage favourites later into life more than women, Jardine's research showed. But does the canon stay the same? And is there always a group of angsty teenagers to read it? "Nineteen Eighty-Four makes you re-evaluate society," says 17-year-old Enosh Ghimire, from Ealing, west London. "It's a common theme in many of the books - criticising society or evaluating what society is." The canon itself isn't stable. New books may be added, others fall by the wayside. A good movie adaptation can be an obstacle. Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - those reaching adolescence after these films came out had to be extra committed to read the books after watching them - or disciplined enough to read them first. Ghimire says he and many of his friends enjoy reading Game of Thrones and that many are reading the Hunger Games, both of which have popular TV or movie franchises to accompany them. Laura Hampson, 18, from Liverpool, says her friends don't read that much but "they've read The Perks of Being a Wallfower recently because of the film". Hampson is a fan of contemporary John Green titles Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. But she says her favourite book is David Nicholls's popular book One Day, pointing to its unusual time structure and relatable characters. "It didn't make out either character was without fault," she adds. "With some romance books the other character can sometimes be described as this perfect person, which most people can't relate to." Another obstacle to the cultish or cool feel of books in the canon is the way many of them have been absorbed into English literature syllabuses on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 30 years. Ghimire studies both Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four as part of his course, admitting that they're not books he'd normally read. "School opens [them] up," he says. "I wouldn't have known about Brave New World if it wasn't for school. School made me aware that there are other books outside of what I would normally read." But news and current affairs makes some of the books resonate further, he says, citing the Edward Snowden spying affair as making Nineteen Eighty-Four really click. "And Brave New World is going to be relevant for a long time because of technological advances," Ghimire says. And it's only with a sense of irony, or perhaps disappointment, that teenagers realise their mum's favourite book was also Nineteen Eighty-Four and their dad's was Catch-22. "The feeling of being awkward and unhappy at school is in fact perennial," says Sutherland. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <title>Bulmers left with hangover after advertising mishap</title>
      <description>Cider advert features famous teetotaller by mistake</description>

      <body>A drinks firm has apologised after using a picture of a teetotal clergyman in a cider advert. Celebrating heritage is good, but there can be pitfalls, writes Graham Fraser. Bulmers hoped to highlight its continued production in Hereford with a picture of Rev CH Bulmer, who provided his sons Percy and Fred with a loan to support the family business over 120 years ago. "We hope he'd be proud," the advert says. He won't be. The picture of the Victorian gent is not Mr Bulmer. It is Hugh Price Hughes, a prominent Methodist who spent his life helping alcoholics. Rev Val Reid is the minister at the Hinde Street Methodist Church, home to the West London Mission. The mission was founded by Hughes to help tackle Victorian social problems. "One of the things Hugh Price Hughes was interested in when he founded the West London Mission was his work with some of the poorest people," Reid says. "The abuse of alcohol was a huge problem then. It caused untold misery, additional poverty, and a strain on families. We were very concerned that his image was being used to promote cider." Reid found out about the mistake when one of the members of her congregation spotted it while flicking through last month's GQ magazine. The minister called Heineken, which owns Bulmers, but could not get past the receptionist. She made a complaint to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA). Heineken then got in touch. "They have been extraordinarily gracious in dealing with it," Reid says. "They have pulled all the ads straight away." Heineken said it "fully appreciated the distress caused" by using the wrong image. The error happened after the company's advertising agency could not find a picture of CH Bulmer and used one of the teetotal minister instead. Heineken has said it will visit the church and make a donation. The firm's penitence might have been appreciated by Hugh Price Hughes. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>Papers ponder pensions shake-up</description>

      <body>Many of the papers focus on government plans for a shake-up of pensions, with a proposed relaxing of the rules surrounding final-salary schemes. "Pensions face new blow from ministers," is the headline in the Daily Telegraph. The paper says private-sector workers could see their final-salary pensions "eaten away" by the rising cost of living after ministers proposed removing legal protections against inflation from "gold-plated" retirement funds. The Daily Mail says widows could lose their historic right to a pension under plans to halt the "terminal decline" of final-salary schemes. Pensions minister Steve Webb insists the controversial move could salvage final-salary pensions by making them affordable for bosses, the paper adds. The Mail says the changes will make such schemes cheaper for bosses - at the expense of workers whose benefits will be watered down dramatically. But the Daily Express predicts "bigger, better pensions for all" in what it describes as "the biggest shake-up of the pension industry in a generation". The Express says the announcement is designed to give ­millions of workers more control over their savings and more cash to spend when they retire. The Guardian says pressure is mounting on Home Secretary Theresa May over her handling of the case of terror suspect Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, who has been on the run for a week. The paper says her admission that his passport was not seized, correcting an earlier statement, raises speculation that he has left the UK. The Times believes the revelation that the fugitive posed a threat two years ago puts Mrs May at risk of further embarrassment. "She needs to get on top of this and fast", demands the Daily Star. The Daily Telegraph says there is a chance Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed could win damages while he is on the run - after it emerged he is trying to sue the government, claiming the UK was complicit in his alleged torture. "It is beyond our comprehension", declares the Sun - one minute he flees the law in a burka, the next he uses the law to fight for compensation. The Daily Mail agrees, calling the challenge an "affront to justice". The Financial Times exclaims that "life is tweet" for the founders of Twitter after the company was valued at $31.2bn on the stock market. The paper says shares in Twitter soared as investors bought into "this year's most anticipated technology floatation". The are plenty of pictures of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge who boarded a vintage London bus to visit poppy sellers at a Tube station. The Daily Telegraph says the couple chatted to volunteers at High Street Kensington after a five-minute journey from their home at Kensington Palace. The Daily Star says they were "instantly swamped by onlookers who swarmed to take snaps". Finally, the Sun tells its readers that Britain's favourite takeaway, fish and chips, is taking a battering with fish prices rising like never before and a hike in the cost of potatoes because of wet weather. According to the paper, haddock costs 60% more than it did a year ago and experts are warning that this could get worse when another catch reduction is made next year. To add to this, supplies of cod are "dwindling". </body>

      <body>Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's official website has been hacked by people claiming to be members of the hacking group Anonymous. The attack comes a day after Mr Lee said he would track down the group. He made the comments after a person claiming to be part of the group posted an online video in which he threatened to hack government websites. Singapore's internet and phone regulator said part of the website had been "compromised" late on Thursday. "The PMO main website is still working, and we are working to restore the page that has been compromised," the Infocomm Development Authority said in a statement. The hackers had posted an image of a Guy Fawkes mask - the symbol of the Anonymous group - on the PM's website with the words: "It's great to be Singaporean today." Under new rules, unveiled by the Media Development Authority earlier this year, sites "that report regularly on issues relating to Singapore and have significant reach among readers" require individual licences. The video, which was posted last month, had protested against the government's new rules for news websites. Earlier this week, Mr Lee said his government would "spare no effort to try and track down the culprits". "If we can find him, we will bring him to justice and he will be dealt with severely. You may think you're anonymous but we will make that extra effort to find out who you are," he added. Earlier this month, a hacker - dubbed The Messiah and claiming to be a part of Anonymous - hacked the website of Singapore's main paper, The Straits Times. He had left a message saying the paper's report on the video was misleading. According to reports, The Messiah also claimed responsibility for hacking the website of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council last week, the municipal branch of the prime minister's district. Hackers linked to Anonymous have defaced dozens of websites belonging to Australian businesses and Philippine government agencies during the past week. </body>

      <body>Electric car maker Tesla's Model S has suffered its third fire in five weeks. In the latest incident, which took place on Wednesday in Tennessee in the US, a fire broke out in a car after it hit debris on the road. Tesla said the fire did not start spontaneously but was the result of the accident. The previous two fires have also been related to accidents. The firm's shares fell more than 7% on Thursday, following a 14% fall on Wednesday triggered by weak earnings. The company reported that it made a net loss of $38m in the July-to-September period. Analysts said that while the incidents had been sparked by accidents, investors had been worried over any potential impact on the firm. "For a company with a stock price based as much or more on image than financials, those recurring headlines are highly damaging," said Karl Brauer, a senior analyst with Kelley Blue Book. Adam Jonas, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, added that the risk of a formal investigation by US safety regulators "could raise near-term concerns to a higher level in terms of cost, image and production disruption". Tesla's shares fell 7.5% to close at $139.7 on Thursday. In October, a Model S caught fire after the driver ran over what Tesla said was "an extremely large object". After the fire, officials at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration had said they found no evidence to indicate that it resulted from defects or violations of US safety standards The second incident took place in Mexico later in the month. According to reports a car caught fire after it drove through a roundabout, crashed through a concrete wall and hit a tree. Tesla said it is investigating the latest incident in Tennessee to find out what had sparked the fire. "Our team is on its way to Tennessee to learn more about what happened in the accident," Tesla spokeswoman Elizabeth Jarvis-Shean said in a statement. "We will provide more information when we're able to do so." The firm's chief executive, Elon Musk, has previously said that electric cars are safer compared to conventional cars. </body>

      <title>Instagram grapples with drug adverts</title>
      <description>Facebook blocks searches for some topics associated with photos used to publicise the illegal sale of drugs via Instagram but leaves others active.</description>

      <body>Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. The photo-themed social network took the measure after being asked to respond to an investigation by #BBCtrending - a new social media series. The journalists had uncovered many pictures and videos of narcotics posted alongside text advertising their sale. Instagram is owned by Facebook. The firm has a policy of acting on posts reported as being inappropriate, but it believes it would be impractical and invasive to search for such material. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comment, so we can take action. "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." Among Instagram's "report photo/video" choices is the option to identify suspected drug use. The BBC understands Facebook's staff aim to review posts flagged to either of its social networks within 48 hours. They also have the option of blocking terms classed as "bad hashtags" - ones that promote banned activities - if they are mentioned in the press or in user reports. The only content Facebook does actively search for is images of child abuse. Most of the drugs-related activity appears to be taking place in the US. "Just getting a few packs ready for tomorrow morning... Place your order today, it gets shipped out at 8AM tomorrow," read one post placed beneath an image of bags of marijuana. Another picture showed a variety of pills, adding: "$2 a pop for xans, $10 a pop for roxys." This refers to Xanax, a psychoactive anxiety treatment, and Roxicodone, an opiate used to treat pain. Both require prescriptions in the US and the UK, but are sometimes bought on the black market. Crystals of MDMA and other amphetamine-related substances were among other drugs advertised via photos and videos. In many cases the buyer and seller arranged to finalise their deals using WhatsApp or Kik - instant messaging apps in which they could keep messages private. Like Instagram, accounts can be set up on these services without revealing either party's true identity. Instagram is not the only social network on which drugs are advertised. The BBC has also seen instances of the practice in comments below some videos on Google's YouTube service. But while it is relatively common for the person who uploaded a drug-themed photo or video on Instagram to be the one advertising the sale of the substance, on YouTube the person posting the ad tends to do so below videos belonging to others. Like Facebook, Google relies on users reporting a problem before taking action. "We take user safety seriously and have guidelines that prohibit any content encouraging dangerous, illegal activities," said a spokeswoman for YouTube. "This includes content promoting the sale of drugs. YouTube's review teams respond to videos flagged for our attention around the clock, removing millions of videos each year that violate our policies." One drugs abuse researcher - who has advised the UN, World Health Organization and the UK government - said he was concerned by what he had seen. "I'm not particularly sophisticated on the internet, and it took me 10 seconds to see posts selling class-A drugs on Instagram," said Prof Neil McKeganey, founder of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research, in Glasgow. "Here is a public space being used to trade some of the most dangerous substances that we know are being abused. "I absolutely feel there is a responsibility to take proactive action. "It seems to me far too serious for those who own the companies that provide the public space through which this is occurring to simply say it's up to contributors to bring this to their attention." UK-based drugs treatment charity Addaction said it too wanted social media companies to act "swiftly and vigilantly", adding that it believed the companies could make a positive difference if they did. "Social media is a great way of reaching out to millions and millions of people," said spokesman Elliot Elam. "That's why we'd like to see providers of these sites work with organisations like ours, so they can find ways to engage with any users who may be struggling with drug or alcohol problems." Google and Facebook are not the only companies that rely on user reports to indentify potential drugs deals. Yahoo's blogging service Tumblr confirmed it had the same policy. "For legal reasons, we do not proactively monitor the site," said a spokeswoman. "We respond to reports of activity that is illegal or against our policies pursuant to those policies and relevant law." Although the BBC found photos of illegal drugs on Tumblr, searches for the terms that brought up associated adverts on Instagram did not appear to do so on Yahoo's service. This is not the first time Instagram's self-policing policies have been called into question. In August the Fusion.net blog suggested that the illegal psychedelics 2C-I and 2CB were also being advertised via the app. However it suggested that banning related hashtags would not solve the problem, saying "users would get more creative and choose other labels". More recently US senator Edward Markey wrote to the service's chief executive, Kevin Systrom, asking him to look into reports that unregulated gun sales were being conducted through the app. "Other companies that enable online sales have enacted commonsense protocols," he wrote. "I encourage Instagram to take similar steps and adopt safe business practices that curb the marketing and sale of guns." #BBCtrending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <title>Vodafone fails on 3G mobile coverage</title>
      <description>Ofcom names Vodafone as only operator that has failed to reach 90% of the population with its 3G mobile services.</description>

      <body>Mobile firm Vodafone has been rapped by regulator Ofcom for failure to meet its coverage obligations. When 3G mobile spectrum licences were awarded in 2000, they included an obligation to roll services out to 80% of the population. In 2010 this was increased to 90%. EE, Three and O2 are deemed to have successfully met this obligation. But Vodafone falls short by 1.4%. It has promised to rectify this by the end of 2013. It will involve rolling out 3G to more mobile masts than it had originally intended. "Ofcom is fully aware of our plans to ensure compliance by the end of this year," the firm said in a statement. "Our network investment stands at more than £900m this year alone and we remain on track to deliver indoor coverage across 2G, 3G and 4G to 98% of the population by 2015, two years ahead of the regulator's deadline," it added. Ofcom will monitor its progress and reassess its 3G coverage in January 2014. Mobile coverage is a huge bugbear for consumers and one that Ofcom is determined to prioritise. Recently it produced a report suggesting that mobile coverage on Britain's roads was poor. Next year it will report on the mobile coverage on the country's railways. Matthew Howett, an analyst with research firm Ovum thinks that it will be little hardship for Vodafone to comply. "I don't see it being very much of an issue for them to catch up and quite probably it will happen before the end of the year," Customers can take heart from the current 4G rollouts, he said. "4G coverage will be better and much more likely to be complied with given the spectrum at 800MHz travels further distances and penetrates buildings well." </body>

      <description>A US company unveils build-your-own modular toy robots that can drive, wiggle and react to the world around them.</description>

      <body>A US company has unveiled build-your-own toy robots that can drive, wiggle and react to the world around them. The modular system, called Moss, uses magnetic balls as joints and hinges, has no external wires, and works without the user having to write any computer code. By attaching a Bluetooth module, players can control the robots remotely using a smartphone or tablet. The system has been developed by Modular Robotics in Boulder, Colorado. The company launched the toys on crowdfunding website Kickstarter. But chief executive and design director Eric Schweikardt told the BBC: "We're already making Moss so we don't need the Kickstarter funding. But in 2013, it seems like the place where people look for cool new tech products." The final version of the robot kits would "begin shipping in January or February", he said. "We're at the very beginning of an exciting time for consumer robotics." Hod Lipson, professor of engineering at Cornell University, New York State, said: "Modular robotics have been around for decades, and we've always believed they could be cheap, robust and versatile. In practice, they've proved to be expensive and fragile. "Modular Robotics is one of the first companies putting in the effort to mass-produce these things." He believes such toys could help make robotics accessible to young children and interest them in engineering from a young age. Although he used to teach Mr Schweikardt, Prof Lipson stressed that he had no financial interest in the company. In October, scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed off cube-shaped robots that can flip, jump and assemble themselves into different shapes. The small robots, known as M-Blocks, have no external parts but can move using an internal flywheel mechanism and stick together using magnets. </body>

      <title>Dyson Award for wearable robotic arm</title>

      <body>A battery-powered robotic arm that boosts human strength has won the 2013 James Dyson award. The Titan Arm, designed by four mechanical engineering students from the University of Pennsylvania, could help people with back injuries rebuild and regain control of muscles. It can also be used by people to lift heavy objects as part of their work. The team, who spent eight months creating the exoskeleton, will share a prize of £30,000 ($48,000). "Titan Arm is obviously an ingenious design, but the team's use of modern, rapid - and relatively inexpensive - manufacturing techniques makes the project even more compelling," said Sir James Dyson. "We are ecstatic," team member Nick Parrotta told the BBC. "It was totally unexpected - just incredible." The team produced its prototype for £1,200, which they say is a 50th of the typical cost of similar exoskeletons currently on the market. "We wanted Titan Arm to be affordable, as exoskeletons are rarely covered by health insurance," said Mr Parrotta, 23, currently studying for a masters in mechanical engineering. "This informed our design decisions and the materials we used. Most structural components are machined from inexpensive aluminium." Academic and commercial interest in wearable robotics is growing according to Conor Walsh, Professor of of Mechanical and Biomedical Engineering at the Harvard School of Engineering and Applied Sciences. But costs will have to continue falling if robotics are to feature more often in daily life, he said. "Reducing cost will be critical for commercial systems, however the total cost is not just the cost of the hardware but also the added cost associated with research and development, quality assurance and regulatory compliance." The Titan arm incorporates a rigid back brace to maintain posture, a shoulder featuring rotational joints, and sensors that can track motion and relay data back to doctors for remote prognosis. It can augment human weight-lifting strength by 40lbs (18kg), say the inventors, while the batteries can last for up to eight hours, depending on intensity of usage and workload. The current prototype is operated by a separate joystick, but future versions may incorporate electromyography technology, said Mr Parrotta, which picks up electrical signals produced by muscle tissue, thus allowing users to operate such prosthetics almost without thinking. All of the inventors who took part in the competition used 3D-printing to develop and produce their prototypes much more cheaply than would have been possible before. "Prototyping technology, previously reserved only for companies with big research and development budgets, is enabling young inventors to develop sophisticated concepts at university," said Sir James. "They can revitalise industries on a small budget - it is a good time to be an inventor." The second prize went to a Japanese team who created Handie, a prosthetic hand with sensors that can read brain signals. A 3D-printed plastic cast for broken limbs, invented by a team from New Zealand, took the third prize. The James Dyson Foundation runs the annual award across 18 countries with the aim of encouraging problem-solving inventions. </body>

      <title>Twitter shares jump on market debut</title>
      <description>Shares in the micro-blogging site Twitter close at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26, after the firm's first day as public company.</description>

      <body>Shares in the micro-blogging site Twitter closed at $44.90, up more than 73% from their initial price of $26 each. That means after its first day as a public company, Twitter is now valued at a little over $31bn (£19bn). More than 13 million shares were traded once they became available an hour after the New York Stock Exchange opened. It is the biggest technology listing since Facebook in 2012. Twitter floated on the NYSE and not, as some initially expected, the technology-rich Nasdaq exchange, where the likes of Facebook are listed. It was a big win for the NYSE, which decorated its exterior with banners promoting the offering on Thursday. Twitter has more than 230 million users, but is yet to make a profit. Shares in newly-listed companies are often volatile on their first day of trading. Within minutes, Twitter's stock price soared more than 80% before closing just below its initial opening price of $45.10 per share. When Facebook launched on Nasdaq, its shares were priced initially at $38 each. The stock soared within hours of its debut to a high of $45. But its price later slumped. It only recovered those losses by 11 September 2013, when shares again touched $45. Its initial public offering (IPO) was also marred by technological glitches and delays. To prevent Twitter's stock sale from having a similar fate, the NYSE ran tests on 26 October using larger-than-normal share volumes. Twitter is selling 70 million shares, which will raise more than $1.82bn. The company, which invites users to send tweets in 140 characters or less, has 232 million active users. According to its IPO documents, these users send 500 million tweets a day. Twitter's financials have been under greater scrutiny since it announced its plan to float, especially given that the company is still loss-making. It lost $69m in the first six months of 2013, on revenues of $254m. About 85% of revenues come from advertising on its site, and more than 75% of Twitter users access the site from their mobile phone. Mary Jo White, head of US regulator the Securities and Exchange Commission, recently warned investors to be cautious of the metrics used by technology companies like Twitter, noting that investors have become overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of data. "In the absence of a clear description, it can be hard not to think that these big numbers will inevitably translate into big profits for the company," she said in a speech. "But the connection may not necessarily be there." Twitter's founders saw their paper wealth soar to $4bn in the wake of the stock surge early this morning, although boss Dick Costolo said that none of the founders would immediately be selling their shares. The company's co-founder Evan Williams has a 10% stake in Twitter, making him its biggest shareholder. That stake is now worth a little over $2bn. Jack Dorsey, another co-founder, also stands to make a fortune from the IPO. His 4% stake is worth more than a billion dollars. Another co-founder, Biz Stone, is thought to have made millions of dollars by selling share stakes over the last few years. Big fortunes aside, after the hooplah of the morning, it was very quickly was back to work: Twitter employee Melissa Daimler posted a photo of employees at their desk just hours after the NYSE bell was rung. </body>

      <body>Microsoft has confirmed it is in talks with the Spanish football club Real Madrid to acquire naming rights to its Bernabeu Stadium. The 85,454-seat venue is currently named after its former president Santiago Bernabeu. Speaking on Spanish television, the president of Microsoft in Spain said discussions were at an early stage. "They've raised... renaming the stadium and we're only talking about this possibility," said Maria Garana. Online reaction to the news included possible new names for the stadium. "At most the stadium will be called the Microsoft Estadio Santiago Bernabeu," said one forum member. "The Gates Ground?" was a suggestion on Twitter by @HuffPostUK, in a nod to the company's founder, Bill Gates. Others wondered whether Microsoft would use the opportunity to promote its products. "Will it be called the Surface and feature players like Cristiano RonalDOS?" tweeted @tomwarren from technology news website The Verge. The Surface is Microsoft's tablet computer and DOS was one of the company's former computer operating systems. The announcement was not well received by all fans of the club. "I'm a Real Madrid fan, I hate Microsoft forever if they touch anything related to Madrid," said Haidi Farnoud. If Microsoft are successful in obtaining the naming rights, they will join a group of several other companies whose names are linked to stadiums. In the English Premier League, the airline Emirates has a tie-in with Arsenal, while Etihad sponsors Manchester City's ground. The German club Bayern Munich play their home matches in the Allianz Arena after signing a 30-year deal with the financial services company. But not all stadium renaming deals have been successful. When Newcastle United changed the name of their ground from St James' Park to the Sports Direct Arena in November 2011, the local council refused to use the new name on official street signs. At the time, the council said the decision to change the name would "upset the overwhelming majority of fans". </body>

      <body>Driverless cars will be tested for the first time in a UK town after £1.5m was made available from the government. The "pods", which will travel at 12mph (19km/h), will ferry people around Milton Keynes on designated pathways. Twenty driver-operated vehicles will be running by 2015, but it is hoped 100 fully automated versions will be introduced by 2017, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said. Similar pods currently operate at Heathrow Airport. It forms part of a £75m government scheme to enable businesses to make and test low carbon technologies, which it says will keep the UK at the forefront of engine design and help to safeguard up to 30,000 jobs in engine production. The electric-powered pods can be booked via a smartphone app and will be able to accommodate two passengers. While travelling, they will use sensors to avoid obstacles. In the automated versions, passengers travelling to their selected destination will be able to browse the internet, check emails, read the newspaper and play games inside the pod. The cost of each journey has not yet been decided. If successful, they could be used in other towns and cities across the UK, the government said. Business Secretary Vince Cable said: "By 2050, very few - if any - new cars will be powered solely by the traditional internal combustion engines, so it is important that the UK car industry is at the cutting edge of low carbon technologies." Early collaborators on the project include the engineering firm Arup and the universities of Cambridge and Oxford. Google has been licensed to experiment with driverless vehicles in the US, claiming that in testing it logged more than 300,000 miles (482,803km) in its cars without an accident. </body>

      <body>Rivals Microsoft, Google and Facebook have joined forces to offers bounties to "friendly hackers" who can hunt down web bugs. The tech giants have put their differences aside in pursuit of a "safer internet". Dubbed Hackerone, the bug bounty programme offers cash rewards between $300 (£186) and $5,000 (£3,110) for discovering security holes. The size of the reward will be determined by a panel of employees. It may go higher if the discovery is deemed important enough. Anyone is eligible to enter the competition, except those from countries with which the US has trade restrictions, such as Cuba, Iran, North Korea and Syria. Children are also welcome to join in although they will need to claim their bounties from their parents. The bounties will be paid by Microsoft and Facebook with Google supplying a member of staff to sit on the panel. The team has suggested areas that people may want to look at. It includes some of the key pieces of software that make the web work as well as offering a category simply labelled "the internet", which comes with a minimum bounty of $5,000. Tech firms are stepping up efforts to battle hackers and ensure the internet is safer. Microsoft has its own independent bounty programme and it recently raised the prize fund to $100,000. The need for such bounty hunters was illustrated as Microsoft announced on the same day that a brand new security hole in Windows could allow criminals to get control of users computers via malware-injected image files. The flaw means that anyone opening a malware-filled TIFF image could find malicious code installed on their computer without them knowing. The bug is a so-called zero-day vulnerability, which means that it was not known about until real-life instances of attacks became apparent. </body>

      <title>Kenya gets e-centre to cut red tape</title>
      <description>Kenya's president launches a "one-stop shop" to access and pay for government services electronically in order to cut corruption and bureaucracy.</description>

      <body>Kenya's leader has launched a "one-stop shop" to access and pay for government services electronically in order to cut corruption and bureaucracy. President Uhuru Kenyatta said public inefficiency had bred corruption, wasted time and "cost billions". A pilot centre has been set up in the capital, Nairobi, where customers can access a range of self-service counters linked to government databases. Known as Huduma centres, they will be rolled out across the country. Huduma, which means "service" in Swahili, is part of a government plan to fully digitise government services. Kenya is one of Africa's most technologically advanced countries, with a widely used mobile phone money transfer service and a cluster of tech start-ups. But President Kenyatta said this had yet to reach government services: "For a long time Kenyans have been subjected to moving from place to place in search of services from the government," he said at the launch of the pilot centre. "Kenyans and visitors became accustomed to being frustrated numerous times in their quest for public service: 'Come tomorrow'; 'Go to this or that other office first'; 'Bring a copy of your identity card'; and so on. "Endless, static queues have been the order of the day, wasting countless hours. Public service became the epitome of inefficiency. This inefficiency bred corruption, initiating a cycle of vice which has tormented many and cost the country billions." The BBC's Odhiambo Joseph in Nairobi says dealing with Kenyan bureaucracy can indeed be a costly and time-wasting business. Our reporter says he took a whole day off work to order a replacement of his ID card. It involved reporting the loss at a police station, going to a district officer to have the loss certified, then going to the national ID office and queuing for forms. He then joined another queue to submit the forms and then had to wait to be called for finger-printing and queued again to have a photo taken. At most stages, he was asked for money and then there was at least a three-month wait until the card was ready, which involved queuing again to collect it, he says. Under the new system, our reporter should be able to report the loss and apply for a replacement ID card at the Huduma centre - and as the system is connected directly to a government database, there would be no need for finger-printing and photos as his records could be automatically accessed. In properly managed queues, the president said Kenyans would be able to access 18 services from 10 government agencies - from renewing a driving licence and applying for health insurance to registering a business and paying for parking. "I urge Kenyans to expect and demand the highest service standards. I also remind all public servants that rude, reluctant, slow, or negligent service is illegal," Mr Kenyatta said. It was also matter of urgency for all government departments to digitise and automate their records and procedures, he added. Our correspondent says that once Huduma is rolled out, people should be able to track their applications online or through their mobile phones and will also be able to use some services without going into a centre. </body>

      <title>Fire hits Internet Archive building</title>

      <body>The non-profit organisation behind the Internet Archive has made a plea for donations following a fire at its building in San Francisco. The group runs the popular Wayback Machine, an archive of 364 billion web pages, designed to show people what sites looked like in years gone by. No data was lost, a spokesman said, but the damage was estimated at $600,000 (£373,000). He said: "It is in difficult times like these that we turn to our community." On the group's blog, founder Brewster Kahle wrote: "This episode has reminded us that digitising and making copies are good strategies for both access and preservation. "We have copies of the data in the Internet Archive in multiple locations, so even if our main building had been involved in the fire we still would not have lost the amazing content we have all worked so hard to collect." However, the fire did cause the loss of some materials that were being prepared for digitisation - the full extent of which is still being assessed. The Internet Archive was founded in 1996 with the intent to store the world's digital content, such as web pages, music, moving images and e-books. In October last year, the group announced that it had stored more than 10 petabytes - 10 million gigabytes - of information. As well as the Wayback Machine, the group also runs other archiving schemes - such as TV Search and Borrow, a collection of US national news programmes that can be obtained, for free, on DVD. The Internet Archive system was praised recently for allowing access to US government websites that were knocked offline thanks to the federal government shut-down last month. Thanks to the fire, the scanning centre in San Francisco will need to be either heavily repaired or rebuilt, Mr Kahle said. In the meantime, as well as donations, the group is seeking help in setting up scanning operations in different locations. </body>

      <body>The mystery of why Google has moored two barges off the US coast appears to have been solved. The search giant has issued a statement saying it intends to use the structures as learning spaces for people to find out about new tech. The announcement follows feverish media speculation over the past fortnight about the company's plans. One popular theory had been that the vessels would be used as floating wave-powered data centres. Government inspectors had signed confidentiality agreements about the four-storey building in San Francisco Bay and another similar structure off Portland, Maine. "Google Barge... a floating data centre? A wild party boat? A barge housing the last remaining dinosaur?" a spokeswoman joked. "Sadly, none of the above. Although it's still early days and things may change, we're exploring using the barges as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology." </body>

      <body>The British computer scientist who created the world wide web has said encryption cracking by UK and US spy agencies is "appalling and foolish". Sir Tim Berners-Lee told the Guardian that the practice undermined efforts to fight cybercrime and cyberwarfare. He called for a "full and frank public debate" on internet surveillance. It comes as a parliamentary committee has quizzed the heads of the UK's spying agencies - GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 - together in public for the first time. Sir Tim said the system of checks and balances to oversee GCHQ and its US counterpart the National Security Agency (NSA) had failed. Details about intelligence work carried out by the agencies and reported in the Guardian have been leaked by US whistle-blower Edward Snowden, a former NSA contractor. Sir Tim said the agencies had weakened online security by cracking the encryption employed by internet users to protect their data privacy. He also said it was a betrayal of the technology industry. "Whistle-blowers, and responsible media outlets that work with them, play an important role in society," he said. "We need powerful agencies to combat criminal activity online - but any powerful agency needs checks and balances and, based on recent revelations, it seems the current system of checks and balances has failed," he said. Sir Tim said media coverage of the Snowden leaks "has been in the public interest and has uncovered many important issues which now need a full and frank public debate". Meanwhile a group of Conservative MPs has urged the Guardian to take responsibility for the security implications of reporting the information and "act accordingly". In their letter, 28 Tory MPs said publishing the leaks in such detail "runs the risk of compromising the vital work of the institutions, processes and people who protect the safety of this country". They asked the newspaper's editor, Alan Rusbridger, to discuss with the intelligence services the implications for national security that publication would have, and be explicit about any information they have released that could threaten the safety of intelligence services personnel. Highlighting security risks that might occur if information intended for journalists fell into the hands of terrorists or "hostile foreign powers", the MPs also urged the paper to be open with the government and security agencies about exactly what information it had shared, and with whom. "We are asking you to do no more than to share with our intelligence services, the very people who protect the freedoms which the Guardian champions, that which you have already shared freely with international bloggers and journalists who have no concept of the UK national interest," they said. Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC) has questioned GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban, MI5 director general Andrew Parker and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers. Mr Parker took over as head of the security service MI5 earlier this year. MI6 is charged with gathering intelligence and GCHQ with monitoring communications. Intelligence chiefs have given evidence to the committee in private for many years. The session was shown on the BBC News Channel, with a short time delay to prevent anything that might endanger national security or the safety of those working for the agencies being broadcast. The ISC, made up of senior MPs and peers, said the committee meeting was "a very significant step forward in terms of the openness and transparency of the agencies". </body>

      <title>Marketplace Silk Road 'back online'</title>
      <description>Reports suggest that the Silk Road, an anonymous marketplace for drugs that operated at the fringes of the web, is back online.</description>

      <body>Reports suggest that the Silk Road, the anonymous marketplace that traded in drugs and other illegal goods, is back online, in a new version. According to AllThingsVice, a website that monitors the so-called dark net, the new site is already selling a wide range of drugs. The first version of Silk Road was shut down by the FBI in October and its alleged administrator arrested. But those behind it always vowed to revive the site. The new administrator of the revived site has adopted the same handle as the previous operator - Dread Pirate Roberts. The FBI believe that arrested 29-year-old Ross Ulbricht was the mastermind behind the original site. Mr Ulbricht has denied all charges The twitter feed for Dread Pirate Roberts reads: "#SilkRoad has lift-off". According to AllThingsVice, the new homepage reads "This Hidden Site Has Risen Again", parodying the US Department of Justice notice, which read "the hidden site has been seized". Twitter was buzzing with talk of whether the new site was a genuine replacement or a scam. Others asked how long it would take before it was closed down by the FBI. According to Ken Westin, a researcher with security firm TripWire, the site looks genuine. "It appears to be run by the same folks that were running it before," he said. "They are not going to be able to kill it. It is going to be a game of cat and mouse with the FBI," he added. Etay Maor, a fraud prevention manager with security firm Trusteer, and an expert on the dark net, said it was anyone's guess how long it would last. "It could be 24 hours or it could be a year." But with the Silk Road banking over $1.3bn (£810m) in two years from taking a percentage of sales, he is not surprised that it may be back online. "It is big business and those behind it want to get it back up," he said. In the aftermath of the Silk Road shutdown, alternative dark net marketplaces saw huge increases in traffic. One, dubbed Project Black Flag, closed down shortly after launch, with the founder Metta Dread Pirate taking the Bitcoin currency accumulated on it with him. He wrote on the site's forum: "I am sorry for my actions, but with the funds I gathered from the site, I will be able to keep myself from being homeless for the next several months". But there were plenty more, said Mr Maor. "The Silk Road was the biggest and everyone knew it, but it is scary the amount of sites on the dark net. "From selling weapons to money collection for jihadist groups. You name it - the worse things you can think of, it's all there," he said. </body>

      <body>Google, the world's top search engine, has been ordered by a French court to remove links to images of ex-motorsport boss Max Mosley with prostitutes. Google said the ruling "should worry all those who defend freedom of expression on the internet". It intends to appeal, French media say. Mr Mosley successfully sued the UK's now-defunct News of the World after it ran a story in 2008 claiming he had organised an orgy with Nazi overtones. He won damages for breach of privacy. The News of the World secretly filmed the former president of motor sport's world governing body with five prostitutes and published a front-page story. He won £60,000 ($90,000) damages after a judge ruled that there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme and found that his privacy had been breached. Mr Mosley won a similar ruling in France in 2011 when a judge ordered the newspaper's owner News Corp to pay £32,000 ($48,000) in costs and damages because copies of the paper and the video were circulated across the Channel. Speaking in 2011, Mr Mosley told a UK inquiry into a phone-hacking scandal at News Corp that he was pursuing legal action against Google in Germany and France over the search results. Mr Mosley said Google had agreed to remove links to material from the story on a case-by-case basis. But he claimed that when he had asked the firm to re-programme its technology to ensure it did not show up at all in searches about him it had refused as "a matter of principle" even though it was "technically feasible". "I think you cannot underestimate that if someone puts a picture on the web that they shouldn't, that will go on forever unless action is taken," he said. "As soon as a search engine finds it is available to everybody and the thing you sued over and won over is republished again and again... Clearly that can be stopped and should be stopped in my opinion," Mr Mosley said at the time. </body>

      <body>A blogger who turned to crowdfunding website Indiegogo to raise money to tweet from the UK's phone-hacking trial has hit his target. Peter Jukes has raised more than £4,000 to pay "his living expenses" for the trial's duration. The trial of News of the World staff including ex-editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson has attracted huge media interest. Mr Jukes has followed the case for some years, including writing a book. He attended court in London to hear the prosecution's opening remarks and posted details of proceedings, expressing surprise that live tweeting was allowed for the rest of the trial. While he wanted to continue, he said on his blog that he would have to stop "for financial reasons". "I'm broke (mortgage-defaulting broke to be honest) and so will have to seek other work in the months ahead," he wrote. But following many requests to continue he decided to turn to crowdfunding to raise money to cover his basic costs. "Despite a bit of embarrassment, I'm going to put pride to the side and see if I can do that," he said on his Indiegogo page. A day later, Mr Jukes hit his target, with six days of funding left to run. He said the amount would allow him to continue covering the case until Christmas. The trial is expected to last for up to six months. There are eight defendants - some are charged with phone hacking or conspiracy to commit misconduct and others with perverting the course of justice. All the charges are denied. The judge, Justice Saunders, has already made clear his feelings about the importance of the trial, saying that the case puts UK justice on trial as well as the defendants. Mr Jukes has been following the case for online publication The Daily Beast and has also written a book The Fall of the House of Murdoch. </body>

      <description>Microsoft warns that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers.</description>

      <body>Microsoft has warned that hackers could exploit a "vulnerability" in its operating system to gain user rights to the affected computers. It said attackers could exploit this by requesting users to preview or open a specially crafted email or web content. Microsoft said it was "aware of targeted attacks" and was investigating. The issue affects Microsoft Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Microsoft Office 2003 - 2010, and Microsoft Lync. Recent versions of Microsoft Windows and Office are not affected by the issue - which centres on a graphics component. Details of which products are at risk are listed on the firm's site. Microsoft said it would take appropriate action to address the issue, which "may include providing a security update through our monthly release process or providing an out-of-cycle security update, depending on customer needs". In the meantime, it has advised customers to apply workarounds - a setting or configuration change that "does not correct the underlying issue but would help block known attack vectors before a security update is available". According to Microsoft, the flaw lies in the handling of the Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) image files by a graphics processing component in the affected software versions. In a blog post on the Microsoft Security Response Centre, Dustin Childs a communications manager, said any move by hackers "requires user interaction". He said that the attacks are disguised as an email requesting potential targets to open a specially crafted Word attachment. If the attachment is opened or previewed, it attempts to exploit the issue using a malformed graphics image embedded in the document. "An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user," Mr Childs said. Microsoft added that hackers could also exploit the issue via a web-based attack. "An attacker could host a specially crafted website that is designed to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user to view the website," it said. However, it added that an attacker would have "no way to force users to view the attacker-controlled content". "Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to take action, typically by getting them to click a link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message that takes users to the attacker's website." </body>

      <title>Concept car ditches steering wheel</title>
      <description>Toyota previews a concept car that lacks a steering wheel, instead suggesting drivers would control it by shifting their body weight.</description>

      <body>Toyota has suggested motorists of the future could ride about in a vehicle inspired by a horse. It has announced a concept car that drivers would control by shifting their body weight while standing, doing away with the need for a steering wheel. One analyst said the current design posed too many safety issues, but did point towards future developments. The FV2 vehicle will make its official debut at the Tokyo Motor Show in two weeks' time. Toyota suggested leaning forwards, backwards or to the side to determine the FV2's direction would be "intuitive", adding that voice and facial recognition sensors would bring up information to assist users in their journeys. Suggested destinations and other data would be shown on an augmented reality display presented on the windscreen, it said. The aim was to develop aspects of trust and understanding between the vehicle and the rider "similar to those a rider will have with a horse". "This is an imagination piece rather than something that will be seen in production in the next few years," a spokesman told the BBC. "But some of the technologies we're suggesting could be introduced further down the line - say in five to 10 years' time." Carmakers often release images and models of imagined futuristic vehicles to coincide with motor shows. Although they are sometimes little more than a publicity stunt, they can be valuable as a way of seeking early feedback and helping determine where research and development funds should be invested. It can still take a long time for successful ideas to come to fruition. For example, Toyota first showed off the idea of making a hybrid - combining both an internal combustion engine and an electrical propulsion system - in 1977 when it unveiled a special version of its Sports 800 GT at the Tokyo show. It was 20 years later that it released its first hybrid for sale to the public - the Prius - in Japan. Other examples of tech first seen in concept vehicles include panoramic glass roofs, now found in some Renault and Mercedes cars among others, and using touchscreen panels to do away with dashboard buttons, as is the case in Tesla's Model S. One expert said the Toyota's latest design was intended to address a problem worrying the industry at large. "Lots of carmakers are very frightened by the fact many young people can't afford a car and insurance, and the whole concept of a traditional motor vehicle doesn't really appeal to them," said Paul Newton from the consultants IHS Automotive. "I think in practical terms the FV2 won't see the light of day - if you are standing up and leaning to move it, my first thought would be, what if you hit something? The likelihood of it being licensed in today's safety-conscious environment is zero. "But concepts are the proving ground for lots of technologies that do come into mainstream production, and many things will happen in the next 25 years that will redefine what we've probably spent a good part of century looking at as the norm." Mitsubishi, Nissan, Suzuki and Honda are among the other firms who have announced they will be unveiling concept vehicles at the Tokyo Motor Show, which runs from 22 November to 1 December. </body>

      <title>Call of Duty faces frame-rate issues</title>
      <description>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game report problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title.</description>

      <body>Reviews of the latest Call of Duty video game have reported problems with the graphics on the PlayStation 4 edition of the title. Testers said that its frame rate dropped at several points during the game causing a stutter-effect. The PS4 version of CoD: Ghosts is the only console edition that renders its images in 1080p high definition. The Xbox One and Wii U versions create less processor-intensive 720p resolutions. Publisher Activision has not commented. Although the PS4 version of the game is already on sale, Sony's console itself will not be released until 15 November in North America and 29 November in Europe. That potentially gives Activision time to release a software patch if the issue can be fixed. Ghosts is the 10th first-person shooter game in the main CoD series. Its predecessor, Black Ops II, earned $1bn (£621m) in its first 15 days of release, making it the second fastest-selling game of all time after Grand Theft Auto 5. Earlier this week, the head of Activision's Infinity Ward studio - which developed the newest title - told the BBC that his team had made delivering smooth animations a priority. "One of the key pillars of Call of Duty has been 60 frames per second... and ensuring that was of utmost importance, and the resolutions that appear are geared around that," said Mark Rubin. Elsewhere he suggested that the different way the new consoles handled memory had contributed to a decision to support 1080p graphics on Sony's machine but not Microsoft's. However, some reviews have suggested the PS4 version does not maintain a consistent frame rate as desired. "The PlayStation 4 version... has noticeable technical issues, sometimes slowing to a crawl, particularly during set-piece moments with multiple effects," reported Joystiq. "Frame rate hitches happen throughout the campaign on PlayStation 4 and, in a series known for its Hollywood-inspired bombast, it detracted from the experience." Now Gamer added that it was particularly concerned about the issue occurring during the title's online multiplayer mode. "It's rare - it only happened once every few matches - but it is definitely present," it said. "It's not something we've seen in any Call of Duty multiplayer before, so it stood out as particularly odd and unfortunate, given the frame-rate stutter is significant enough to let targets escape to safety or see you killed during the general mayhem." The blog Gearnuke has gathered together other complaints of a similar nature. Although Activision has yet to provide a statement, Mr Rubin had previously acknowledged: "There's enormous amounts of work ahead of us in perfecting our game engines on both [Sony and Microsoft's] platforms." Sony has not commented on the subject. However, Microsoft has addressed the fact the Xbox One version of Ghosts renders graphics in half the resolution of the PS4, despite the fact both consoles support the 1080p format. "Once people have the chance to play the games and experience Xbox One for themselves, we believe they'll realise that great-looking visuals are only part of the experience," said a spokesman. "Launch is the first of many steps into the new console generation, and we fully expect our developers to continue to break new ground and surpass previous limitations in the years ahead." Reviews of the Xbox One version of Ghosts remain under embargo until 12 November. </body>

      <body>Near Field Communications (NFC) technology allows small amounts data to be exchanged when enabled devices are tapped or held closely together or one device is touched against an NFC tag. Although the technology can be found in many smartphones, credit cards and passports it has yet to become mainstream. But Singapore's size and willingness to embrace new technology might make it the perfect place to roll out a nationwide NFC network. Spencer Kelly finds out more.

      <description>Are the days of free-to-read net content numbered?</description>

      <body>Fortune writer Adam Lashinsky seemed stunned and bemused by the blowback from his readers. He had written about the 3G buyout of Heinz on the professional networking site LinkedIn, and added: "Fortune [where I work] published a longish preview of the article here. The full version is here, and you'll have to be a Fortune subscriber to read it. No apologies by the way. The kids say they can get everything they need to read for free on the internet. Sorry. It's not true." Readers erupted. The most "liked" comment, 319 up to the time of publishing, was this: "If your Fortune article is as empty of content as this LinkedIn article, I think I'll stick to the free sources. Please refrain from spam postings." Mr Lashinsky wrote a combative follow-up defending subscription. He was unapologetic. "As far as the readers of my post were concerned, I had committed the cardinal sin of social media, which was to link to an article for which they had to pay", he tells the BBC. "To paraphrase their response, how dare I tell them about something that was not available to them for free." So, are the battle lines being drawn between free and subscription? Tumbling ad revenues and circulation are hitting traditional newspapers hard, making some of them charge for content. "Advertising is weakening on newspaper sites and online sites because you can target the ads through Google and Facebook to individual people," says blogger Andrew Sullivan. He made the one-million-readers-a-month The Dish a standalone blog, taking it out of the Newsweek/Daily Beast site and charging readers $20 (£12.50) a year. "We media have to find another model that does not rely on advertising. It's not actually working financially in the long run," Mr Sullivan says. "Advertising-supported news was a glorious accident," adds Mr Lashinsky. "We need other revenue streams. Subscriptions are a good one." Many readers seem resistant to paying for online content. Some sites have designed metered models that recognise that. The New York Times brings down a pay curtain after 10 free articles a month. The Times, in the UK, makes the start of articles visible, and directs readers wanting to see more to pay to access the rest. The Wall Street Journal and Financial Times have a combination of pay, free and registration content. Some sites have promotions for free or reduced subscriptions, or bundles with other product and services offers. Into the picture has stepped Jeff Bezos, of Amazon, who brings to a historic title, the Washington Post, a dose of modern start-up and retail savvy. Computer science engineer Robert Cailliau is the often unheralded other half of the story of inventing the world wide web, alongside Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The web was initially a system to connect the world's universities, which did not have a simple way of accessing each other's remotely stored academic papers and documents. Mr Cailliau, a Belgian, is now retired from Cern (the European Organisation for Nuclear Research in Geneva) and lives in France. He says that the idea of "dealing with the value of information" has been around for 20 years. "It was impossible for someone to say, 'I worked very hard to put up this information to keep these articles up to date… I want you to pay me, say one cent every time you click on one of my pages.'" Mr Cailliau thinks that monthly subscriptions are too expensive and restrictive. He says the pay-as-you-go mobile phone model is a great one for online content. "When you send an SMS, you pay a small amount of money. Each individual action should be billed individually," he says. "My browser should pay you automatically a cent or two cents per page without me feeling it. I should not have to prepay a large amount of money." "Why re-invent? The telephone already does that. We already have a worldwide system that's capable of billing the customer for every move he makes." Tien Tzuo is chief executive of Zuora, a San Francisco subscription management company. Its clients include News International - parent company of the Times - and Fairfax, owners of some of the largest titles in Australia. "Two cents a view is one possible model, but not necessarily the best," he says. "Your wireless plan now has prepaid plans, post-paid plans, family plans, nights and weekend plans, unlimited plans, bundles. "And people actually do not like feeling metered, they don't like being on a phone call and feeling like they have to get off the phone." What does he think his fellow West Coast entrepreneur Mr Bezos brings to the newspaper business? "People forget that Amazon built warehouses and distribution centres - a bricks and mortars operation to go with the internet side," he answers. "For newspapers, some people still want the printed product on their commute on the bus or the train. "On weekends at the kitchen table, people like to spread out the Sunday papers, and take out their favourite section." Can online media survive without subscriptions? "No," says Mr Tzuo firmly. "For freemium models like Evernote and Dropbox, there's enormous value in the free product, but eventually you need customers to pay. That's the best economic foundation for your organisation. "The gravy train is over. There is no more advertising subsidies that can power newspapers." Digital platforms cost money to build, but we still get much of our online content for free. That may be changing, but the question of the most effective way of balancing reader browsing habits with businesses' need to be viable, is far from settled. </body>

      <body>It is nearly 12 years since Bram Cohen decided to create a faster way to share large files over the internet. His invention, the BitTorrent protocol, allows computers to download a single file from multiple sources simultaneously, and - at the same time - to upload the sections, as they become available, to others. It took a while for the technique to catch on, but it has become pirates' tool of choice to copy movies, music and other media. It also has legal uses. Mr Cohen is now the chief scientist at the San Francisco-based firm BitTorrrent. The company has teamed up with musicians including Madonna, Moby and the Pixies to help them share and sell content to fans via its Bundle product. It is also pitching its Sync service as a way to synchronise data between computers without sending the information to remote servers that could potentially be accessed by the NSA or other cyber-spies. The BBC's North America technology correspondent Richard Taylor met with Mr Cohen and asked him about his invention's legacy, and how having Asperger Syndrome had affected his work.

      <body>Instagram, the photo and video sharing network owned by Facebook, is usually associated with light-hearted 'selfie' photos, or amusing memes. But it also has a darker side, and has become a marketplace for a wide range of illicit goods. So long as you know the right hashtags to search. Thousands of pictures showing drugs on offer can be found on Instagram by searching keywords. In response to this investigation by #BBCTrending, Instagram has blocked searches for certain terms associated with the suspected illegal sale of drugs via its service. "Instagram has a clear set of rules about what is and isn't allowed on the site," a spokeswoman told the BBC. "We encourage people who come across illegal or inappropriate content to report it to us using the built-in reporting tools next to every photo, video or comments, so we can take action." "People can't buy things on Instagram, we are simply a place where people share photos and videos." BBC Trending is a hand-picked selection of stories trending on social media around the world.

      <title>Twitter: It's worth how much?!</title>
      <description>How do you value a company like Twitter?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24819238</url>

      <body>Twitter's much-anticipated launch on to the markets is fizzing with fanfare and debate over how - given that it has never made money - the microblogging site, priced at $26 per share, is officially worth more than $18bn (£11bn). The facts seem to contradict themselves. Twitter's growth is slow, and it shows no sign of making a profit - its losses for the third quarter of 2013 increased to $64.6m, from $21.6m a year earlier. And more than half of its total registered users don't even use it. But some analysts predict that in the months post-share sale, the seven-year-old company's worth will increase to $20bn and beyond. That would give Twitter a valuation of more than double the likes of global carmaker Fiat, with its very modest-sounding market capitalisation of 6.9bn euros ($9.3bn). But Twitter is not alone in its sector when it comes to big price tags, if not profits. Online "scrapbooking" website Pinterest was valued at $3.8bn in October after its latest round of investment, giving it the same value, in terms of market capitalisation, as the UK's second largest house-builder Barratt Homes. Yet while Barratt has reported a full-year pre-tax profit of £192m for 2012-13, Pinterest has never made any money. Its digital "pinboards" may be attracting users, there may be talk of advertisers paying for posts, but it has no revenue yet. So why do these social media companies have this value attached to them? Aswath Damodaran, a finance professor at New York University's Stern School of Business, told the BBC it was a bit like buying a house. "You look at what other people are paying for something a little bit like what you are buying," he said. "[But] you have to think about whether you are going to price [the company] or value it." Twitter, Mr Damodaran believes, is being priced by bankers and brokers - not valued - and that pricing is coming from comparing it to its peers. By this he means that value is something more complex and emotional, but that pricing is based on at-the-time comparisons. Most notably, with Facebook. "The big difference between Facebook and Twitter is that Facebook was making money [when it launched its IPO in 2012] and Twitter is losing money," said Mr Damodaran. Facebook had a billion active users when it launched its shares. While Twitter is growing its user base rapidly - up 39% over the past year to 500 million - only 232 million of these are active each month. According to a recent report by analysts Pew Internet, 72% of internet users in the US use social networking sites, but just 18% use Twitter. Plus, while users are invited to tweet their thoughts in 140 characters, many do not engage on the platform at all, leaving their registered accounts dormant. Others prefer to simply follow news feeds and favourite celebrities instead. This can cut the amount of time people spend on the site, and in turn the opportunities for advertisers to catch their attention. Facebook's IPO famously ran far from smoothly, and its shares quickly halved in price, before recovering slowly over the next two years. "Twitter is also entering a more crowded market than Facebook," said Mr Damodaran, "and there are many more queuing up to join." Therefore, he added, Twitter should be valued at about $10-15bn. He wrote recently that "at $20 billion, it is a moon shot". Chris Orndorff, who manages billions of dollars for clients at Los Angeles-based Western Asset Management, believes value is a lot to do with cash flow. "One of the best ways to value a company is to figure out the present value of the cash flows," he said. "For a more mature company, this is easier to do because they have a history of earnings, and generally reliable predictions about future earnings and cash flows. "Relatively new companies do not have the history." Therefore, he added, the stock was more likely to be volatile. "The susceptibility of social media companies to changes in consumer tastes also makes valuing those companies much more challenging," he said. Martha Lane Fox, co-founder of the travel website Lastminute.com, told the BBC she was confident Twitter could make money and hold its value. "Yes it is a scrabble for revenue," she said, but the company "has an astonishing amount of money in the bank". Advertising income from mobiles, rather than desktop computers, now accounts for over 70% of advertising revenue, and here, believes Ms Lane Fox and others, Twitter may be able to flourish. She also predicted "a huge number of interesting deals and partnerships" that could boost it further. A lot of the "value" or pricing of these companies depends on a future demand for services, as well as possible advertising streams. But, as past deals demonstrate - that future isn't always predictable. Famously, ITV bought the website Friends Reunited for £175m in 2005, but in 2009 Brightsolid paid ITV just £25m for the site. It had been superseded. Its "value" had been eroded. Its customers, the key to any company, had, in large numbers, moved on. Similar problems were encountered at one of the early social media pioneers, MySpace. In 2005 News Corp purchased MySpace for $580m. When it was sold in 2011, its price tag had fallen to a reported $35m. It too had been overtaken, and users abandoned its offering. But, for San Francisco-based CBS technology analyst Larry Magid, these cautionary tales make the newer clutch of technology companies stronger. "MySpace is a constant reminder that a high and mighty service can lose its lustre. However, the lessons of MySpace were not lost on Facebook, Twitter and services that followed," he said. "I think the difference [now] is the execution and the demographics. To succeed, Twitter needs a diversified audience that transcends a particular demographic. MySpace was focused on youth - a particularly fickle audience." Mr Damodaran said: "A lot of very valuable companies today - including Google - were once small, money-losing companies." And Mr Orndorff agreed: "The valuation is reasonable if the company can continue to grow its user base, generate cash flow from advertising, and successfully fend off the competition. If not, then it will be remembered - or forgotten - like many of the 1998-99 tech bubble companies, and generate plenty of tax losses for investors." </body>

      <body>Picture the scene: you're at home watching the latest concert by your favourite musician. The crowd is raving, the singer approaches them holding the microphone out and a few people climb past security onto the stage. But alas, stuck in front of your computer screen, you can't join them. Except now you can - if you're a fan of American musician Beck, that is. He is one of a few artists making interactive music videos requiring fan participation. Throughout his 20-year career the industry has seen many changes, including more people now watching music videos on YouTube than on MTV. Beck has made many memorable music videos, though he started out with limited means. "[For] my first video we had no money," he says. "I had a friend who had film in the freezer left over from film school and we used that one roll of film. "Every frame was precious." The video in question was for his hit song Loser, which went on to sell half a million copies and became one of the defining singles of the 1990s. "I was surprised when some of these videos actually got played," he continues about his early releases. "Most of them were just friends who were making them and editing them." Since then the 43-year-old has collaborated with acclaimed directors such as Spike Jonze and Michael Gondry on his music videos. Earlier this year he took this one step further, developing a 360 degree experience with director Chris Milk. In Hello Again viewers can join Beck onstage or stroll around among the 170 musicians as they play David Bowie's Sound and Vision. Viewers move around by turning on their computer's webcam and moving their heads in the direction they want to move in. For Beck, music videos can create a strong connection between bands and fans in the digital age. "I grew up in an era where the packaging was such a big part of how you related to the music," he says. The cover of Psychocandy, the first Jesus and Mary Chain album, which has a bold design and stark red, white and black colour scheme, had an especially strong influence on how he related to the band and came to understand them. "It gave me enough information, it opened up a whole idea about where this music is coming from and what it was." He believes music videos can fulfil this role in today's digital era where there is less emphasis on physical records. "I felt that they were album artwork come to life," he says about these videos. The Google Creative Lab's Aaron Koblin has directed several interactive music videos. The 31-year-old heads the data arts team and grew up in the era of big budget videos which played a large role in teen culture, but says the fan was passive. "When I used to watch music videos it was very much 'I am receiving the content which is helping me understand and create a picture of the musician's identity'," he says. "But it didn't necessarily make me feel all that much closer." He thinks interactive web-based videos enable a new way of creating that bond. He has worked with Arcade Fire on videos that require fans to interact with the band. "I hope we can create a deeper emotional experience which will then help bring a better connection," he says. Together with director Vincent Morisset, he aimed to do just that with the Just A Reflektor project, which uses the title track from Arcade Fire's latest album. Fans connect their smartphone to their webcam via a unique code on the video's site. By moving their smartphone around viewers can change the visual effects on the video, creating sprinkles of light and colour. They also can guide the protagonist on her journey and eventually join her. "Your phone and computer are actually talking to each other," Mr Koblin says. "The computer is observing and talking about the phone's location and movement and in doing that is able to construct and change the story based around the way the phone is being moved around." While videos are increasingly being viewed on the internet, interactive web-based ones are still rare. Just A Reflektor uses new code and tools, that were specifically created for the Google Chrome browser. "These things aren't that easy to make yet," Mr Koblin explains. Creating these new tools is currently the most expensive part of making these videos. "That's part of why when we create them we're releasing a lot of the code that we used and a lot of the tools that we created so we can encourage other people to get involved." Arcade Fire have tried the interactive experience before in another experiment for Google Chrome. The song We Used To Wait was used by Mr Koblin and Mr Milk to become the interactive experience The Wilderness Downtown, which uses Google Earth to bring a new dimension to the song. Viewers type in their home address and will see images of where they grew up within the video. Jordan Gauthier is an Arcade Fire fan and says their interactive videos have strengthened his relationship with the band. He grew up in the French suburban town of Rennes and says The Wilderness Downtown made him relate to the song in a new way by helping him recall his childhood memories. "It's like putting your own memories into the video," he says. "I thought that was amazing." Ultimately Beck thinks the web opens up numerous possibilities to interact with fans. "I think that's an infinite idea," he says. "That kind of idea is going to spread because the technology exists." He points to the success of crowdfunding in other fields and thinks more videos will source their ideas and materials from fans in the future. Mr Koblin and Mr Milk crowdsourced for The Johnny Cash Project, which features the song Ain't No Grave. Released after Cash's death, the interactive site pays tribute to him through a video made up of stills drawn by fans. Viewers can then select and watch the frames in different orders. As material is continuously being added to the project, every viewing is unique. Crowdsourcing can also build closer bonds between fans themselves, according to British director Ninian Doff. He crowdsourced images of fans dancing to make the video for Graham Coxon's What It'll Take. One hundred fans sent in videos from 28 countries, and Mr Doff cut up all the videos for the final piece. "It's a big jumble," he explains. "Sometimes it's one person's legs and another person's top half, or it's one person's legs, one person's body, one person's head. "It's like making a Frankenstein out of fans' bodies." And people managed to find themselves and each other through leaving comments about the video online. "One person commented saying, 'Oh that's me at 2 minutes 5 seconds'," Mr Doff says. "Then another person replied, 'I'm your legs at 2 minutes 5 seconds'. "They'd managed to meet over the internet through being connected in the video." </body>

      <body>No-one knows exactly who is behind them, but in towns, villages and cities right across the UK, "Spotted In" Facebook pages are springing up - offering a kind of local information, dating site, and lost and found service all rolled into one. From big cities and towns like Cardiff and Reading, to the small village of Grampound in Cornwall, these sites are increasingly popular. In many places, more than one in 10 people are following their local "Spotted In" site. Almost all have been set up within the past year. The posts are a dizzying splash of late night post-pub sprawls, people shopping in pyjamas, and information about firework displays - all rolled up in typically British humour. Popular posts on the Spotted in Andover site include a cat found in bin - who became known locally as "Bin Cat" or "Stealth Pussy" - and the "so bad it's good" local rapper video (which spurred its own parody). Lost pets, wallets and ID are more regular fare - as is online flirting. "There are lots of happy endings... We are still waiting for our first engagement and wedding. It will happen though!" Some Spotted sites deal with serious subjects too. Spotted in Ipswich - which has more than 13,000 likes - was the first to expose a local man who claimed to have terminal cancer as a fraud. Also hugely popular are sites like Spotted on a Bus, Spotted on the Train, and Spotted on the Road. Some Spotted sites have had problems with bullying and harassment and have closed down - the most successful ones operate strict house rules and are carefully moderated. "It's almost like a forum for the town," says the admin of Spotted in Chippenham - who admits that being privy to the Wiltshire town's most "juicy secrets" is one of the perks of running the site. "Just to hear people say 'Did you see that on Spotted last night' is brilliant. My mum often talks about it and so does most of Chippenham." Spotted in Chippenham - like other sites - though is run anonymously. Not even his mum knows. Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <body>Back in the 1970s, Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak, and the rest, if you like, is history. The two became firm friends and although Steve Jobs often gets the credit for Apple's success, it was Woz, as he's known, who was the brains behind the silicon. He spoke to the BBC's technology programme Click. Computers are on the verge of understanding human gestures and speech, but it has not yet been perfected. Wozniak says he often finds Android human speech recognition software is more accurate than Apple's Siri. "Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is. And very often usually I find out that Android does." Wozniak says this is due to Android's access to Google's search engine. "That is actually the future of intelligence probably for computers getting smarter and getting artificial intelligence. I wish to God that Apple and Google were partners in the future." But how likely would a partnership between the two companies be? "I don't know. If I were there, it would be pretty likely. I'm probably wrong, there's probably an awful lot I don't know about the business concerns and one thing you've got to remember is a company has always got to make money," says Wozniak. Encouraging openness and sharing information and methods would benefit everyone to develop the best technology, Wozniak says. "I believe you should have a world where you've got to license something at a fair price. There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone. I wish Apple would use them and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us," he says. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology, all our products would be better, we'd go further. I do wish they were more compatible." Wozniak believes more sharing between companies would lead to developments in bigger and better technology in wearable tech, like smartwatches and augmented reality glasses. "I want a full smartphone-like capability on my wrist. The trouble is the more I think about it, I don't want the small size. "We're just at the verge of having products that have foldability and flexibility," he says. "For about three or four years I've been talking about organic LED displays that could be theoretically printed on plastic, wrapped and folded," he says. "But think outside of the box. It could be on the inside of your arm and then when you flip your arm up it could actually flip open into your own hand." Despite his legacy, Wozniak is not seen as an Apple insider these days. But he is still beloved by many of the Mac faithful. "His comments aren't influential in any shape or form. He was one of the founders of Apple and walked away, so the fan boys love him. He is free to say anything he likes," says Stuart Miles, founder of technology news website Pocket-lint. "I don't think he has any insight or influence into the inner workings of how Apple works. But nonetheless he is a fascinating storyteller," he says.

      <title>NHS spends £700 insuring each birth</title>
      <description>The NHS spends nearly £700 on clinical negligence cover for every live birth in England, a report says.</description>

      <body>The NHS spends nearly £700 on clinical negligence cover for every live birth in England, a report says. The review by the National Audit Office said last year this cost nearly £500m - almost a fifth of all spending on maternity. Public Accounts Committee chairwoman Margaret Hodge said the figure was "absolutely scandalous". The Department of Health said the NHS is one of the safest places in the world to have a baby. Having a baby is the most common reason for admission to hospital in England. The number of births has increased by almost a quarter in the last decade, reaching nearly 700,000 live births. The public spending watchdog said maternity services were generally good for women and babies, but there was still a lot of scope for improvement. Its report highlighted "wide unexplained variations" between trusts in rates of complications such as readmissions, injuries and infections. Laura Blackwell, director of health value for money studies at the National Audit Office, told the BBC the number of maternity claims had risen significantly in recent years. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, she said: "There has been an increase in claims and we don't cover exactly why. It is the same across the NHS. "I think it's a complicated picture... further complicated by the fact it takes an average of four years for a claim to be settled... so it's quite hard to draw conclusions about the current state of care." The NAO also pointed to a shortage of midwives and consultants on labour wards. The report concluded that a further 2,300 midwives are required, though their distribution across England varies substantially. And although it said the level of consultant presence has improved, more than half of units are not meeting the standard recommended by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. The report noted that between April and September last year more than a quarter of maternity units were closed to admissions for at least half a day because demand outstripped capacity. Clinical negligence claims for maternity have risen by 80% in the last five years. The cost of cover last year was £482m, and the average payment per claim was £277,000. Figures from the NHS Litigation Authority released last year showed the health service in England paid out more than £3bn in compensation claims linked to maternity care between 2000 and 2010. Ms Hodge said: "I find it absolutely scandalous that one fifth of all funding for maternity services, equivalent to around £700 per birth, is spent on clinical negligence cover." She said the NAO report had shown an urgent need to improve maternity services. "The department needs to buck up and take responsibility for this. It needs to review its monitoring and reporting process to ensure that all relevant bodies can work effectively together to deliver maternity services that are value for money and fit for purpose." James (not his real name), a recipient of medical negligence money, told the Today programme the money had helped give his son a better quality of life. He and his wife did not claim for negligence until six months after the birth of their son, when they realised the costs involved in his care. Their son had been starved of oxygen during birth and now suffers from quadriplegic cerebral palsy, severe brain damage, visual impairment and epilepsy. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said the health service should always learn from any mistakes to improve patient care in the future. "The NHS remains one of the safest places in the world to have a baby, but on rare occasions care falls below acceptable standards and unsafe care should never be tolerated." He said the service was making progress. "This report shows that most women have good outcomes and positive experiences of maternity care. We know 84% of women now say they have good care, which has gone up from 75% six years ago. But we are determined to improve further." Royal College of Midwives chief executive Cathy Warwick said the report backed up what the college had been saying for a long time. "We are many thousands of midwives short of the number needed to deliver safe, high quality care. Births are at a 40-year high and other figures out this week show that this is set to continue. As the report states, births are also becoming increasingly complex putting even more demands on midwives and maternity services." Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists president Dr David Richmond said the NAO report raised valid concerns. "Although the UK is generally a safe place for women to give birth, we have known for some time that pressure on maternity services is growing in some areas, particularly inner city conurbations, placing stress on clinicians, managers and patients alike." </body>

      <title>Europe at 'polio risk' from Syria</title>
      <description>The outbreak of polio in Syria could lead to the disease re-emerging in Europe according to an article in the Lancet journal.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24854920</url>
      <date>1383877279</date>

      <body>Europe could be at risk from polio following a recent outbreak in Syria, infectious disease experts say. In the Lancet journal, two doctors in Germany say the cases in Syria - which had been free of wild poliovirus since 1999 - could endanger nearby regions. They say because only one in 200 people infected develops paralysis it could take a year of "silent transmission" before an outbreak is detected. In that time hundreds of individuals could be carrying the infection. Prof Martin Eichner, of the University of Tubingen and Stefan Brockmann, of Reutlingen Regional Public Health Office explain that most European countries use inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) rather than the live oral polio vaccine (OPV), because the latter can, in rare cases, lead to cases of acute flaccid paralysis, the main symptom of polio. Whilst IPV is highly effective at preventing polio disease, it does not give the same level of protection against the virus as the oral drops, so vaccination coverage needs to be very high. The doctors say that countries with low coverage such as Austria (83%) and Ukraine (74%) risk a sustained outbreak should the virus be introduced via refugees fleeing Syria. Polio vaccine coverage in the UK is at 95%. The doctors said Israel could also pose a potential polio threat. Prof Eichner told me: "Wild poliovirus has also been found in sewage in Israel and from samples taken from some symptom-free individuals since February 2013. Although there have been no cases of polio in Israel, tourists could risk bringing the infection to other countries." Dr Benjamin Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, said: "The Syrian outbreak puts Europe at risk because of the way we give vaccines. In parts of the world where it is still possible to catch a wild strain of poliovirus, children are usually vaccinated with a live but genetically weakened poliovirus which gives excellent protection but has a tiny risk of changing back to the more dangerous form. "However, in parts of the world where polio has been eradicated, like the UK, children are usually given a killed vaccine. It doesn't protect quite as well but it cannot mutate, so it protects reasonably well while preventing polio from being accidentally reintroduced to a country. He added: "Vaccination is never perfect, so despite being vaccinated, a small percentage of children in the UK would be at risk of contracting polio if they were exposed to the virus. Until the virus is completely extinct, it is essential that we continue to vaccinate our children." Most of the 22 cases of polio-like paralysis in Syria (10 of which have been confirmed as wild poliovirus type) are among children below the age of two who were unimmunised or who had not received all three doses of vaccine. The World Health Organization warned last month there was a high risk of polio spreading internationally because of the movement of refugees across the region and low immunisation rates in Syria. Prof Eichner said: "The WHO wants to get rid of polio completely and had got pretty close until recent outbreaks. The fact that most of those infected do not display symptoms but can still spread the disease makes it a very hard virus to get rid of as it is like fighting an invisible enemy." So far this year 322 cases of wild poliovirus have been confirmed, more than half of them in Somalia. </body>

      <title>A&amp;E staff pressures 'unsustainable'</title>
      <description>An independent report into the Accident and Emergency departments at the Royal Victoria and Mater Hospitals says the "overwhelming" pressures experienced by staff are not sustainable.</description>

      <body>The pressures faced by accident and emergency staff at Belfast's Royal Victoria and Mater Hospitals are unsustainable, an independent report has suggested. It follows an inspection carried out by the College of Emergency Medicine which has been leaked to the BBC. The report said issues faced by medics in the Belfast Trust are probably worse than anywhere else in the UK. The trust said it welcomed the report and an action plan was in place. The inspection, carried out in March, found that pressures on staff were at times "overwhelming , leading to poor clinical care and safety concerns." Inspectors point to the closure of the AandE unit at the City Hospital as a contributing factor, with a 30% increase in footfall. The report was delayed to allow further work to improve performance, however, despite good work it says the system remains under significant stress. Staff, it says, have made a valiant effort to maintain a safe system, but urgent action is now required. The inspectors describe the challenges as serious and say that they must be urgently addressed. The report says that safety needs to be embedded into the culture of the organisation and that senior managers need to show that change is occurring. Among its 10 recommendations are a dedicated emergency care team to deliver change and a review of the number of emergency consultants. It also says that the flow of patients and bed management planning should be regarded as a priority for further development by the trust. While the Belfast Health Trust might argue that some of these concerns have already been addressed, it is not the first time they have been raised by either inspectors or in fact, by members of the public. The emergency department has been in the spotlight repeatedly over the past two years. While waiting times have significantly improved - the real test will be the approaching winter when the environment and the staff are expected to be under severe pressure. This is not just a local problem. Emergency medicine is under severe pressure across the UK. While the number of elderly people is increasing, those who work at the coal face say that fact has not been matched by more money. </body>

      <title>US moves to ban trans fats in foods</title>
      <description>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to Americans' health.</description>

      <body>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to health. Trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils, are no longer "generally recognised as safe", said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulator said a ban could prevent 7,000 deaths and 20,000 heart attacks in the US each year. The FDA is opening a 60-day consultation period on the plan, which would gradually phase out trans fats. "While consumption of potentially harmful artificial trans fat has declined over the last two decades in the United States, current intake remains a significant public health concern," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a statement. "The FDA's action today is an important step toward protecting more Americans from the potential dangers of trans fat." If the agency's plan is successful, the heart-clogging oils would be considered food additives and could not be used in food unless officially approved. The ruling does not affect foods with naturally occurring trans fats, which are present in small amounts in certain meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats are used both in processed food and in restaurants as a way to improve the shelf life or flavour of foods. The fats are created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil, making it a solid. Nutritionists have long criticised their use, saying they contribute to heart disease more than saturated fat. Some companies have already phased out trans fats, prompted by new nutritional labels introduced in 2006 requiring it to be listed on food packaging. New York City and some other local governments have also banned it. But trans fats persist primarily in processed foods - including some microwave popcorns and frozen pizzas - and in restaurants that use the oils for frying. According to the FDA, trans fat intake among Americans declined from 4.6g per day in 2003 to around 1g per day in 2012. The American Heart Association said the FDA's proposal was a step forward in the battle against heart disease. "We commend the FDA for responding to the numerous concerns and evidence submitted over the years about the dangers of this industrially produced ingredient," said its chief executive, Nancy Brown. Outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the charge to ban trans fats in that city, said the FDA plan "deserves great credit". "The groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in New York City have become a model for the nation for one reason: they've worked," he said. </body>

      <title>City hospital in Savile allegation</title>
      <description>An allegation against Jimmy Savile relating to a Cardiff hospital has been investigated, health officials say.</description>

      <body>Health officials have investigated an allegation against Jimmy Savile relating to Cardiff Royal Infirmary. Cardiff and Vale University Health Board said an adult reported an incident from the early 1960s and it was working with police on the matter. The hospital is one of 13 under investigation in the UK following revelations about decades of abuse carried out by the former Radio 1 DJ. Final reports on the investigations are due in June 2014. The disclosure that Cardiff Royal Infirmary was involved in the inquiry was made in a written Parliamentary answer by health minister Norman Lamb. In a statement on Thursday night, the health board said: "Cardiff and Vale University Health Board can confirm that it has investigated one allegation from an adult relating to an alleged incident at Cardiff Royal Infirmary in the early 1960s. "The health board is working closely with South Wales Police and the Department of Health on the matter and is not in a position to comment further at this time." The question in Parliament had been tabled by former children's minister Tim Loughton MP. In his answer, Mr Lamb revealed there were 13 hospitals being investigated. Many of them had previously been identified, but this was the first time that a hospital in Wales had been named as being part of the inquiry. An investigation has also been commissioned by the Sue Ryder charity in relation to Wheatfields Hospice in Leeds. In October UK Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "It is vital that the final NHS investigation reports are thorough and complete, and reflect all the evidence about Jimmy Savile's pattern of offending. "The final reports of all the investigations will now aim to be completed by June 2014, with publication sooner if that is possible." The Welsh government has been asked to comment. Savile, who died in 2011 aged 84, is believed to have abused hundreds of victims during his 50-year career as a radio and TV personality. The Metropolitan Police launched a formal criminal investigation into Savile's alleged offences on 19 October 2012, called Operation Yewtree. In January, police and the NSPCC published a joint report - Giving Victims a Voice - on Savile's sexual offending. Key points included that the earliest recorded Savile offence was in 1955, with the most recent in 2009. His offending was most frequent during the period 1966-1976 when he was between 40 and 50 years old. Reports of offences at the BBC spanned more than 40 years, from 1965 to 2006. It said Savile's youngest victim was an eight-year-old boy. The oldest was 47, while most were aged 13-16. The report said 73% of his victims were under 18 and 82% were female. Offences were said to be mainly opportunistic sexual assaults, but there were others where an element of grooming or planning was said to have occurred. Victims' recorded crimes including 126 indecent acts and 34 rapes or similar offences. Cardiff Royal Infirmary opened in 1884 and closed as a district general hospital in 1999 but has since been used as a base for community health services. It is currently undergoing a £30m revamp. </body>

      <title>Autism detectable 'in first months'</title>
      <description>Signs of autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, early research suggests. US researchers analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism had shown diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - in the first few months of life. The findings, reported in Nature, raised hope for early interventions to tackle autism, said a UK expert. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the life-long disability, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

      <title>Prosthetic bladder 'controls urine'</title>
      <description>A device that could one day restore bladder function to patients with a severed spinal cord has been devised by UK researchers.</description>

      <body>A device that could one day restore bladder function to patients with a severed spinal cord has been devised by UK researchers and tested in animals. Nerve damage can leave no sense of when the bladder is full or control over when the contents are released. A study, published in Science Translational Medicine, showed a device to read the remaining nerves' signals could be used to control the organ. The charity Spinal Research said this was "impressive and important" work. The loss of bladder, bowel and sexual function after spinal cord injury is often rated by patients as having the biggest impact on quality of life. When the spinal cord is injured, signals passing up from the bladder cannot tell the brain when the bladder is full. Going the other way, signals from the brain cannot tell the bladder when it is time to go to the toilet. Researchers at the University of Cambridge have devised a solution that uses the nerves still around the bladder. Electrodes wrapped around bundles of nerves can interpret signals that say the bladder is full. Stimulating other sets of nerves can get the bladder to contract on demand and prevent it emptying of its own volition. One of the researchers, Dr Daniel Chew, told the BBC the device had worked on rats. "It is very effective. The feasibility studies are done, we're now limited by miniaturisation of the technology," he said. While the components that fit inside a rat could be converted for human use, the rest of the technology to process the information recorded currently needs a 6ft (2m) stack of equipment. This needs to shrunk down to a handheld device that can inform a patient when the bladder is full and a trigger button to contract the bladder. Dr Chew added: "This device is not the ultimate goal, the ultimate aim is to regenerate the spinal cord. What we're doing is restoring some function, not curing spinal cord injury." Dr Mark Bacon, the director of research at the charity Spinal Research, told the BBC: "Bladder dysfunction blights the life of many with spinal cord injuries and has a very major impact on their health and quality of life. "This is impressive and important work addressing one of the major limitations found with existing options for electrical stimulation to control bladder emptying, namely the need to surgically destroy the sensory fibres coming from the bladder. "Sparing and making use of sensory signals from a filling bladder adds a welcome degree of sophistication to elective voiding whilst retaining other functions normally lost such as erectile function - a distressing consequence of current methods." </body>

      <title>Car deaths 'down 40% in 50 years'</title>

      <body>The annual figures for people dying in car crashes in England and Wales have fallen by 40% in the past 50 years. A paper in the Emergency Medicine Journal says this is despite the rise in the number of drivers on the road. Men were more likely die than women in each year studied. Safety experts said measures including seat belts, speed cameras and curbs on drink driving had all helped cut deaths. About 1.3 million people die globally in crashes every year. Current trends suggest road accidents are expected to become the fifth leading cause of death by 2030. In this study, a team from the University of Nottingham looked at data on road deaths from the Office of National Statistics from 1960 to 2009. During that period, 102,196 people died as a direct result of a road traffic accident. In 1960, car crashes caused 1,647 deaths, but by 2009 the figure had fallen to 964 - a drop of 41%. Over that time, car ownership across the UK increased by about 3% every year. Men were more likely to die than women in every year studied. And those who from socially deprived backgrounds were consistently more likely to die in a car crash than those who were more affluent. There was a 70% fall in deaths among infants and children, from 66 in 1960 to 20 in 2009. Fatalities among the over-75s did rise - from 68 to 109 - but the researchers say this should be seen in the context of the increase in the number of drivers in this age group. Writing in the journal the researchers, led by Dr Andrew Fogarty, said factors such as the introduction of compulsory seat belts, drink driving curbs, child safety seats, and speed cameras, as well as the development of specialist trauma centres, had all helped to cut deaths. They added: "However, it is possible that while these interventions have resulted in a reduction in the absolute number of deaths from [road traffic accidents] in England and Wales, they have not modified the relative differential in age of death between sexes or socioeconomic groups in those who die after [a car crash]." Kevin Clinton, head of road safety at the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA), said: "The reductions in road deaths over the last five years or so have been particularly substantial, although this is partly due to the effects the economic downturn and periods of unusually poor weather on the level of driving. "However, as the BMJ report identifies, not everyone has benefited equally from these improvements in road safety, and people from less well off backgrounds suffer a disproportionate share of the risk. "The social factors that create this increased risk need to be tackled in a systematic way by organisations responsible for road safety. "Common approaches to improving the health, wellbeing and the safety of individuals and communities need to be identified, and closer ties and partnership working between road safety and health professionals should be developed at all levels of work." He added: "We also need to focus on specific groups of road users who face higher risks, especially cyclists, pedestrians, motorcyclists and young, novice drivers." </body>

      <title>Hospital 'dismissed bullying claims'</title>
      <description>Concerns about a "bullying culture" at a hospital under police investigation were raised more than a year ago.</description>

      <body>Concerns about a "bullying culture" at a hospital now under police investigation were raised more than a year ago, it is claimed. The Care Quality Commission has found "inaccuracies" in the cancer waiting time data at Colchester Hospital. The Royal College of Nursing says the hospital dismissed its concerns raised more than a year ago as "fantasy". The hospital said an investigation carried out by its own management in February 2012 was "not adequate". Staff told inspectors they were "pressured or bullied" to change data relating to patients and their treatment to make it seem people were being treated in line with national guidelines, the Care Quality Commission (CQC) said. The inspector said patients' lives may have been put at risk. Essex Police has been sent information by the CQC and is currently investigating whether there are grounds for a formal criminal investigation. Karen Webb, the regional director for the eastern region at the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said she raised concerns a year ago about the "bullying culture, the secrecy of the management culture" at Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust. She said RCN members who voiced these concerns were dismissed as "fantasists" and the board of the hospital tried to bully them into "shutting up". "I think there are a few things that smell rather unpleasant about Colchester General and the way that it is being led," Ms Webb said. "It is a great shame the trust chose not to listen to us over a year ago. Not only has it not acted on it, it behaved in the way that bullies classically behave. "Regularly, staff at Colchester Hospital have been told to keep quiet, to shut up, to not say anything about the directions that they've been given by senior managers to make sure that the hospital meets its target by massaging the data." Responding to her claims, Dr Gordon Coutts, the hospital's chief executive since July 2010, said there had been an investigation into the allegations in 2012 carried out by two members of the management team. This probe, he said, "was not adequate" and "did not go deep enough". Asked by BBC Essex if he would resign, Dr Coutts said: "My job is to keep improving this hospital, and I intend to continue to do so." Tim Roberts, the regional co-ordinator of Unison, said it first raised concerns last year. "Our members said they were being bullied, they were under undue pressure by middle and senior managers to falsify records, to put erroneous data on the cancer pathway database," he said. "The dates when a patient was referred to hospital - they were asked to change the dates. "The result was the trust would look like it kept to the cancer pathway deadline set by the Department of Health. "There's a high likelihood patients received treatment later because the wrong date was put on the database." Colchester MP Sir Bob Russell said he was "appalled" at the findings that showed staff falsified patient data. Sir Bob said what has happened "cannot be justified under any circumstances". "What level was this knowledge known? Senior people will have to answer for what they knew," said Sir Bob. "The consequences may well be that some people in senior positions may go or be asked to go." NHS England said it would now lead an incident management team of cancer specialists, to ensure the safety of cancer patients at the hospital. There will also be a review looking back to as far as 2010 to check whether any other patients had their notes changed or "inappropriately recorded". Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals, recommended Colchester Hospital University NHS Foundation Trust be put into special measures, which could lead to a new management team being installed or another trust put in charge. The hospital has set up a helpline for any patients or families who have concerns - 0800 028 2026. </body>

      <title>NHS deal on branded-medicine cost</title>

      <body>The government and pharmaceutical companies have agreed a five-year-deal to fix NHS spending on branded medicines across the UK. Last year, the NHS spent more than £12bn on branded drugs. Under the deal, NHS spending will remain flat for two years, followed by increases of less than 2% in the following three years. But the industry, which will absorb any costs above that limit, said it was a "tough deal" built on "myth". The Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS) is a voluntary scheme usually re-negotiated every five years This scheme applies to all licensed prescription medicines to which the manufacturer has applied a brand name. There had previously been an agreed price cut on the branded medicines sold to the NHS, but there was no limit on the overall cost. Typical annual growth in NHS spending has been about 5%. The new arrangements will be introduced from January 1 2014. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: "This agreement ensures NHS patients will receive the best and most advanced medicines in the world while managing the cost." But Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), said: "Whilst the deal allows us to move forward and focus on the key issue of ensuring NHS patients get access to the medicines they need, the government needs to recognise that medicines are an investment in patient care and not just a cost to be managed." ABPI president Deepak Khana added: "It should not be underestimated how tough this deal is for the industry. "The negotiations were built on a myth that medicines are expensive in the UK, which is not true. "The UK already spends amongst the lowest on medicines as a percentage of [gross domestic product] and has some of the lowest prices in Europe, yet UK patients still do not always get access to the most innovative medicines." </body>

      <body>Prime Minister David Cameron has dismissed Labour leader Ed Miliband's claim that NHS accident and emergency services in England are in "crisis". AandE targets had been "missed for 15 consecutive weeks", Mr Miliband said. The opposition leader accused Mr Cameron of breaking his pledge that "I refuse to go back to the days when people wait for hours in AandE." But Mr Cameron said waiting times in England had fallen and criticised Labour's handling of the NHS in Wales. At the prime minister's weekly Commons question session, Mr Miliband asked whether there would be a "crisis" in the NHS this winter. Having received his response, the Labour MP commented: "The whole country will have heard that the prime minister can't guarantee that there won't be a crisis this winter in our AandE departments. "That's because there already is a crisis. "That's what the president of the Royal College says," Mr Miliband continued, "he says this, 'There are almost daily instances in most AandE departments of patients facing extended trolley waits.' "The prime minister said two years ago, 'I refuse to go back to the days when people wait for hours in AandE.' "He's broken that promise, hasn't he?" The Mr Cameron was "complacent about the AandE crisis and clueless about what is actually happening in the NHS", Mr Milband added. "What the British people know is the NHS is heading into winter with fewer nurses, a lack of senior AandE doctors and a shortage of beds. "He promised he would protect the NHS but it's now clear the NHS isn't safe in his hands." But Mr Cameron said: "AandE in this country is treating 1.2 million more patients now than under Labour and let me give him one simple fact - today in our AandEs the average waiting time is 50 minutes. "When the shadow health secretary was sitting here as health secretary the average waiting time was over 70 minutes." He added: "There are more AandE consultants working in AandE than there were five years ago. "That is why we're meeting our targets in England and that is why Labour is missing its targets in Wales." Oversight of the NHS in Wales is devolved to the Welsh government, which is led by Labour. </body>

      <body>Depression is the second most common cause of disability worldwide after back pain, according to a review of research. The disease must be treated as a global public health priority, experts report in the journal PLOS Medicine. The study compared clinical depression with more than 200 other diseases and injuries as a cause of disability. Globally, only a small proportion of patients have access to treatment, the World Health Organization says. Depression was ranked at number two as a global cause of disability, but its impact varied in different countries and regions. For example, rates of major depression were highest in Afghanistan and lowest in Japan. In the UK, depression was ranked at number three in terms of years lived with a disability. Dr Alize Ferrari from the University of Queensland's School of Population Health led the study. "Depression is a big problem and we definitely need to pay more attention to it than we are now," she told BBC News. "There's still more work to be done in terms of awareness of the disease and also in coming up with successful ways of treating it. "The burden is different between countries, so it tends to be higher in low and middle income countries and lower in high income countries." Policy-makers had made an effort to bring depression to the forefront, but there was a lot more work to be done, she added. "There's lots of stigma we know associated with mental health," she explained. "What one person recognises as disabling might be different to another person and might be different across countries as well, there are lots of cultural implications and interpretations that come in place, which makes it all the more important to raise awareness of the size of the problem and also signs and how to detect it." The data - for the year 2010 - follows similar studies in 1990 and 2000 looking at the global burden of depression. Commenting on the study, Dr Daniel Chisholm, a health economist at the department for mental health and substance abuse at the World Health Organization said depression was a very disabling condition. "It's a big public health challenge and a big problem to be reckoned with but not enough is being done. "Around the world only a tiny proportion of people get any sort of treatment or diagnosis." The WHO recently launched a global mental health action plan to raise awareness among policy-makers. </body>

      <body>Women's lung muscles have to work harder than men's, making breathlessness more common after exercise, say scientists in Canada. Their study in the journal Experimental Physiology examined the activity of the diaphragm - the muscle that drives lung function. It had to work harder in women to compensate for smaller lungs, the research showed. The research was conducted at McGill University. Even with a man and a woman of equal size, the woman's lungs are smaller and their airways narrower. Breathlessness can occur after tough physical exercise or be a symptom of some illnesses such as bronchitis. "In both health and diseases, women are more likely to show signs of breathlessness after physical activity than men," said lead researcher Dr Dennis Jensen. The study compared 25 men and 25 women between the ages of 20 and 40, exercising on a bicycle. How deep and how fast they breathed at different levels of exercise were recorded. They also recorded the "drive to breathe", the electrical signals sent to the diaphragm to control its movement. Dr Jensen told the BBC: "Women have biologically smaller lungs and they have to activate respiratory muscles more to move a given amount of air." He said it was an "important insight into why women with emphysema and heart failure have worse breathing symptoms than men". Further studies will investigate the impact of obesity on breathlessness. </body>

      <title>Males more likely to be 'fat and 40'</title>
      <description>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests.</description>

      <body>Middle-aged British men are more likely than women to be overweight, but less likely to diet, research suggests. A study found more than two-thirds of men and around half of women in their early 40s were overweight or obese. However, the men were much less likely to realise they were carrying excess weight, say researchers at the University of London. The findings come from a study following 10,000 UK men and women born during one week in 1970. Those born in 1970 were considerably more likely to be overweight or obese in their early 40s than those born 12 years earlier, the researchers found. Men were far more likely than women to carry excess weight - with 45% classed as overweight and a further 23% obese compared with 29% and 20% of women. However, men were also much less likely than women to recognise they were overweight and attempt to slim down. Dr Alice Sullivan, of the Institute of Education at the University of London, told BBC News: "It's become so normalised for men to be overweight and they don't realise it - they're much less likely than women to realise their weight is unhealthy. "The worrying thing is that if men are overweight they are much less likely to take on health messages." Dr Sullivan and colleague Dr Matt Brown say carrying excess weight is seen as more socially acceptable for men than women. Overweight men are thus less likely to see this as a health problem and do something about it. Alerting men to their body mass index (BMI) status and the associated health risks should be a priority, they say. Commenting on the study, Christopher Allen, senior cardiac nurse at the British Heart Foundation, said: "Being overweight or obese increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. "Worryingly, this research highlights that men seem more inclined to ignore their expanding waistlines than women. "Whether you're a man or a woman, maintaining a healthy, balanced diet and keeping physically active can help you reduce your weight and your risk of cardiovascular disease. "For advice and support on how to do this speak to your GP or practice nurse." The research studied the BMI of almost 10,000 men and women in their early 40s being followed by the 1970 British Cohort Study, which is funded by the Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC). </body>

      <body>Patients, carers and relatives should be able to raise concerns over NHS care 24 hours a day, suggests Health Ombudsman Julie Mellor. In this week's Scrubbing Up - she explains how she hopes the Clwyd-Hart Review of hospital complaints will help tackle the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance by patients to complain and defensiveness of NHS organisations when addressing complaints and concerns. Too often we hear of patients not having the confidence to raise a concern on a hospital ward. They fear they won't be listened to or taken seriously. Even if they do complain, they can find NHS organisations defensive rather than open to feedback. One of the many people who we've spoken to about complaining said: "I feel like the little man against the system". We know this is an issue from the ward to the hospital board. The Ombudsman report 'NHS governance of complaints handling' found that only a fifth of NHS boards review learning from complaints and subsequently take action to improve services. People come to us once they've exhausted the local NHS complaints process. Our new approach from April this year means we have already accepted three times more complaints for investigation than we did last year and are sharing more learning from them with the NHS. We want hospitals to change their approach too and to welcome complaints and concerns raised by patients and carers at a local level as opportunities for improvement. We think it is critical that the "toxic cocktail" of reluctance to complain by patients coupled with defensiveness by NHS staff and organisations is tackled as a priority. We need to see a shift to a more open, collaborative and transparent culture within the NHS. This emphasis on local resolution can lead to opportunities to learn and improve services, providing a change in complaints handling from ward to board level. In order to deliver this change, there needs to be a focus on what patients need to help them raise a concern. The research and evidence we submitted to the Clwyd-Hart Review provides a powerful picture of what good complaint handling looks like. For patients and carers, advice on how to raise a concern should be accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week, so that every patient, carer and relative would have the opportunity to raise an issue in person, by email or over the phone. They would also receive support in doing so through local advocacy services. We have suggested the creation of one easily identifiable brand for this which could be used by all advocacy services in every local authority in England. For hospitals, boards should take the lead in bringing about a change in culture from defensiveness to one that welcomes and encourages feedback, where they use information from complaints to put things right. And commissioners and regulators need to hold NHS organisations to account with regard to listening to concerns and using information from them to improve services. Improving complaints handling will ensure that the same mistakes in patient care do not happen time and time again. It will also help to better the public's confidence in the NHS. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <body>Colchester General Hospital in Essex has been reported to the police, after staff said they were being pressured to change data about waiting times for cancer patients. Professor Sir Mike Richards, chief inspector of hospitals in England, stated it was shocking that lives may have been put at risk, for the sake of waiting time figures. Speaking to the Today programme, Christina McAnea, Unison's national secretary for health, said: "We think there should be a police investigation into what happened here, and we think there needs to be a complete change to the way, particularly junior members of staff, are spoken to and are listened to. "This is about people across every grade within the hospital, having a responsibility to speak out when things go wrong," she added. Bernard Jenkin, MP for Harwich and North Essex and chair of the Public Administration Select Committee, said: "The whole point about the leadership in our public services is that it can't just be about targets." He explained: "We mustn't replace values with targets, targets are not values. Targets do not tell you what is the right thing to do."

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly identified ligament may hold the key to common injuries</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24826323</url>

      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used macroscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the new ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and its role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <description>Key questions raised by patient record tampering at Colchester General</description>

      <body>Inspectors have found evidence of cancer records at an Essex hospital being tampered with, potentially putting patients at risk. A detailed report listing what was happening has been produced by the Care Quality Commission after inspectors went in at the end of August and start of September. The case has now been passed on to the police to investigate and the trust - Colchester General - faces being put into special measures and further investigations by the authorities in the NHS. In the weeks and months that come there are many questions that need to be answered. Inspectors looked at just over 60 cases and found the care of 22 may have been compromised. All but two of these case were chosen at random. That suggests this practice could have been pretty widespread. NHS England has set up a specialist team to look at the care given to patients since 2010. The hospital sees about 6,000 cancer patients a year, although the tampering with records seems so far to be centred around the specialities that deal with cancers such as kidney, bladder, prostate and colon. Senior management of the trust was alerted to what was happening early last year. An internal review was carried out by two members of the trust's executive team, but it did not result in the practice being stopped. The trust now concedes the investigation was not carried out properly- and has apologised for that. Colchester has yet to release details of that investigation or even said much about how it was carried out. But senior bosses - including the current chief executive Dr Gordon Coutts who has been in post since September 2010 - will have to explain themselves soon. The trust said a review of what went wrong with this investigation will be carried out. Colchester was one of 14 hospital trusts inspected as part of the Keogh Review into centres with high mortality rates. Eleven were subsequently put into special measures, but Colchester was one of three that escaped the sanction. A whistleblower alerted the Keogh team towards the end of the programme abut the tampering with records and this was passed on to the CQC for follow up. Those involved in the Keogh process say there was not sufficient concerns about the leadership of the trust to warrant it being placed in special measures. But the fact such a shocking practice was not dealt with by the Keogh inspection process - which has, after all, formed the basis of the new CQC hospital inspection regime that got under way in September - is a cause for concern. One of the elements of the Stafford Hospital scandal was that there was evidence out there about the poor care that patients were receiving. Patient surveys and complaints all pointed to the fact that something was not right. The problem was that the people with the power to act either ignored the warning signs or missed them. Did the same happen here? It is too early to tell. But what we do know is that the trust had a much higher than expected number of complaints being made against it, according to the CQC. Unions including Unison and the Royal College of Nursing also say they were trying to raise the alarm, but managers dismissed their concerns. Prof Sir Mike Richards, the chief inspector of hospitals, says he has never before heard of anything like this happening anywhere else. But what this case proves is that problems of this nature are very difficult to spot. The CQC inspection team only found evidence of tampering after being told exactly where to look. That raises the prospect that it could be going on undetected elsewhere. However, as the new hospital inspection regime is rolled out - by the end of 2015 all hospital trusts will have been visited - inspectors are bound to be keeping an eye out for this sort of practice. </body>

      <title>Will it be a bleak winter for the NHS?</title>
      <description>Is the NHS in for a tough ride in the coming months?</description>

      <body>The NHS knows it's coming, but the big question is whether it can do anything about it. Winter is traditionally the toughest time for the health service, particularly for AandE departments. Waiting times are often at their highest as hospitals struggle to cope with the rising number of patients coming through their doors with injury and illness. And it looks like this year will be the worst one for a long time. Last winter the NHS in England missed it's waiting time target from January to March as waits hit their longest for nearly a decade. Any hopes that this was a one-off blip have already been dismissed. The summer was the worst on record for many years. The major AandEs - known as type one - missed their four-hour waiting time target during the spring and summer. It prompted Labour to accused the government of overseeing the "first summer AandE crisis in living memory". Doctors are worried too. Bernadette Garrihy, of the College of Emergency Medicine, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday that staff were preparing for "what may be our worst winter yet". "We have got severe weather problems on the way, increased incidence of respiratory tract infections - things like winter vomiting bugs - we know that this puts our departments under huge pressure." But NHS England's medical director Prof Sir Bruce Keogh says plans are in place to help relieve the pressure. The government made an extra £250m available in the summer to help this winter. Another £250m will follow in a year's time. This is going direct to the worst-hit AandEs as well as surrounding community services, such as getting pharmacies to open longer. The idea is to give patients with less serious conditions more options other than AandE. Sir Bruce believes the early planning this year will help "decongest" some of the pressure points. But it is clear the problems are much more deep-routed than that. A quarter of visits to AandE lead to an emergency admission, suggesting many patients do in fact have a serious health issue that needs treating and, therefore, cannot be diverted to other parts of the health service. These have been rising since the late 1990s. A National Audit Office report published last week showed rates had risen by 47% in the past 15 years. Of these, a fifth are estimated to be avoidable - that is to say if the patient received better care in the first place the emergency would not have materialised. The frail elderly are the major cause of these admissions, presenting with problems such as urinary tract infections and pneumonia. This shows if better support was available in the community there could be a significant reduction in demands on AandE. However, tackling this requires long-term solutions - something NHS England has already recognised as it has set up a review of the whole system. The plans for the future are to be unveiled later this month, but it will be several years before they have an impact. For the time being, those on the front-line in the NHS are bracing themselves for the a long, hard slog in the coming months. </body>

      <description>My year with a lopsided grin and an eyelid on strike</description>

      <body>One year on, the BBC's Shanghai correspondent John Sudworth reports on his slow recovery from Bell's palsy, and frowns, almost symmetrically, at the lack of medical awareness about the condition. It may have taken a whole year, but the muscles on the left hand side of my face have been slowly drifting away from the picket line and getting themselves back to work. The strike, it seems, is over. My left eyebrow, the left side of my mouth and my left eyelid have all reported for duty again and I can now do two of the most glorious and underrated things a human can do - smile and blink. Shortly after the onset of my Bell's palsy, in October last year, I wrote about my decision to carry on working as a BBC TV reporter. The response was overwhelming, with many, many fellow sufferers writing to tell me about their experience coping with this facially disfiguring and deeply distressing condition. So, exactly 12 months on, by way of returning some of that generosity, this is my own story of recovery from an illness that was recently shown to be more common than previously thought and one that deserves far more medical attention than it gets. Bell's palsy sufferers usually find themselves becoming overnight - and unwitting - members of a very strange club. There are no warning signs and most people simply wake to find that they can't move half of their face. Although membership includes some pretty esteemed company, including the likes of George Clooney and Pierce Brosnan, it is not a club that anyone would choose to join. The paralysis can be shocking and, socially at least, very difficult to deal with. The hardest part for me, as well as the loss of my smile, was the inability to close my left eye. Bell's Palsy leaves sufferers with one eye stuck permanently wide open, unable even to blink, sometimes for months on end. Of course, the other, unaffected eye carries on as normal, merrily blinking away. So, for the record, my apologies to anyone who may have mistakenly thought I'd been winking at them for the past year or so. Except the barmaid in the Nag's Head. That was a wink. The eye issue certainly presented a thorny dilemma in my TV reporting. With my left eye stuck open, the choice was to either force my right eye to do the same - in manic two-eyed stare - or to blissfully wink away at BBC viewers. Move over Anne Robinson. Thankfully, as the above video shows, at some time between the six- and nine-month mark my left eyelid began to take instructions again. Bell's palsy is thought to be caused by the waking up of a dormant virus, often at times of stress and lowered immunity, much in the same way as the chickenpox virus causes shingles long after the initial illness has passed. The virus attacks one of the two facial nerves causing it to swell up and become constricted inside a bony passageway close to the ear. Signals then cease to be transmitted along it, paralysing one side of the face and rendering it expressionless. The only treatment that has been shown to have significant, measurable benefit is a course of steroids, but it must be started early, within 72 hours of the onset. These steroids reduce the swelling and lower the risk of permanent damage to the facial nerve. Remarkably, despite this clear evidence, a recent study has shown that many people (more than 40% in the UK) are still not getting the appropriate treatment. And the same study shows that Bell's palsy is more common than previously thought. The estimated incidence rate suggests that worldwide there are more than 7,000 new cases every day. One year ago, as I was becoming acquainted with my own facial paralysis, Charles Nduka, a consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon was setting up a new charity, Facial Palsy UK, which campaigns for better UK services for Bell's palsy and a range of related conditions. "The information available online about Bell's palsy at the moment is pretty appalling," he tells me. "And there is very poor data because there is not enough research." The illness, he believes, is all too often dismissed by the medical profession as a cosmetic issue because there are no ill effects apart from the paralysis. But Mr Nduka has seen the huge toll it can take. One patient, a professional musician, is no longer able to make the mouth movement needed to play the saxophone. Another, a receptionist, is simply unable to carry on in her job facing the public. In my previous article I mentioned one father permanently stripped of the confidence to appear in a family photograph. As one of the UK's leading experts in the treatment of the condition, Mr Nduka says that there are a few vital rules for doctors to follow when dealing with new cases: Of course the two questions any new Bell's palsy sufferer wants answered are, "Will I get better?" and "How long will it take?" The good news is that most people make a full recovery - many within a matter of weeks. Something like 70% of sufferers are back to normal within the space of a year. Getting the course of steroids in time will increase your chances of finding yourself in this happy category. Even without steroids, as my own case shows, most people get back to normal. The doctor I saw did not prescribe them and, by the time I realised how important they were, it was too late. I'm left wondering though whether my recovery might have been faster and fuller if I had been given them. I'll never know, because while steroids increase your chances of recovery they don't guarantee it. Estimates suggest that up to 30% of sufferers will be left with some residual effects more than a year after the onset. Five per cent of sufferers will experience after-effects that are severe and long lasting and, as a result, face the possibility of serious psychological distress. "It may be even harder nowadays," Mr Nduka says. "Face is everything - Facebook, Facetime, Skype. We live in a very image-conscious age." As for me, well I'm almost back to normal, as you can see from the video. I've been left with a tiny bit of asymmetry and a slightly weaker blink in my left eye. But recovery can continue for up to 18 months and the blink, being at the furthest extremity of the facial nerve, is often one of the last things to return. Anyway, I'm not complaining. So a big thank you to all those who wrote with words of encouragement, advice and good humour. You made a difficult 12 months so much more bearable. And on behalf of those whose recovery is still slower and less complete than they'd like, a humble appeal to medical science to do a bit more.

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>'I wish IVF had never been invented'</title>
      <description>Readers' stories about their experience</description>

      <body>A recent Magazine article by Lisa Jardine about the frequency with which In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) fails prompted readers to send in their own experiences. Five million babies have been born worldwide since 1978 thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, said Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), in the article. Fertility problems are estimated to affect one in six or one in seven couples in the UK - approximately 3.5 million people . Around 60,000 fertility treatments are performed in UK licensed clinics per year, with the live birth rate after IVF about a quarter, according to latest figures (2010) from the HFEA. The latest HFEA figures show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients under the age of the 35 will be successful. And the percentages decrease as women get older. Moreover, costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics Here are some of our readers' experiences with IVF. Karen, Blackpool: I knew about my fertility issue as a teen and met my husband when I was 31 and living and working in France. We put our names down on the waiting list as soon as we could at a French hospital. As I had contributed to the French social security system, we did not have to pay for the treatment. However, we did have to wait four years and I was therefore 36 when I started treatment, by which time we had returned to the UK. Four donor embryos and nothing but empty arms. This treatment gave us nothing but false hope when we could have spent energy on other things at an earlier stage. Of course, you only get to hear the success stories. Thurstan, Farnborough: My wife and I are going through our second round of IVF after the first one didn't work. We got through to the very end successfully, but the final result did not happen. We have to pay for our treatment, yet if we lived five miles in a different direction we would have got it free. We are told the success rate - for us its 25% to 30% - and you do live on hope. It is absolutely crushing to find out it has not worked and nobody can tell you why. Another £6,000 down the drain and you are left with a devastated feeling. Joanna, UK: At 27 I was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, and then with signs of premature ovarian failure - with a three-year time limit for most women with my condition. The technology used in assisted reproductive techniques is ever changing. If we were to wait even just a year, our chances of success would potentially increase. But waiting wasn't an option for us. Without a crystal ball to see how technology will evolve, you're forced into an emotional "now or never" scenario. The first thing we did as a couple was to decide how many IVF attempts to make. We agreed three - the first ending in yet another miscarriage, the second ending in no viable embryos. The second round was by far the worst outcome. Sitting in the clinic car park having arrived a little early, we got a phone call telling us not to come in for what was our embryo transfer appointment, because there was nothing to transfer. No viable embryo. We didn't have the energy to go in for the testing results, we just went home. Even now, putting that into words is horribly difficult and not without pain. Awash with the IVF drugs, which are hormonally altering, you just can't trust yourself to be at your best to make major life decisions. A game plan becomes a must. Had we not decided upon a game plan, I think we would have become addicted to IVF and its offering of hope. Having a game plan was also necessary to make sure we were on the same page. It's a strain within a marriage, but we were fortunate. It's really a gamble. We've all heard the expression "that floored me'". The phone call that caused my knees to buckle, I crumpled in a heap of disbelief and tearful, shaking joy. That's the hope people are offered. J, Cumbria: I'm just about to start my second round of IVF, and as mad as it sounds I wish it wasn't available/invented. It gives you hope and you pray you are one of the lucky ones. It feels like a raffle - how many tickets do you buy? Gemma, Liverpool: At 29, having found out my fallopian tubes were blocked, I started IVF treatment only for it to result in a failure. We had been trying for nearly three years with one miscarriage, devastation and despair to show for it. It felt like we had to wait ages for the referral to the fertility centre, but in reality it was only about three months as I'd had a confirmed diagnosis. We were informed that despite the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stating that we should have three rounds of IVF, our primary care trust only funded two cycles. Straight away you feel under incredible pressure for it to work, as IVF can cost thousands of pounds at a private clinic - there is the worry of where you'd find the money (I work in the NHS, while my husband is a teacher). Arranging time off work, the endless appointments and the invasive treatment you go through in the hope that you'll get your dreamed for family out of it. It gave us hope that despite there being an issue with me, we might be able to have a family. Out of nine eggs, we only got four which fertilised normally, one was transferred and one was frozen. After the dread of a two-week wait, we found out that it was unsuccessful. I'd joined a support group and other women were announcing that their treatment was successful. It's horrible feeling guilty that you wish it was you experiencing joy rather than that woman, although you're so pleased they've been successful. We waited for months for a follow-up appointment, and it was decided that an operation was now my best option, with the possibility of removing my tubes - a scary prospect for any woman, but even worse when you know that's it - take them away and you've literally got no chance of falling pregnant naturally. Add in an extra wait for my operation, and by the time it came round I was a wreck. Amazingly, I didn't have to have my tubes removed. We were given the further hope that we might be able to conceive naturally, but if it didn't occur within a few months, there was still the frozen embryo. Imagine our surprise when four weeks after my operation my period was late. I'm now six months pregnant, and I still can't believe it, it still feels like a dream. Donna, UK: Several years ago, my husband and I embarked on consultations and investigations, then minor operations and IVF to be able to conceive. We had no choice but to go privately - at 34, I was the wrong age to get IVF on the NHS in our area. Having had the initial consultations and started a course of treatment we were told that IVF was not going to help us at all. In a way, we were lucky as our clinic was honest with us and did not try to "sell" us any more treatments or give us false hope - we had only spent £500. This enabled us to cope with the "loss" more easily at this early stage. Our expectations were well managed by our clinic, although I understand that this is not always the case. We have since gone on to adopt a beautiful boy who has made our family complete for the past three and a half years. I hated the invasive nature of IVF, and although I am glad we tried, I would never turn back the clock. We are financially secure now and would have had no savings for a rainy day if we had continued down the route of IVF. Beth, Sussex: Having been through IVF four times, I can honestly say that all these clinics are after is your money. I've never received a phone call or letter after a failed cycle. In fact, the last clinic in Brighton thought we had miscarried but my twins are now six months old. The clinic made no effort to contact us. It's shocking. Zoe, Bristol: I honestly believe that undergoing fertility treatment was the worst decision I have ever made. Before, I couldn't get pregnant because of a combined problem - I have polycystic ovaries and my husband has blocked tubes as a direct result of surgery as a baby - it was nobody's fault. I was 27 when we were referred, 28 when we first went to the clinic and 34 when we had treatment on the NHS. I was offered treatment again when I was 37, but couldn't go through with it. We needed a sperm donor just at the time the law changed on donor anonymity and the sperm banks ran dry - literally! I wrote letters and lobbied everyone we could think of to get treatment (at the time, there was no sperm for private patients either) and after two years our clinic managed to secure us sperm for three attempts. They all failed and in hindsight, I now know they had very little chance of success - funding meant we were offered a less superior form of treatment (and consequently a lower success rate - just 8%) and the clinic also made mistakes with our treatment regime. The pressure to go private was huge because the clinic couldn't offer the treatment we needed - they felt that the best option for us was private treatment and made this clear from the outset, but we couldn't afford it. At the age of 37, I discovered the clinic was able to offer ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) on the NHS, but I no longer met the criteria as my BMI was above 30. (If we had been private patients, BMI wouldn't have mattered). We were told from the outset about the failure rate and at every subsequent appointment. At times it felt that the clinic was only focused on the failure rate. The clinic counsellor only wanted to talk about failure which I felt was inappropriate in the middle of a cycle, whereas if I mentioned failure to the nursing staff, they always brushed it under the carpet, encouraging positive thinking instead. There was a lot of conflicting information - they would be happy to ram failure rates down your throat, but if you mentioned it, it was often glossed over. In the reception area there was a photo board of babies belonging to all the families who had had successful treatment - there was no mention of the other side. They didn't like it if I cried either - I was once told off for "snivelling" by one of the doctors. Undergoing treatment was difficult, but coming to terms with failure was much harder. Now the failure to get pregnant was purely my fault, something the clinic was very keen to reinforce - I was overweight, I had produced too many eggs, I hadn't taken my drugs correctly. Three times my body was fooled into thinking I was pregnant when no baby existed and I feel like I've had multiple miscarriages, except I haven't. I feel like I've lost a child, except I haven't. When people ask me about the worst part of infertility, I tell them it's the silence - they take that to mean that nobody talks about it and that is partly true, but for me, it's the silence which comes from the isolation and the lost friends who have moved on and had children. I no longer have anything in common with my peers. My mother-in-law recently told me that life goes on and it does go on around me, but life also stops with me - where there are no children, there are no grandchildren, no-one to care in later life, no legacy and that is silence which terrifies me. Fred, Whitby: There are unacceptable variations in the success rates of IVF. Living in one of the few areas of the country where IVF is not available on the NHS, we were forced to go private. Our options ranged from 17% at one local hospital, to 65% in a London clinic. We weighed up the options and, despite the significant extra cost and inconvenience, went for the London clinic. We knew we could only afford one cycle, but also that we didn't want to keep trying and failing. The difference was that it was in their interests to make sure everything was perfect before going ahead with the various procedures, as their success rates are their best advertisement. The local hospitals seem happy to press ahead, even when the body is not in its best condition to accept an embryo. Happily, we now have an amazing little boy. Karen, Cambridge: My husband and I went through five unsuccessful IVF treatments, and I have to say this was the worst period of my life. The drugs make you feel awful, it costs a fortune and the grief is overwhelming. All this happens in private, too, trying to carry on like nothing is happening. I went through an NHS hospital and two private hospitals and found very little compassion - we were just on a conveyor belt. We were told it was just "unexplained", but if we had been advised on more tests that were available earlier, we may have found a solution before it was too late. No doubt you will receive lots of nasty comments from people saying we should just adopt, or there are too many people in the world anyway - these usually come from people who haven't had to face that decision themselves and haven't really thought about what it means. Changes in the adoption process are, however, starting to make that a more viable option. Diane, York: I think it's quite naive to think that couples who embark on IVF don't know the odds of success. By the time they reach the decision of going down this route, they already know their chances are low. My husband and I certainly did. However, for us, it was a case of not looking back in 30 to 40 years' time, and saying that we wished we had at least tried. We were lucky, we are very proud parents of a lovely little boy at our third attempt, and we don't regret what we went through for one moment.

      <title>MPs attack immigration removal rate</title>
      <description>MPs call for "effective action" against illegal immigration, saying only 1.5% of allegations result in a person being removed from the UK.</description>

      <body>Only 1.5% of reports alleging illegal immigration result in a person being removed from the UK, MPs have said. The Home Affairs Committee also said the now-defunct UK Border Agency had a backlog of 432,029 immigration and asylum cases when it was scrapped at the end of March. Its chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz, urged the coalition to take "effective action" to amend a "poor record". The government responded that it was "getting tough" on illegal immigration. The committee looked at the allegations database set up by the UKBA to follow up tip-offs by the public. It replaced a system where allegations and removals were held separately. It revealed that about 6% of claims had led to an investigation and 1.5% had resulted in removals. The committee said it was "extremely concerned about the number of allegations that are made to the Allegations Management System that are not investigated. "We recommend that all allegations are actioned and checked against national databases. It is incomprehensible that only 1.5 in 100 reports of illegal immigration result in someone being removed from the country." Mr Vaz said there was a "very poor record" on removals, which did "not give confidence to those who go out of their way to help the Home Office". The committee's report revealed that between its introduction on 30 September last year and 30 June this year, the database had received 48,660 allegations - about 178 a day. It said the rates of investigation and removal risked undermining confidence in the system and "could lead to reluctance to report such allegations if the public perceive that no action is being taken". The MPs recommended that those who made allegations of illegal immigration be told the outcome of investigations, in an effort to improve public confidence. After a series of damning reports, Home Secretary Theresa May abolished the UKBA and replaced it with UK Visas and Immigration and an Immigration Enforcement command, which were brought back under the control of ministers. "There are still over 430,000 cases languishing in the backlogs, enough to fill Wembley Stadium almost five times over," Mr Vaz went on. "As we have said on numerous occasions, the backlogs must be cleared as a matter of priority. Only then will the Home Office be able to tackle the deeper problems in the immigration system." Immigration minister Mark Harper said: "The UK Border Agency was a troubled organisation since its formation in 2008 and its performance was not good enough. That is why we split the agency and brought its work into the Home Office under two distinct directorates." He added: "Our newly created UK Visa and Immigration directorate is focused on delivering a high-volume, high-quality visa service, while Immigration Enforcement is getting tough on those who break our immigration laws." Mr Harper also said: "We are building an immigration system that the public can have confidence in. We have already reformed the immigration rules and net migration is down by a third since its peak in 2010." But Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said the committee's "damning report" shows that "for all the rhetoric Theresa May's Home Office is failing badly in tackling illegal immigration, backlogs of cases, and can only show progress by sleight of hand. "This out of touch government's response to real challenges has been to use taxpayers' money on ineffective and offensive gimmicks like the ad vans and 'go home' texts." He added: "The home secretary urgently needs to get a grip on the shambolic performance of the Home Office and make sure people are removed when they shouldn't be here, and sort out the backlogs that are increasing on her watch." Under plans announced by the Home office last month, landlords would be asked to check the immigration status of their tenants. There would also be new powers to check driving licence applicants' immigration status and a reduction in the number of grounds for appeal against deportation decisions from 17 to four. </body>

      <title>Commons debates EU referendum plans</title>
      <description>MPs are debating a Conservative MP's plans for a referendum to be held in 2017 on the UK's future membership of the European Union.</description>

      <body>MPs are debating plans for a referendum on the UK's future membership of the European Union. Tory MP James Wharton's bill is set to face blocking tactics by Labour opponents of it. The legislation, backed by the Conservative leadership but not the Liberal Democrats, calls for a referendum by the end of 2017. The MP said people should "have their say" but there was "little support" in his party for a poll before 2017. Mr Wharton's fellow Conservative, Adam Afriyie, has proposed an amendment calling for the referendum to happen in October next year instead - arguing that delaying a vote for four years will play into the hands of UKIP. Debate on Mr Wharton's bill is scheduled to take place between 09:30 to 14:30 GMT, the first of three days when it will be considered in detail by MPs. The BBC's political correspondent Chris Mason said he expected Labour MPs to filibuster in an effort to derail the bill, making long speeches about related issues in an effort to slow its progress. The prime minister's promise of a referendum by the end of 2017, following a renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Brussels, cannot be made law in the form of a coalition government bill because of Lib Dem opposition. Mr Wharton agreed to propose the legislation after he came top in a ballot of MPs and many Tories pushed for the referendum commitment to be made binding before the 2015 general election. MPs backed the principle of the EU Referendum bill by 304 to none after a debate in July, with Lib Dems and Labour boycotting the vote. The bill has now reached its "report stage", where amendments can be discussed in detail. More than 50 amendments have been tabled, including Mr Afriyie's and 36 alone by Labour's Mike Gapes. Mr Wharton said he hoped the bill would progress to its next stage and suggested the Conservatives were "absolutely united" over the need to consult the people about the UK's membership. "It is pretty hard in a democracy to deny people a choice on such a fundamental and important issue," he said. Asked about Mr Afriyie's amendment, he said: "One Conservative MP has said 'I think perhaps we should look at a different date' and what we have found in recent months is that there is not a lot of support for that." But Mr Afriyie said the prospect of a referendum in 2017 was "pie in the sky", given uncertainty over the result of the next election, and urged fellow MPs to "settle the question" now. "This can has been kicked down the road time and time again," he said. "We are in danger of doing this again today." Mr Afriyie, reported earlier this year to have leadership ambitions, denied that the amendment was a attempt to raise his profile. "It is not about me. It is about the British people having a say." Private members' bills have little chance of becoming law due to lack of parliamentary time, unless they are backed by the government. Tory MPs are under a "three line whip" to support the bill but few are actually expected to speak in Friday's debate amid concerns about opposition attempts to delay the bill's progress. Foreign Secretary William Hague has written to all Conservative MPs to urge them to make their remarks "short and pithy" and to consult Mr Wharton before putting themselves forward to speak. If it looks like the legislation will be "talked out" by opponents giving long speeches, Mr Wharton can ask for a "closure motion". If backed by a majority of MPs, numbering at least 100, this would allow the bill to be voted on as a whole. If the bill makes it through the Commons, it will go to the Lords for further discussion in the next few months. Ahead of the debate, the boss of car giant Nissan has warned the firm would reconsider its investment in the UK if it left the EU. Mr Wharton said he did not want to do anything to endanger one of the largest employers in the north east of England but the existing "uncertainty" about the UK's position in the EU needed to be addressed. "The EU is changing before our eyes. The way to resolve that is to have a proper debate and make a decision." </body>

      <body>Labour MP Shaun Woodward, who became a cabinet minister after defecting from the Conservatives, is to stand down at the next general election. Mr Woodward, who enjoyed a majority of more than 14,000 in St Helen's South and Whiston at the last election, switched to Labour in 1999. He eventually became Northern Ireland Secretary under Gordon Brown. Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Woodard had served with "great distinction" as an MP and minister. Mr Miliband said the MP's defection had taken "personal courage and political commitment" and that Labour would "be forever grateful to you". Writing to confirm his resignation, Mr Woodward said he would focus on human rights issues after leaving Parliament. Mr Woodward was elected as Tory MP for Witney in Oxfordshire in 1997, but quit the seat after one parliamentary term. While David Cameron succeeded him as Witney's Tory MP, Mr Woodward went on to win St Helen's South and Whiston, in Merseyside, one of Labour's strongholds, at the 2001 general election. Mr Woodward had fallen out with the Conservative leadership after backing the repeal of Clause 28, which banned councils and schools in England and Wales from intentionally promoting homosexuality. He is married to Sainsbury's heiress Camilla Sainsbury, daughter of the former Conservative MP Tim Sainsbury. A Cambridge graduate, Mr Woodward worked as a researcher and programme editor at the BBC and as head of press for the Conservatives before entering politics. </body>

      <title>MSPs endorse gay marriage bill</title>
      <description>Legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland is backed by the Holyrood committee looking into the proposals.</description>

      <body>Legislation to introduce same-sex marriage in Scotland has been backed by the Holyrood committee looking into the proposals. Most MSPs on the equal opportunities committee endorsed the Marriage and Civil Partnership Bill. But some members were either not convinced by the bill, or had concerns that it lacked adequate protections. The legislation still needs to go through three stages of voting at parliament before becoming law. Under the bill, religious bodies would opt in to perform same-sex marriage ceremonies. In addition, protection would also be offered to individual celebrants who felt it would go against their faith to carry out gay weddings. Same-sex couples in Scotland currently have the option to enter into civil partnerships, and the Holyrood government has insisted no part of the religious community would be forced to hold same-sex weddings in churches. Both the Church of Scotland and Roman Catholic Church are opposed to the proposals. The convener of the equal opportunities committee, Labour MSP Margaret McCulloch, said: "All of us on the committee recognise the validity, depth and sincerity of all views submitted to us on what has clearly been an emotive issue. "While the majority of our committee supports the general principles of this bill, we wholeheartedly support the right of all members of the Scottish Parliament to vote on the bill as a matter of conscience." The Bill will now go to the full parliament for consideration. Tom French, of the Equality Network charity, said backing the Bill would help remove discrimination from law. "With just days to go before the crucial stage-one vote on the equal marriage Bill, we urge MSPs to stand up for a fairer and more equal Scotland by giving this milestone legislation their full support," he said. "The large majority of people in Scotland believe it's time LGBT people had full equality, including the right to marry the person they love. This Bill will remove discrimination from the law and send out an important message about the kind of country we are." But campaign group Scotland for Marriage renewed its call for safeguards in the legislation to protect those opposed to it. A spokesman said: "The Scottish government's promise of sufficient safeguards have been shown to be hollow. "Real safeguards set out in amendments to the legislation are required to protect the rights and civil liberties of the majority of Scots who don't support this law. "No one who supports the law as it stands should be discriminated against. At home in the workplace and in schools, declaring a belief in traditional marriage should always be permitted and respected." In England and Wales, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act was passed into law in July. It is expected that the first gay and lesbian wedding ceremonies will take place by summer next year when the relevant statutory orders have been put in place. The act will allow religious organisations to "opt in" to offering weddings, with the Church of England and Church in Wales being banned in law from doing so. </body>

      <title>We defend freedom - UK spy chiefs</title>
      <description>Britain's security services defend "freedom and democracy", the head of MI5 tells MPs and peers in the first public grilling of the UK's top spies.</description>

      <body>Britain's security services defend - rather than undermine - freedom and democracy, the head of MI5 has said. Andrew Parker was being grilled alongside GCHQ director Sir Iain Lobban and MI6 chief Sir John Sawers in an unprecedented public hearing. He said 34 terror plots had been disrupted since the 7 July, 2005, attacks in London. The three men were quizzed on the work of their organisations by the Intelligence and Security Committee. The committee of MPs and peers normally takes evidence from the security chiefs in secret. But they have been under pressure to be more open after leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden revealed widespread spying by GCHQ and the US National Security Agency. MI6 chief Sir John Sawers warned the politicians that "our adversaries were rubbing their hands with glee, al Qaeda is lapping it up" in the wake of the Snowden revelations, adding: "The leaks from Snowden have been very damaging, they've put our operations at risk". GCHQ chief Sir Iain Lobban said activists in the Middle East and "closer to home" had been monitored discussing ways of switching away from communications they "now perceived as vulnerable". He also suggested the leaks could help paedophiles avoid detection, and said the success of intelligence operations required the country's enemies to be "unaware or uncertain" of methods. The Intelligence and Security Committee has already carried out a limited investigation into claims that GCHQ used the American National Security Agency's vast Prism programme, which gathers information from internet companies, to circumvent UK laws. Sir Iain was asked about these claims, but said his agency acted within the law and rejected the idea that they were involved in widespread snooping. He said: "We do not spend our time listening to the telephone calls or reading the emails of the majority. That would not be proportionate, that would not be legal, and we would not do it." He said the type of people employed by GCHQ were focused on combating terrorism and criminals and would "walk out" if they were asked to spy on innocent people. Andrew Parker, who handles agents within the UK, told the committee a total of 34 terror plots had been foiled since 2005 including "one or two" plots aimed at causing mass casualties. Most had been foiled as result of the intervention of the police and security services. He said MI5 was aware of "several thousand individuals in this country who I would describe as supporting violent extremism or are engaged in it" and "almost all" of the plots had involved some of "these people". He also warned about the growth of "terrorist tourism", where British nationals travel abroad for training before return to the UK to plot attacks, with the civil war in Syria currently proving a magnet for those seeking "jihadi" activity among groups linked to al Qaeda. Committee chairman Sir Malcolm Rifkind began the 90 minute hearing - televised with a two-minute time delay to prevent the inadvertent release of sensitive secrets - by saying it was a "very significant step forward in the transparency of our intelligence agencies". The agency chiefs explained what they saw their role as in a post-Cold War world and whether they were worth the £2bn in taxpayer money they receive each year. Mr Parker, who took over as head of MI5 earlier this year, said it was a "proportionate investment against the threats the country faces". Responding to concerns raised by leaks by ex-US security contractor Edward Snowden, he said: "The suggestion that what we do is somehow compromising freedom and democracy - of course we believe the opposite to be the case. "The work we do is addressing directly threats to this country, to our way of life and to the people who live here." MI6 chief Sir John Sawers was quizzed about why the security services had failed to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, 9/11 and the Arab Spring. He said that was not their job, telling the committee: "We acquire the secrets that other countries don't want us to know... we are not all-knowing specialists in what's going to happen next month or next year." Both he and Mr Parker stressed that they would never condone or be complicit in the torture of terror suspects, but Sir John admitted the security services were not adequately resourced or trained to cope with the scale of the terror threat in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. "It took us some time to adapt to the scale of the threat we faced," he told the committee, but they had "learned a huge amount over the last 12 years" and he was "satisfied" with the "rigorous compliance procedures now in place". Sir John, whose agency runs spying operations around the world, said agents in the field did not operate in isolation "like James Bond" and there was round-the-clock support available to them if they needed it. "We have a system to enable guidance to be issued from head office and if we don't feel clearly enough it falls one side of the line or the other - or the facts are just uncertain - then we will wake the foreign secretary up and ask him for a view one way or the other." Documents leaked to the Guardian newspaper by Mr Snowden - who is currently in Moscow where he has sought sanctuary from the US - revealed that agencies are able to tap into the internet communications of millions of ordinary citizens through GCHQ's Tempora programme. Although the committee cleared the agency of any wrongdoing in the 197 specific intelligence reports it looked at, it is now undertaking a wider inquiry into whether the laws governing surveillance are adequate for the internet age. Sir Tim Berners-Lee, who created the world wide web, has said encryption cracking by UK and US spy agencies is "appalling and foolish". Journalist Glenn Greenwald, who worked with Mr Snowden on stories for the Guardian about spying by the National Security Agency and GCHQ, said the Parliamentary system had, so far, failed to hold Britain's intelligence agencies to account. "There was a huge suspicion-less system of mass spying that the British people and the American people had no idea had been built in their name and with their money," he said. But he added: "I believe that that system can bring about real accountability if there's the political will." Sir David Ormand, former head of GCHQ, earlier defended the closeness of Britain's intelligence relationship with the US, telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We have the brains. They have the money. It's a collaboration that's worked very well." Asked why there had been such a fierce debate about the Communications Data Bill, dubbed the "snooper's charter" by critics, when GCHQ was already gathering large quantities of data covertly, he said the agency was "primarily a foreign intelligence agency" and the proposed legislation concerned British data. He added: "You shouldn't be looking to GCHQ to provide what can very much more cheaply and easily provided by the internet service providers. That requires legislation and Parliament got itself in a bit of a tangle over the details of that legislation." Sir David also dismissed Sir Tim Berners-Lee's criticisms, telling BBC Breakfast he thought the scientist was "probably exaggerating for effect, in order to get his point across and fire a shot across the bows of the intelligence agencies". </body>

      <description>David Cameron backs Iain Duncan Smith's handling of universal credit - after claims the work secretary tried to "lean on" MPs investigating welfare changes.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has backed Iain Duncan Smith's handling of universal credit after a report by MPs claimed the welfare shake-up had gone badly wrong. The public accounts committee said much of the £425m spent so far may have to be written-off due to poor management. Mr Duncan Smith denies claims he tried to "lean on" members of the committee to place the blame on his top official. Downing Street said the work and pensions secretary was "doing exactly the right thing" with the new scheme. In a damning report, the Commons Public Accounts Committee said management supervision of universal credit had been "alarmingly weak". The committee said the project - to merge six separate means-tested working age benefits into a single payment - had been beset by a string of problems and still faced considerable challenges if it was to achieve its long-term objectives. initial estimates suggest at least £140m, spent on IT systems which cannot be used, will have to be written off but the full losses could be much higher, and may take up much of the £425m spent on the project to April 2013, the report says. Labour sources on the committee have told BBC News there was a "concerted" effort by Conservative members to shift the blame from Mr Duncan Smith on to his permanent secretary Robert Devereux. One source said there had been a number of extra meetings and discussions over amendments "pointing the finger" at Mr Devereux but the committee eventually rejected the criticisms of the official in the final text of the report. These claims were categorically denied by Mr Duncan Smith's spokeswoman, who said: "Iain has not asked for anyone to be named in the report. He has publicly supported the Department for Work and Pensions permanent secretary throughout this whole process." The committee's Labour chairman Margaret Hodge said she had not been approached by Mr Duncan Smith, but sidestepped questions about whether she was aware of pressure being put on Conservative colleagues. Conservative MP Steve Barclay, a member of the committee, said he could "absolutely rebuff" the suggestion that Mr Duncan Smith had tried to influence the committee, which is meant to be non-partisan and impartial. David Cameron's official spokesman was asked several times to confirm that the prime minister was "confident" that universal credit would be delivered on time and on budget, but did not do so. Instead, he told reporters: "The department is working to the 2017 timetable. That is the timetable that the department continues to work to. That is the target the department is shooting for and we are going to continue to work towards it in the way we are." The spokesman was asked whether it would be proper for a secretary of state to approach members of a select committee ahead of the publication of a report in the way alleged of Mr Duncan Smith. He replied: "There are procedures that are in place for the relationship between departments and select committees and that is something the Department for Work and Pensions have been very clear about." Asked if the prime minister was "completely happy" with Mr Duncan Smith's handling of the implementation of universal credit, Mr Cameron's spokesman said: "He thinks that the secretary of state and the department are doing exactly the right thing in rolling this out in a progressive way and in a way that allows us to learn lessons as we go. "That is what is being done and he very much supports that." Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude, who has oversight of Universal Credit as part of his civil service reform role, said it was a "very hard-hitting" and "useful" report which highlighted wider problems in Whitehall: "We are not that good at financial control... but also project management has been deficient for a long time." Labour's shadow leader of the Commons, Angela Eagle, demanded an urgent statement from Mr Duncan Smith on the allegations that he tried to "lean on" members of the committee. Ms Eagle described the PAC report as "devastating" and told the Commons: "It seems that the blame game for this costly fiasco has already started. "This morning we learn of a wholly improper attempt to lean on members of an independent select committee of this House by Mr Duncan Smith and his parliamentary team to try to put the blame on the permanent secretary." Commons Leader Andrew Lansley said he had spoken to Mr Duncan Smith and saw no need for him to come to the Commons to explain himself. In its report, the select committee said control over suppliers in the Universal Credit had largely been absent, with multi-million pound orders sometimes being signed off by secretarial staff. From the outset of the project in 2011, it said, senior civil servants had "failed to grasp the enormity" of the task they had been set by ministers, did not monitor progress adequately and had not intervened when issues arose. A lack of day-to-day control meant that top officials only became aware of difficulties through "ad hoc reviews" and as problems mounted, those in charge of the scheme had become "isolated and defensive". Committee chairman Margaret Hodge said: "The failure to develop a comprehensive plan has led to extensive delay and the waste of a yet to be determined amount of public money. "Pressure to deliver a programme of this magnitude within such an ambitious timescale created a fortress culture where only good news was reported and problems were denied." Howard Shiplee, who took over the running of the project in May, has admitted mistakes were made but said real progress was now happening and much of the existing IT systems could be used. Responding to the committee's report, the Department for Work and Pensions said universal credit was a "vital" reform which would ultimately bring £38bn in benefits to society by helping people into work and reducing fraud. "This report doesn't take into account our new leadership team, or our progress on delivery," it said. "We have already taken comprehensive action including strengthening governance, supplier management and financial controls." It said it did not accept "the write-off figure quoted by the committee" and expected it to be substantially less. </body>

      <title>IT glitch 'would threaten 2015 poll'</title>
      <description>Some people could be denied a chance to vote at the next general election if a new computer system fails, ministers are warned.</description>

      <body>Some people could be denied a chance to vote at the next general election if a new computer system fails, ministers have been warned. The Association of Electoral Administrators (AEA) says a last minute computer glitch could see electors disenfranchised. The organisation raised the concerns in a research paper. The government said it would take the AEA's warning seriously but proceed as planned. The AEA, which represents more than 1,600 election administrators in town halls across the UK, said its members were not as confident as they should be about plans to register people to vote as individuals, rather than by households, in time for the 2015 poll. It said a survey of administrators in London had found an "overwhelming" number of them were not confident that the new system would work. The AEA report said there was "real concern about the potential consequences" of an IT failure. It said a failure from eleven days before polling day could result in electors being disenfranchised. AEA chief executive John Turner said that in the event of a problem people trying to get on the electoral register for the first time would be worst affected. He said: "Our concerns relate to that very short timescale before any election, minus 11 as its known, and the fact that if the IT systems that have been put in place for IER (Individual Electoral Registration) were to fail then it could be the question of a considerable number of people not being on the register and therefore unable to vote at the general election." He added: "At the 2010 general election there were significant numbers of applications to register largely as the result of the prime ministerial debates on television. "Where we will be in 2015 is an absolute reliance on IT on a national basis that has not been the case before so it's untried and untested." The general view of AEA members was, according to its paper, that they would deliver the plans, despite "considerable challenges". But if those risks were not fully addressed its view could change. Individual registration, which is meant to tackle electoral fraud and make the register more accurate, is due to take place in England, Scotland and Wales in time for the 2015 general election. It already exists in Northern Ireland. The details of electors registering to vote will be checked against DWP records using an IT service provided by the Cabinet Office. The AEA also expressed concern about the timescale for training staff. Last month, the Electoral Commission said the government could go ahead as planned with individual registration despite some remaining risks. It made the same point to MPs at a hearing earlier in Thursday. A recent test of the software found the records of almost 80% of electors already on the electoral roll could be automatically confirmed using the DWP database. A Cabinet Office spokesman said: "We are pleased the Association of Electoral Administrators agrees with the Electoral Commission's assessment that there is no reason not to proceed with the move to Individual Electoral Registration. "The AEA is clear that we should continue and that local administrators are preparing for the change - but we will take this feedback seriously and address it as we proceed. A lot of testing on the IT has been completed very successfully and we are on track. There's still more work to do - but before the new system comes in it will be tested and have any issues ironed out. "Our plans are on schedule as we prepare to bring in this new way of registering to vote by Summer 2014. " </body>

      <title>Clegg takes aim at 'sneering' Paxman</title>
      <description>Deputy PM Nick Clegg criticises BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman for spending "all his time sneering at politics" when he "lives off politics".</description>

      <body>Nick Clegg has criticised Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman's "sneering" attitude towards politicians. The deputy PM said the presenter made a living off politics but treated all politicians as "rogues and charlatans". His comments follow Paxman's admission that he did not vote at a recent election because he had found the parties "unappetising". The presenter also called the Lib Dem tuition fees U-turn "the most blatant lie in recent political history". Mr Clegg conceded politics was imperfect but asserted that "of course you should vote". The Lib Dem leader, appearing on his regular LBC radio phone-in, said that not voting in elections was a total "abdication of responsibility". On Newsnight last month, presenter Jeremy Paxman berated comedian Russell Brand, who has urged revolution and non-participation in elections, for not bothering to vote. But Paxman later admitted he did not vote in a recent election "because I thought the choice so unappetising". Mr Clegg said: "Here is a guy who gets paid a million pounds, thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers. He lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics. "We know that politics is not perfect, but at the end of the day it is the way that we decide how you pay your taxes, how we support our hospitals, our schools, whether we are going to war or not, how we deal with climate change." He continued: "Of course it's sometimes unedifying but this idea that you can sneer at the whole thing, dismiss everybody as somehow being rogues and charlatans and say, 'Well, therefore I'm going to wash my hands of the whole thing,' I think is a total abdication of responsibility. "I just have this old-fashioned view, if you want to improve something get stuck in and get your hands dirty and change it. "Don't somehow pretend you can turn your back on it." In the Newsnight interview with Paxman, Brand argued he had never voted because of "absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". At the time, Paxman responded by asking: "If you can't be arsed to vote, why should we be arsed to listen to your political point of view?" But Paxman later told the Radio Times he had some sympathy with Brand's position. "I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo chamber. But it is all we have," he said. On his decision not to vote, he said: "By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote - cannot even be bothered to write 'none of the above' on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all." On BBC Radio 4's PM, comedian Ken Dodd was asked what he thought of Brand's stance, replying: "It's stupid. To be able to vote is a great privilege. "It's a privilege granted to every citizen, and we are citizens of the greatest country in the world and therefore we must preserve that." </body>

      <body>The deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats, Simon Hughes, has apologised to the Commons for failing to register six donations to his local party. The Commons Standards Committee cleared him of breaking rules against lobbying. But it said such a senior and experienced MP should have taken advice about the code of conduct. The committee's report followed an investigation into Mr Hughes by the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, after complaints were made about him. The Southwark MP had been criticised for not mentioning the financial interests during parliamentary debates. Mr Hughes' apology came during a personal statement in the Commons, on the order of the Standards Committee. The watchdog found that the veteran Lib Dem MP did not tell the parliamentary authorities about six donations to his local party over six years which were linked to him. But it said it had found no attempt had been made to conceal the donations. Addressing the chamber, Mr Hughes said he accepted entirely the findings that he was "not as attentive as he should have been to the rules of the House". "I have of course admitted my mistakes and I apologised from the outset to the commissioner and to the committee," he said. Mr Hughes added: "I will immediately register the outstanding interests as the committee recommends. I take full responsibility for these failures and I apologise unreservedly to the House." All the donations in question were reported to the Electoral Commission by Mr Hughes's local party, the report said. </body>

      <body>The Iraq Inquiry says it cannot proceed with the next phase of its work because key information, including correspondence between Tony Blair and George W Bush, has yet to be released. The inquiry chaired by Sir John Chilcot had hoped to begin contacting those likely to be criticised in its report this autumn, to allow them to respond. But it said it had not yet agreed with the government over the publication of the most "difficult documents". The inquiry began its work in 2009. In a statement on the inquiry's website, Sir John said the next phase of its work was "dependent on the satisfactory completion of discussions between the inquiry and the government on disclosure of material that the inquiry wishes to include in its report or publish alongside it". He added: "Since June this year the inquiry has submitted 10 requests covering some 200 cabinet-level discussions, 25 notes from Mr Blair to President Bush and more than 130 records of conversations between either Mr Blair or Mr [Gordon] Brown and President Bush. "The inquiry secretariat has responded to a number of Cabinet Office questions on those requests, but the government and the inquiry have not reached a final position on the disclosure of these more difficult categories of document." Sir John has written to Prime Minister David Cameron to express his regret that no agreement has yet been reached. In his reply, the prime minister acknowledged the progress that had been made and said he was "aware of the scale of the task declassification has presented to a number of government departments". He added: "I appreciate consideration of the disclosure requests for the remaining sensitive categories of information must be handled sensitively and carefully but I hope that consideration of the final sets of papers can be concluded as soon as possible." A spokeswoman for No 10 said she had nothing to add to the prime minister's letter. The Cabinet Office has released a statement saying "discussions are continuing between the government and the inquiry about the disclosure of records". BBC political correspondent Carole Walker said this was the latest in a series of delays to the long-running inquiry. The inquiry, which is examining the background to the UK's involvement in the 2003 invasion and its aftermath, has never set a firm deadline for publishing its final report - set to be about a million words long. However, it was initially expected to be published in 2012. </body>

      <body>Recordings of messages left by David Blunkett on a married woman's phone were found in the safe of a News International lawyer, a jury has heard. Police discovered tapes of voicemails from the then home secretary to Kimberly Quinn in the office of Tom Crone, the phone-hacking trial heard. The recordings were described as "deeply personal and intrusive". The News of the World exposed Mr Blunkett's three-year relationship with Ms Quinn in 2004. During Thursday's evidence, the court was told of an alleged conspiracy to hack the voicemails of the former cabinet minister. The jury was shown notes made by NoW private investigator, Glenn Mulcaire, relating to Mr Blunkett - which included his phone numbers, address and details of his sons. Mulcaire has already admitted phone hacking. The notes referred to "multiple recordings, over 330", some of which were voice messages left by Mr Blunkett on Ms Quinn's phone. Tapes of the recordings were recovered from the safe of Tom Crone - a lawyer for News International, the parent company of The Sun and NoW. Some of the voicemails and transcripts found by police detailed Mr Blunkett's feelings about the end of the relationship with Ms Quinn, the jury heard. Giving evidence, Det Con Tim Hargreaves, from the Metropolitan Police's investigation into phone hacking, described them as "deeply personal and intrusive". The court was told that police also recovered a draft version of a story on Mr Blunkett's affair, apparently written by reporter Neville Thurlbeck. Throughout the draft, he referred to the cabinet minister and the woman by the code names "Noddy", for Mr Blunkett, and "Big Ears". The jury then heard that Mr Blunkett was visited in August 2004 by Andrew Coulson, the then editor of the NoW, who wanted the politician to admit to the relationship. Mr Blunkett recorded the meeting, in which Mr Coulson told him the paper was planning to publish the story. Mr Coulson was heard to say: "What I will tell you is that I am certainly very confident of the information. "My job is to make sure that I sift out the nonsense from the accurate information and either I do my job well or I don't do my job well. I believe the story to be true..." He added: "It is based on extremely reliable sources." The jury was then shown the NoW story from 15 August that exposed the relationship, quoting "a source". But the prosecution argued the source being referred to was the taping of the hacked voicemails of Ms Quinn. The jury also heard that Mulcaire had made out a bill for £750 for "Project Blunkett", which included "inquiries, observations and other research". Mr Coulson, 45, of Charing, Kent, denies both conspiracy to hack phones and conspiracy to commit misconduct. Earlier in court, the judge warned that evidence suggesting Sven-Goran Eriksson's phone was hacked over four years by the NoW should not be taken as fact. It had been alleged on Wednesday that the ex-England manager and FA employee Faria Alam were monitored by Mulcaire between 2002 and 2006. The phone-hacking trial heard the paper then exposed their relationship. But Mr Justice Saunders stressed it was not accepted by the defence that all of Mulcaire's notes about the pair were from phone hacks. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>A centre of rural excellence is to be developed on the site of the former Maze Prison site, despite a political block on the wider project. The Maze Long Kesh Development Corporation and Royal Ulster Agricultural Society, have signed an agreement about the centre. Earlier, this year First Minister Peter Robinson stalled plans to build a peace centre on the County Antrim site. The move caused tension between his party, the DUP, and Sinn Féin. Mr Robinson had said there needed to be a broad consensus on how it would operate and what it would contain - and that is currently absent, in his view. In September, Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness said there could be no development of the wider Maze site unless it was on the basis of previous agreements about the building of a peace centre. An EU funding programme later withdrew its offer of £18m in financial support for the peace centre. The Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) held its Balmoral Show at the site for the first time this year. On Friday, RUAS chief executive Colin McDonald said they had ambitious plans for the venue. "It's definitely a work in progress, this is another positive step. It gives us the chance to go forward with our proposals," he said. The Maze housed paramilitary prisoners during the Troubles from 1971 - 2000. Ten republican prisoners died on hunger strike there. </body>

      <body>Scotland's deputy first minister and finance secretary are meeting directors and union representatives at the Scotstoun shipyard. It follows an announcement of a major restructuring by BAE, which runs Scotstoun and the nearby Govan yard. About 800 jobs will be lost in Scotland while 940 jobs will go at Portsmouth, where shipbuilding will end. A protest rally will be held in Portsmouth on Saturday followed by a march through the city a week later. Scotland's Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Finance Secretary John Swinney are meeting BAE Systems directors and union representatives during their visit on Friday morning. Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael visited the Govan shipyard on Thursday. Shipbuilding is to end completely at BAE's yard at Portsmouth, while the two Clyde yards have been earmarked for building the Royal Navy's new Type 26 warships. UK Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said the designs for the new ships would not be finalised until the end of next year, which would be after the Scottish independence referendum on 18 September. Mr Carmichael has previously argued Scotland would find it "difficult" to win UK government shipbuilding contracts if the country votes for independence. But the Scottish government has dismissed suggestions that a "Yes" vote would put future shipyard orders in doubt and said joint procurement of Type 26 vessels could be possible, with Ms Sturgeon accusing her political rivals of trying to "blackmail" Scots into voting "No" in next year's independence referendum. In Portsmouth, a meeting was held between Portsmouth Trades Council, BAE workers and union representatives on Thursday. A statement from the trades council said: "The loss of 940 skilled shipbuilding jobs in Portsmouth will be a disaster. It is not just the workers and their families who will suffer. The knock-on effects for the local economy will be huge and will trigger even more job losses. "We should not follow the lead of local politicians who argue to cut jobs in Scotland to save jobs in Portsmouth. "We should fight to save all shipbuilding jobs, wherever they are. BAE and the government can be put under pressure to keep the shipyard jobs, if there is a concerted campaign." </body>

      <title>Landlord fear over welfare reform</title>
      <description>A private sector landlord with more than 700 homes says benefit changes could put his business at risk.</description>

      <body>A private sector landlord with more than 700 homes says benefit changes could put his business at risk. Carmarthenshire-based Kevin Green fears tenants will fall behind on their rent when a new system of paying benefits is introduced. He says he may have to stop letting to people on welfare. The UK government says it is restoring fairness to the welfare system, and that it is working on protecting landlords and tenants. Most of the 762 properties Mr Green lets are in or near Llanelli. Around 60% of his tenants receive benefits, he says. Last month the UK government began phasing in one of its big welfare reforms - Universal Credit. The roll-out is due to finish in October 2017. Next spring Shotton, Flintshire, will become the first part of Wales where it is introduced. Six working-age benefits - including housing benefit - will be merged into one monthly payment into the claimant's bank account. A trial of the system in Torfaen among social housing tenants found arrears rose from around £20,000 to almost £140,000 in seven months. Private sector tenants already have their housing benefit paid to them, rather than it going directly to the landlord. But millionaire Mr Green, who experienced homelessness in 1984, said he feared some would struggle with their household finances and fail to keep up with the rent when benefits are merged. "What we're finding is if rent payment is put in the tenants' hands they are not being taught in school or further education to run a home and they just can't budget," he told BBC Wales Sunday Politics. "And it's going to lead to huge arrears. It could lead to us going bust at the end of the day and not providing homes for less fortunate people as well." He added: "If we pull out the market that's hundreds of houses that we rent out in this area that's pulled out. "We're the UK's largest private sector landlord. We pull those out of the social welfare market and that's houses that people haven't got to live on housing benefit." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesperson said: "Our reforms restore fairness to a system that was allowed to spiral out of control. "We are working now to ensure that the right protection and exemptions are in place for both tenants and landlords ahead of Universal Credit. "Direct payments are an important part of Universal Credit to make it easier for people to move into work, but we've been clear from the outset that we will take steps to protect vulnerable people." The Sunday Politics Wales can be seen from 12:25 on BBC1 Wales on Sunday. </body>

      <title>Lords quiz energy firms over fracking</title>
      <description>The four bosses of the energy firms hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling give evidence to the Lords Economic Affairs Committee.</description>

      <body>The four bosses of companies hoping to develop shale gas and oil drilling in the UK have given evidence to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee. Francis Egan, chief executive of Cuadrilla, IGas Energy CEO Andrew Austin, Tom Crotty, director of INEO, and INEOS gas procurement manager Andrew Mackenzie were questioned on the scope for commercial shale gas extraction by peers on Tuesday. They were also asked which areas were most likely to produce shale gas, and when production might start. Andrew Austin was up first. He said they knew there was an awful lot of gas out there but what they needed to know was whether they could technically recover it and if it could be economical. Then it was the turn of Francis Egan of Cuadrilla. Quietly spoken and calm, you could sense his frustration that, as he put it, the difference between exploration and exploitation was not well understood. He repeatedly said they had not drilled shale at the Balcombe site in West Sussex and no hydraulic fracturing - fracking - had taken place either. Asked if he "could put his hand on his heart and say fracking is completely safe?", he said yes without any hesitation. He also said he could categorically say there was no correlation between fracking and cancers, which was one of the scare stories he'd heard. The point all four made was that the level of scrutiny on shale gas exploration was much higher than for tradition oil and gas and they thought the government needed to help sell the benefits - such as the potential to create anywhere between 25,000 and 100,000 jobs. They said there was the potential to create "another Aberdeen" - potentially in the North West of the country. After the hearing I spoke to the committee chair, Lord McGregor. He was at pains to point out they were not even half way through the inquiry process but said he thought the bosses had made a good case. Lord McGregor also cited the example of the US, where fracking has helped transform the economy and lower utility bills; the energy bosses gave no such assurances on utility bills. Mr Egan said he'd worked in oil and gas all his life and had "never seen an accurate oil price forecast" because the price was controlled by supply and demand. He also said if they didn't explore shale gas and oil opportunities everyone would have to pay higher prices for imported fuel eventually. The bosses estimate the UK's oil and gas is due to run out by about 2030, with Britain then being forced to import supplies from Russia or China at potentially much higher costs and with greater security risks. While the bosses calmly gave evidence to the committee, the No Fracking in Balcombe Society was among a group of campaigners delivering an open letter to the prime minister. They want the government to compensate communities for any fall in house prices or tourism resulting from fracking, and any environmental fallout that affects industries such as farming. The contrast between the way the two groups delivered their arguments brings into sharp focus the deep divisions on both sides of this debate - the need to keep the lights on weighed against the need to protect the environment. Despite the weeks of protests in Balcombe this summer, the energy bosses seemed optimistic the public mood would turn in their favour. Mr Egan said his firm could start drilling tomorrow if it had planning permission. This debate still has some way to go. Next up in front of the committee will be representatives of the Environment Agency and government ministers. And with energy prices under the spotlight like never before the government will be keen to explore all alternative forms of energy supplies. </body>

      <title>City's shipbuilding loss 'a tragedy'</title>
      <description>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose shipbuilding has been described as a "catastrophe".</description>

      <body>For a city with a proud maritime history, the news that Portsmouth will lose its shipbuilding industry has been described as a "catastrophe". About 900 job losses are expected at the BAE yard, which employs about 1,200 people. The site will stay open, with a focus on repairs and maintenance, but there is no prospect of new ships. For the south coast port, which considers itself the home of the Royal Navy, it is a big blow. The city's maritime links are clear for any visitor to see. Henry VIII's flagship Mary Rose, HMS Victory, from which Admiral Nelson commanded victory at the Battle of Trafalgar and the battleship HMS Warrior are proudly displayed in the city's dockyard. The Royal Navy's new aircraft carriers will be based at Portsmouth Naval Dockyard - which was under threat a few years ago. Losing shipbuilding will be felt far and wide across the Solent region. Many workers said they had been "forbidden" to speak to the media as they left the Portsmouth yard following the announcement. But one, who did not want to be named, described a "bad mood" among staff. "Basically there's about six months work left," he said. "It's not really unexpected, we knew it was coming." Another added: "It's a sad day for the loss of work in the South yet again. "[It's] a political decision for Scotland to have all the work and us have nothing." The mood in Portsmouth earlier matched those of the workers. Derek Brown, who started 40 years of work as a shipwright when he was 15, said: "For years it's been run down but it's unfortunate a lot of people will lose their jobs - people with mortgages and bills to pay. "When I first went in there was 22,000 people working in there. It was a job for life then but times change." Patricia Hawkins added: "Portsmouth will be a ghost town. We'll end up with a museum not a dockyard and what happens when we need ships to go to war again?" Portsmouth South MP Mike Hancock said the news was a "personal tragedy for everyone who's going into work in the yard today". He added: "And that's a personal tragedy for them and a catastrophe for the city of Portsmouth to lose so many highly-skilled jobs which will be virtually impossible to replace in that line. "I think it's a national disgrace that we're going put all their expertise and investment that's gone into the yard in Portsmouth at risk by closing it down and putting all your eggs into one basket." Ian Woodland, South East regional officer for the Unite union, said the news means skilled workers will be left on the "scrap heap". "[The] Tories are clueless about how to deal with BAE job losses in Portsmouth. Where will these people work?," he said. "There are no jobs for these workers. "BAE job losses in Portsmouth will affect [the] whole of Solent area. Many BAE employees [also] live in Southampton." Maureen Frost, executive director of Hampshire Chamber of Commerce, said it would be working with the city council to try and help those affected. "Losing the shipbuilding side is devastating news for the city," she added. "It's also about the supply chain and those small businesses that supply into BAE Systems so there's going to be a major impact. "It may not just be one person in one family, with the tradition of shipbuilding here sometimes it's the whole family involved." BAE launched a review of its defence work 18 months ago when it became apparent that future work, following the completion of the new aircraft carriers, was unlikely to sustain yards in Portsmouth as well as Govan and Scotstoun in Scotland. And it is Portsmouth that will make way. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest.

She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999.

In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011.

This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister.

Chair Margaret Hodge said bringing in Universal Credit had been an "unmitigated disaster" but was salvageable if the DWP stopped having "ridiculous time deadlines". She called on it to "fess up to the money wasted so far" and said it must "scrap its useless IT system and start again".

      <body>The threat of UK interest rates rising in the next few months would be dangerous, said City analyst David Buik as the Bank of England held the historic low rate of 0.5% for the 56th consecutive month on Thursday lunchtime. But Mr Buik warned that they "cannot remain at that level for an indefinite period of time", With the the economy growing and unemployment falling, there is more talk of a rate rise in 2014, despite bank governor Mark Carney offering "forward guidance" with no rise planned until 2016. But Mr Buik said holding down interest rates with inflation above 2%, could put a "huge burden on any government, whatever its political persuasion is, to deal with welfare and to deal with pensions."

      <title>What price democracy? Counting the cost of UK elections</title>
      <description>BBC expert seeks to calculate the cost of UK elections</description>

      <body>Polling day for many in the media is the lull before the storm: seemingly endless advance preparation awaits vindication from the main event which, for broadcasters, begins at 10pm. However, at each election a massive operation that completely dwarfs anything we plan to do has also been in preparation for many months and is launched 15 hours ahead of the election results programmes taking to to the air. The precise details of how elections are delivered are hard to pin down. According to Hansard, on 27 April 2011, Labour MP John Spellar asked in the Commons "the cost to the public purse of the 2010 general election". Cabinet Office minister Mark Harper replied: "We have estimated that the cost of the 2010 UK parliamentary election will be £113,255,271. This figure consists of £28,655,271 for the cost of distributing candidates' mailings and a further £84.6 million for the conduct of the poll." British Electoral Facts 1832-2012 records the following total costs for election administration and postal deliveries (cash totals unadjusted for inflation): All of the above excludes spending by individual candidates and national party organisations: in 2010 this amounted to an additional £45.5m - £31.5m on national campaigns and £14m of candidates' expenses. We know that the 2010 general election was contested by 4,150 candidates, representing 135 political parties; that UK electoral registers contained some 45.6 million entries (an increase of 1.3 million since the 2005 general election); that just over 82% of all votes were cast in polling stations and the remaining 12% by post. And that, as they say, is about it as far as the information goes. In December 2012, the Electoral Commission published their report "Cost of the May 2011 referendum on the UK Parliamentary voting system". The introduction states: "This is the first time that a full report has been published on the costs of running a national poll." Given the 2011 Alternative Vote referendum was a UK-wide event, it is the closest we are likely to come to the scale of organisation required in a general election. As with the 2010 general election, the 2011 AV referendum polling day was shared with a number of other elections: on this occasion those for the Scottish Parliament, Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies, as well as local elections across most of England and all of Northern Ireland. As a consequence, various costs incurred were shared with these other bodies polling on the same day. The total cost of administering the referendum was £58.2m. However, the report states: "We estimate that this referendum would have cost around £90m had it been held on a 'stand alone' basis." Nearly 45.7 million people were registered to vote in the 2011 referendum and almost 19.3 million (42.2%) did so. What was the scale of organisation involved? There were 42,781 polling stations used throughout the UK and hired at a cost of £4.3m. The average cost of hiring a polling station was £637 ranging between £486 on average in Wales through to an average of £1,323 in London. The polling stations were staffed by 119,500 people throughout the day at a cost of £15.6m. Some 45.7 million ballot papers were printed at a cost of £2.7m; and the equipment at the stations - ballot boxes, polling booths, etc. - cost £1.5m. Almost 7.2 million postal votes were printed and despatched for the referendum and 5.2 million were returned in their pre-paid envelopes. Some 45.7 million poll cards were printed and delivered to every elector. About 19.3 million votes cast in 42,781 polling stations across the UK were transported to 400 count venues where 80,500 people were employed to count them. The report comments: "The costs of referendum (or indeed party political) campaign broadcasts have not to our knowledge been estimated before." Undaunted, they asked "the commercial broadcasters" to estimate the total value of the Yes and No campaign broadcasts if they had had to pay for the space. The estimate they came up with was £420,000 for television broadcasts and £30,000 for those on radio. In addition to the total of £58.2m spent on administering the referendum, the Electoral Commission spent £7.5m on its public awareness campaigning, including the delivery of an information booklet to 27.8 million households. They paid a further £8.8m to the Royal Mail, including £1.5m for delivering 8.5 million items of campaign literature from Yes to fairer Votes and £6.7m for delivering 40 million items from the No to AV campaign. This summary of the detail of how the 2011 AV referendum was organised presents a picture that is likely to be very similar to what will be in place for May 2015. The estimated cost of a "stand alone" referendum was £90m - barely £5m more than the cost of the 2010 general election. Prior to polling day in 2015, around seven million postal votes will have been despatched and about six million returned and processed. Over 45 million ballot papers will have been printed to reflect 650 separate candidate lists for the election and the same number of poll cards delivered to electors. On polling day there will be around 43,000 polling stations staffed for 15 hours by 120,000 people. On election night, thousands of ballot boxes will be transported to centres where more than 80,000 people will sort and count their contents. Like most people, I take all this for granted, barely giving a second thought. Yet it is a massive, extraordinary and complex operation: the biggest manifestation of civic society that any of us are ever likely to see. </body>

      <body>Equalities Minister Jo Swinson has said she does not think it is sexist to offer a pregnant woman a seat. The heavily pregnant MP found herself at the centre of a twitter storm after reports she was forced to stand during prime minister's questions. An aide to Ms Swinson was reported as saying it was "sexist" to expect a seat to be offered. Ms Swinson declined to comment at the time but has now attempted to set the record straight in a web chat. The MP told an online discussion on Mumsnet.com: "I never said that, and absolutely don't think it is sexist. "It's lovely to be offered a seat - I don't always want one though." She continued: "On the Tube with heavy bags, often I say yes, though that day at PMQs I knew I could only be there for 15 minutes and was standing with my back against a wooden pillar very comfortably. "It was a little frustrating that the media seemed not to care whether I actually thought it was a problem or not, and deemed that if I was standing it must obviously have been because I had been 'forced' to, as they put it! "I just think it's great for people to offer, and part of life's little courtesies. Though when I was incredibly fatigued at about 10 weeks but of course didn't look pregnant was when it has been most difficult so far!" The live online discussion was focused on "body confidence". One contributor asked: "Do you agree that women should be getting angry about the cultural pressures heaped upon us and our daughters?" "Yes, we should be angry, as you say, not just for ourselves but also for our daughters," the minister responded. "Our body confidence campaign in government is trying to address some of these cultural pressures - there are also huge issues around media sexism, which I've met campaigners about recently. "Parents - and all of us - have a role to play too - both in challenging stereotypes in conversation and in our purchasing decisions, and encouraging companies and media outlets to act differently." Ms Swinson's child, her first, is due on Christmas Day, according to reports. </body>

      <description>The politics of ending shipbuilding at Portsmouth</description>

      <body>Take many hundreds of job losses, add the fact they're in a strategic industry, stir in the end of more than half a millennium of shipbuilding history and top it all up with the raw politics of Scottish independence. What you have got is a very potent brew. Two key questions are likely to dominate the political reaction to the news that shipbuilding is to end at Portsmouth: 1. Have English shipyard workers paid the price for keeping jobs in Glasgow? First things first: why are the job losses happening at all? Cuts were always inevitable after the completion of two massive aircraft carriers - a once in 30 or 40 year event. Even the placing of orders for 13 new frigates was never going to replace the lost work. What's more, cuts to the defence budget mean that there's a gap between the end of work on the carriers and the start of work on Type 26 Global Combat Ships. Government and industry insiders insist that the choice of Govan over Portsmouth was a decision first considered over three years ago - long before Alex Salmond was even re-elected as First Minister of Scotland in 2011 let alone the announcement of a referendum date. It was discussed as part of the Strategic Defence and Security Review carried out as soon as the coalition came to power in 2010. A senior defence industry figure has told my BBC colleague John Moylan that BAE Systems recommended to government that shipbuilding at Portsmouth should end as long as two years ago. He said: "This is not about Scotland and independence - closing shipbuilding at Portsmouth is the sensible strategic decision for the long term." I'm told that Govan has two advantages over Portsmouth - a lower cost base and a partnership with the Scotstoun shipyard on the other side of the Clyde. Tory strategists point out that it's hardly in their political interests to save a Scottish shipyard and part close an English one. Nevertheless, it's clear that there can be no decision on something as significant as the building of warships without a great deal of political calculation. As I reported yesterday, one well-placed source told me that the government was "acutely conscious of the politics of the Clyde" and did not want to give Alex Salmond a gift a little less than a year ahead of the independence referendum. 2. If Scotland votes next year to become an independent nation will "rump UK" (or whatever what is left will be called) have to depend on a foreign country to build its warships? Not necessarily. Shipbuilding will not end immediately at Portsmouth. Even when it does some of those employed in the city by BAE Systems will continue working on ship repair and maintenance. Work on the new frigates will begin long after the Scottish referendum vote. It will be interesting to examine the deal the government does with BAE to see whether it includes a "get out" clause allowing work on the frigates to be transferred from Glasgow to Portsmouth if Scotland votes for independence. Govan's local Labour MP Ian Davidson wants just such a clause as part of his campaign to persuade people to vote No in the referendum. One of those who has been consulted about this decision told me that if Scotland votes No it would still be possible to switch work to England. </body>

      <description>Do MPs agree with Russell Brand and Jeremy Paxman?</description>

      <body>BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman has condemned the "green-bench pantomime in Westminster" and comedian Russell Brand has criticised "the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". BBC Radio 4's PM programme asked three MPs for their views on voter apathy. Like it or not, most people's lives are run by political decisions and those political decisions are made by politicians that you elect. The trouble is that not enough people bother to go out and elect us. There's a cynicism; we don't help ourselves. Interestingly, last night I was at a dinner and an MP got up and the first thing she said was: "Before I was an MP I had a proper job." She was a youth worker. We're actually quite self-deprecating and that plays into the hands of cynical people, of which I would count Jeremy Paxman, who have this caricature of politicians as a bunch of duplicitous so-and-sos on some big gravy train, living the life of Riley. Actually being an MP is a job, it's an exceptional job, and most of us spend an awful lot of time, blood, sweat and tears, putting a lot of effort into it. I don't mind people attacking my political policies, and they can say I've got it absolutely wrong over certain things I've been doing in my constituency, or in Westminster - but this constant attack that actually all MPs are duplicitous, and we're just on this gravy train and we're good for nothing, and it's all a pantomime is deeply undermining of the democratic process, and can only switch people off from bothering to vote, particularly young people. That's why barely 40% of young people at the last election who were able to vote for the first time - 18 to 24-year-olds - actually bothered to vote, and that really is worrying for the future. [Russell Brand is] deeply destructive, actually. Watching that interview with Jeremy Paxman he's very amusing, very articulate, but it's deeply destructive, the influence on young people who think, "Gosh, Russell said we shouldn't bother to vote, let's not vote". The way not to get [turnout] to improve is to say, it's all a waste of time and to go on the champagne anarchist ego trip that Russell Brand is on. That really doesn't help. I did some work at the beginning of the century, in 2001, when the turnout in my constituency was particularly low. What I found was that people weren't apathetic about voting, they were angry. It was anger not apathy that motivated them. The problem really is that we tend to set our agenda from the Westminster bubble, so what concerns us here in Westminster.... we really don't listen, and we really don't connect to people in the community enough. So I've completely changed the way I do my politics from that experience. Now the first thing I do is listen, and people's politics really starts from the local, they care about what's happening in their home, and in their local community. Quite often I can't address the national issues that worry them: I couldn't address the issues about immigration in Barking before the last election, or the lack of social housing. But I could address the issues about the post boxes, where they were sited, or whether the rubbish was collected, or whether we had prostitution on the street corner. When I started addressing those issues that really concerned them, I connected with local people, I started to build trust, and I then got people voting again and voting for me, and seeing off [2010 BNP general election candidate for Barking] Nick Griffin. Whilst Russell Brand may be right to be fed up, the answer is not revolution. There are no great divides in principle between the three parties. By and large we're all in favour of the mixed economy, we're all by and large - with some exceptions - in favour of state education, the kind of things which were battles between different parties have disappeared. In addition to that, politics has become a question of management: can you manage the economy better than I can? The third thing, rather paradoxically, is that the information technology revolution has meant that the age of deference has been swept aside, and I'm in no doubt whatsoever that there were people in the House of Commons 20, 30, 40 years ago who were a lot less than the perfect MP, but of course in those days no-one knew. On the whole question of executive pay: 50 years ago, my mother wouldn't have had the slightest idea what the director general of the BBC was paid, and she wouldn't have thought it was her business, but now because information is better available people are better informed and inevitably people are less charitable. [Russell Brand showed] a real lack of self-awareness: everything's wrong, but absolutely no suggestions as to how it would be put right. If Russell Brand were the prime minister, imagine what kind of country it would be - if you possibly can.

      <title>Can UK economy stay top of the league?</title>
      <description>Is the UK economic recovery like Arsenal's?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24833200</url>
      <date>1383732051</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70939000/jpg/_70939150_robertpeston.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Why is the British economy like my favourite football team, Arsenal FC? We're both top of the league - by a margin (blimey, it's been a few years since I said that). If the latest Markit survey of business activity and orders is accurate, the British economy is growing at a remarkably rapid 1.3% in the last three months of the year - which would be faster than any other rich developed economy. The UK is growing significantly faster than Germany and the US, for example - and probably faster than Japan, which in my strained analogy is Liverpool FC, whose under-performance has endured even longer than Arsenal's. If that estimated British growth rate is accurate and sustained, UK GDP in 2013 will rise over 3% - which is significantly faster than any mainstream economist is currently predicting and would be a return to growth rates we haven't enjoyed since the financial and economic crash of 2007-8. So the question about the British economy is the same as the question about Arsenal. Is the current success built on solid foundations - it it sustainable? Probably the first thing to say, if you're an Arsenal supporter or a British citizen, is that any recovery will do, after six bleak years (longer for the Gooners). But the worry would be that the economy and Arsenal are a bit thin in defence and attack. What do I mean? Well, after the election, the hope of the government was that this would be a recovery different from all others in modern times, one led by exports and business investment, in order to reduce the UK's economic dependence on debt-fuelled consumer spending and economic activity linked to a booming housing market. To use the ghastly jargon, the economy would be rebalanced, so that we would gradually reduce the deficit between what we buy from the rest of the world versus what we sell abroad - a deficit that has put the debts of the UK on a rising trajectory for 30 years. It was a bit like the hope of Arsenal that it could win the Premier League without spending record sums on world-class players, or paying those inflated wages of more than £100,000 a week. Well, business investment plummeted in 2008 and has never properly recovered. And the gap between exports and imports has remained stubbornly wide. In fact in the first three months of the year, the UK's deficit with the rest of the world was a shocking 5.5% of GDP, before narrowing to a still too-wide 3.2% in the second quarter. The result has been a failure by the UK to restore economic output back to where it was in early 2008, which has contributed to a painful and persistent squeeze in living standards. And there has been an analogous absence of any trophies in the Emirates' cabinet, as a consequence of a policy decision not to splash the cash on superstars. But 2013 has been a year of modest ideological shift (should we say U-turn?) by Wenger and Osborne. Arsenal's Wenger relented and forked out £42m for the balletic and brilliant Ozil, and has allegedly smashed through the wage hierarchy at the club in the process. And the British chancellor belatedly concluded that it was highly unlikely that the UK economy would gain what economists call "lift-off momentum" without the traditional boost to the morale of British consumers from a reviving housing market. So George Osborne launched versions one and two of the Help to Buy scheme, which provides many billions of pounds of taxpayer loans and guarantees for house construction and house purchases. Here is the thing. Respective revivals based solely on a few star midfield players or on debt-fuelled consumption would end in tears. So can the recoveries be underpinned - in the case of the economy, by businesses belatedly starting to invest and getting better at selling to the rest of the world; and at Arsenal, by reinforcement of defence and attack in the January transfer window? And here the football analogy implodes. Arsenal can afford to invest in new players having been prudent in the way it has managed its finances in boom years and lean years. By contrast, the UK economy is still shouldering record and rising debts, equivalent to more than five times the value of economic output (based on aggregating household, business, financial and government debts). Which means that the British economic recovery could be self-immolating in a way that I don't think could happen to Arsenal. What do I mean? If the Bank of England became concerned that the speed of growth was becoming inflationary, it could push up interest rates much faster than is currently implied by its so-called "forward guidance" on this. And with household liabilities still equivalent to some 140% of household resources, and with an estimated five million households shouldering excessive debts, sharp rises in interest rates would cause profound misery. That misery would not be confined simply to people. It would also infect our banks (again), which would suffer significant losses as borrowers discovered that they could not afford to pay interest rates above today's abnormally low rates. So if you think there's pressure being Osborne or Wenger, it is probably as nothing compared with the burden on the Canuck governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney. If he and his colleagues raise interest rates too soon and too much, there's a risk the recovery will be suffocated at birth, or worse. Were he to raise them too late, there is a danger that the financial precariousness of households and banks would actually be worsened, as they ship in more debt - and the anti-inflation credentials of the Bank would be undermined, perhaps fatally. Now what would Alex Ferguson have done? </body>

      <title>11-plus coaching culture 'must end'</title>
      <description>An educational charity says the culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must end so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools.</description>

      <body>The culture of coaching pupils for 11-plus exams must be ended so poor bright children are not excluded from grammar schools, an educational charity says. The Sutton Trust says grammar school entrance tests should also be changed regularly so they are tutor-proof. It urges grammar schools to offer test preparation classes to all candidates, so there is a "more level playing field" between rich and poor pupils. The government gives extra money to schools with disadvantaged pupils. The report, Poor Grammar: Entry into Grammar Schools for Disadvantaged Pupils in England, says pupils from very low income families are outnumbered by four to one in grammar schools by children from fee-paying prep schools. It found only 2.7% of grammar school entrants were from families who qualified for free school meals, while 12.7% came from outside England's state sector - mainly independent schools. Overall in England about 20% of pupils are on free school meals. It is well known that many children from affluent homes are coached for entrance tests, with private tutors offering expensive coaching services particularly in areas where grammar schools are high achieving but few in number. The report also suggested that many parents were using the private preparatory school route to get their children through grammar school doors. Those on lower incomes are less likely to be able to afford to pay for tutoring or private education. Grammars that stand alone, rather than in a wholly selective authority such as Buckinghamshire or Kent, draw pupils from a wide geographical area. This is also true of London grammars which have wide catchment areas, with sometimes 10 or 11 candidates for every place. The competition for places is very intense and not just based on passing the 11-plus but getting the highest marks. The report called for these high achieving schools to increase outreach work "significantly". This could mean such schools encouraging low and middle income households to apply and doing more to dispel the the view that some parents may have of them as "elitist", it said. It even suggests giving priority to poor, bright pupils who meet certain entrance requirements and are eligible for the pupil premium because their families have been in receipt of certain benefits in the previous few years. And once tests are reformed, it suggests children should be provided with at least 10 hours free, or subsidised preparation for entrance tests, so applicants from all backgrounds are given an even chance of success. Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl said: "Politicians of all parties have accepted that grammar schools are here to stay, and while their numbers are not growing, the number of pupils admitted to them has risen by a quarter, or 30,000, since 1997 and is likely to continue to grow in the years ahead. "Some grammar schools are working to improve access, and grammar schools in Northern Ireland have a far better record than English grammar schools." In his foreword to the report, he said: "The challenge to the sector and for those areas where a selective system prevails is how to ensure that those grammar schools are open to all, and are not simply a preserve of better-off families who can afford private tutors or prep schools fees." He added: "We need fairer tests and there should be a minimum of 10 hours free or subsidised test preparation for all applicants to provide a more level playing field." But National Grammar Schools Association chairman Robert McCartney said the fact that three-quarters of England had no grammar school meant that it was not fair to compare national figures on pupils on free school meals. He added that the report makes clear that grammar schools are a good thing and they are not going to go away. "Clearly since 1997 there have been an additional 300,000 pupils at the 164 grammar schools in England. That really means something like an extra 30 grammar schools with pupils of 1,000 each." He welcomed the idea that grammar schools provide test preparation classes to all pupils, but said it was impossible to design a written test that was not amenable to coaching. However, he agreed that many pupils found their way into grammar schools because they had been heavily coached for the tests. He added: "Grammar school heads report that many pupils have been totally over-coached and begin to struggle further up the school." He said the reason that this coaching industry had come about was because of the "paucity of grammar school places in England". The Department for Education did not wish to comment on the report. </body>

      <title>'Student fees may reach £20,000'</title>
      <description>Some universities may charge students from England up to £20,000 a year, a vice-chancellor tells the Times Higher Education magazine.</description>

      <body>Some universities may eventually charge students from England up to £20,000 a year, a vice-chancellor has told the Times Higher Education magazine. Tuition fees paid by home students at English institutions are capped at £9,000, overseas students pay more. The sector may start to see both groups the same way, says Prof Nick Petford, of Northampton University His comments come as a report argues that universities will need more money to cope as demand for places rises. The report, published on Thursday by the umbrella group Universities UK (UUK), says that higher fees charged by universities since last year have merely replaced cuts to government funding. Some forecasts predict that the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000 within the next 20 years. The report says this means institutions will need extra money to invest in buildings and facilities if they are to compete with universities in other countries. Many universities are already relying on sources of income other than fees or government money to pay for new building projects, it says. Prof Petford is the third university vice-chancellor to argue that the cap on annual fees, currently set at a maximum of £9,000, will need to rise. Last week UUK president and Surrey University vice-chancellor Sir Christopher Snowden urged the government to allow fees to keep pace with inflation. In September the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Prof Andrew Hamilton, said fees should be related to the true cost of a degree - or £16,000 in the case of Oxford. Both said that some universities and departments were losing money, particularly on expensive courses such as science, technology or engineering. Prof Petford argues that some universities "with high brand value will be able to charge £17,000, £18,000 or £20,000 in the future - I am sure of that". "If you look at international students that's been a pretty much unregulated market since we've been recruiting overseas students," he said. "Universities have always been used to this sort of behaviour. "The big step change now is thinking about home students in this way." He agrees that universities could increasingly find themselves short of cash if the government maintains the £9,000 cap on fees. "It is quite easy to do a financial forecast which shows that if the cap remains at £9,000 in the next decade, a number of universities, including ours, could potentially be in financial difficulty." Prof Petford acknowledges it would not be easy for any political party to adopt a tuition fee rise as policy in the run-up to the next election. He said: "As a vote winner, it's just not going to work is it?" Any change in tuition fees would have to be agreed by Parliament. The Department for Business Innovation and Skills maintains that the current £9,000 maximum fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching and to invest in improved teaching facilities, while ensuring that going to university remains affordable for students. </body>

      <title>Global tests for schools in England</title>
      <description>Secondary schools in England will be able to compare their standards with top Asian countries, as individual schools are able to take international Pisa tests.</description>

      <body>Individual secondary schools in England will be able to take influential international tests to see how they compare with the highest performing schools in Asia and Europe. OECD Pisa tests are used to measure and compare the educational standards of developed countries around the world. But from next year individual schools will be able to test their 15-year-old pupils in reading, maths and science. It will allow schools to see how their pupils rank against global standards. Education Minister Liz Truss said it was an "excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems". Essex County Council said it is encouraging its schools to take part. Next month will see the publication of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development's (OECD) international league tables, based on Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests. These performance tables, which have become important international benchmarks, are published every three years, based on tests taken by a sample of schools in each country. The OECD says that such school standards are an important indicator for future economic performance. Asian countries have dominated the top places in recent test results, with Scandinavian countries among the high flyers in Europe. The UK has been a middle ranking performer, but within this national figure there will be a wide range of differences in ability, depending on region and type of school. It has raised questions such as how cities such as London might compare with New York or Paris, if there was data beyond the national level. The OECD is now going to allow individual schools in England to take the tests, so that they can see whether they are as good as pupils in Shanghai, Hong Kong or Finland, or whether they are falling behind the global competition. Making the test available will "enable individual schools in England for the first time to see where they stand internationally", says the OECD's education chief, Andreas Schleicher. "This will help teachers and school leaders understand where to focus their efforts to raise standards and learn from successful school systems in other countries." Schools will be given an overall test score, rather than a breakdown of individual pupils. And the school scores, from tests that take about two and a half hours, will not be published by the OECD. The test papers will be marked externally. Earlier this year this type of individual school testing was announced for the United States. Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said: "It is down to secondary schools themselves to decide whether they want to take part in these tests run by a highly respected, independent organisation. "We see this is an excellent opportunity for schools to compare themselves against the world's best education systems - and potentially against other schools from around the world." Ray Gooding, Essex County Council's cabinet member for education, said: "I will actively be encouraging Essex schools to take part to benefit from the ability to assess performance, share best practice and improve learning across the county." </body>

A letter to the county council follows inspections of 33 schools in September, prompted by concerns about overall education standards. Ofsted said there had been no overall increase in the number of good or outstanding schools in Suffolk. Suffolk County Council said recent Key Stage 2 and GCSE results showed it was "making progress". The council said its Raising The Bar programme had been designed to boost achievement in schools, but Ofsted found it was "regarded with varying degrees of credibility" by head teachers. The initiative was introduced in 2012 to try and improve standards, as figures revealed the county performed worse than comparable local education authorities (LEAs). The latest league tables showed that, out of 150 LEAS, Suffolk was in the bottom 10 for GCSE results and third from bottom for primary school performance. Ofsted said in its inspection of 33 schools in September, nearly a fifth were judged to be inadequate. Sean Harford, Ofsted regional director, said: "This is unacceptable and now means that Suffolk has a higher proportion of pupils educated in inadequate schools than both the regional and national averages. "The lack of progress of previously 'satisfactory' schools means that pupils in these schools still do not have access to a good quality of education. "This will be of great concern to parents, carers and pupils alike." Ofsted said that the number of schools that had improved to 'good' or 'better' had gone up, but not at the pace as the rest of the country. Inspectors found there were examples of effective intervention by the LEA, but it was "equally clear" some intervention had not been early enough. Last month, Suffolk County Council said it was going to approve a £2.4m spending package as part of its Raising the Bar school improvement policy. Ofsted said it also carried out a survey of head teachers of good or outstanding schools and its findings showed that, although they were aware of Raising The Bar, opinion was split on its credibility. Some head teachers said they had not been approached about playing a role in supporting other schools. Graham White, National Union of Teachers branch secretary for Suffolk, said: "Teaching standards are OK. "However, there are always going to be some that are really good and some that are less good. "We've got some outstanding teachers, heads and advisors in Suffolk, but we need to use them to much better effect." Ben Gummer, Conservative MP for Ipswich, said it was a "very helpful intervention" by Ofsted. "The same system of targets exists across the country and it has not stopped other areas improving more quickly than Suffolk," he said. "There are some exceptional teachers and good practice needs to be spread to the rest and that has to happen now rather than spread over a couple of years." A Suffolk County Council spokesperson said: "Improving educational attainment in Suffolk is the county council's top priority. "We're focused on making sure every child in Suffolk has the opportunity to fulfil their potential, which includes going to a good or outstanding school. "Through our Raising the Bar programme, we're working with and challenging schools to drive up educational attainment. "The latest Key Stage 2 and GCSE results show that Suffolk is making progress in the direction." </body>

      <body>Many parents fear music videos have become too sexualised and violent, the founder of a parenting website has said. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, said parents were not prudes, but felt things had "gone too far". In a survey of some 1,500 website members, most (82%) said their children had repeated sexual lyrics without knowing their meaning. And three-quarters said they tried to stop children watching music videos. Ms Freegard said parents were most angry that their children were being exposed to "lewd viewing" on programmes shown before the 21:00 watershed for family viewing. "Modern parents aren't prudes - they know sex sells," she said. "But there's a strong feeling that things have gone too far now. It's toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to." Most (75%) of parents with daughters said very sexual pop acts were teaching girls they would be "judged on their looks, not their achievements or personality". About half of parents with sons said they were frightened explicit footage made them believe women were "too sexually available" and that they should have "unrealistic porn-star-style body shapes". About 1,500 members of the website opted to take part in the online survey last month, shortly after an outcry over the latest music video and performances by Miley Cyrus. The Irish singer Sinead O'Connor recently warned the former children's TV star not to let herself be exploited by the music business, sparking a row between the pair. Two-thirds of parents taking part said they thought young female singers were being exploited. Defending a recent controversial performance, Miley Cyrus said people were "over-thinking" what she had done and that she had been trying to "make history". </body>

      <title>Academy chains 'should face Ofsted'</title>
      <description>A report from the Education Select Committee says Ofsted should be given powers to inspect sponsors of groups of academies.</description>

      <body>Ofsted should be given powers to inspect organisations that run chains of academies, says a report from a cross-party committee of MPs. The Education Select Committee wants to improve the way groups of schools work together in partnerships. More than half of secondary schools in England are now academies, operating outside local authority control. Graham Stuart, committee chairman, said schools needed clearer incentives to "look beyond their own school gate". Ofsted chief Sir Michael Wilshaw has previously said he believes that sponsors of such academy chains should face inspections. A Department for Education spokesman said: "Ofsted already inspects all school and academy performance, while the Department for Education examines the performance of chains. "Where academies are underperforming, we take action - this can involve issuing a pre-warning notice and ultimately changing the sponsor if there is no improvement." The report by MPs has examined partnerships and co-operation between schools, against a background of greater school autonomy and different levels of accountability. Mr Stuart says his committee supports giving schools "more freedom to innovate" but there also needs to be a "degree of co-ordination". "Otherwise there is a danger that many schools will operate in isolation rather than in co-operation," said Mr Stuart. The report says that while there is widespread support for the idea of raising standards through greater collaboration there is still a lack of incentive for schools to work together. It argues that local authorities have a "critical role" in improving schools and calls on the government to clarify how they can act as brokers between local schools. But with the expansion of academies, it says that academy chains will play an increasingly important part in helping schools to improve. It warns of the need for co-ordination from this "middle tier", between individual schools and central government, particularly in areas where schools are at risk of underperforming. The Education Select Committee MPs say that academy chains should be open to inspection by Ofsted, in the way that local authorities can be inspected. The committee also argues there should be a mechanism to allow outstanding schools to leave academy chains, including without the approval of the organisation running the chain. The MPs also raise concerns that some outstanding academies are not providing support for weaker neighbouring schools and the report calls for closer monitoring. Sir Michael Wilshaw, giving evidence to the committee earlier this year, told MPs that there needed to be a level playing field in the accountability of organisations running groups of schools. "We will be inspecting local authorities and we should inspect academy chains as well, if we identify underperformance," said the Ofsted chief. "I have made that clear to the secretary of state. It is only fair and equitable that we do that. We have not got the same powers at the moment, but I look forward to receiving the powers to do that." Sir Michael told MPs that there was an "ongoing discussion" with the Department for Education, but he thought the principle had been accepted. He also backed the idea that academy chains could be ranked in performance tables in the same way as local authorities. There are now 3,444 academies, representing 53% of secondary schools and 9% of primaries in England. Among these there are 1,600 schools in academy chains, up from fewer than 900 in autumn 2012. "Hundreds of schools are now collaborating on a scale never witnessed before - brilliant heads and teachers are working together, sharing best practice and driving improvement throughout the system, raising standards for their pupils," said a Department for Education spokesman. Labour's schools minister Kevin Brennan said: "Labour has long argued that collaboration between schools is what is needed if we are to deliver a step-change in standards across all schools. In June, we said that all schools would have to demonstrate effective collaboration with weaker schools for them to be rated as outstanding by Ofsted. "This report - by a cross-party group of MPs - is a damning indictment of David Cameron's schools policy that drives competition between schools instead of incentivising partnerships between them." </body>

      <title>Facebook sex teacher struck off</title>
      <description>A female drama teacher is banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex and having 'inappropriate and sexually explicit' conversations with other children.</description>

      <body>A female drama teacher has been banned from teaching after asking a pupil for sex. Lindsay Black, 28, sent texts, emails and Facebook messages to the boy, 17, who played a lead role in the school play "We Will Rock You". She asked him to meet up for sex after class at St Joseph's Roman Catholic High School, Newport. The disciplinary panel in Cardiff heard she had "inappropriate and sexually explicit" talks with other pupils. Miss Black asked her sixth form class "Who's a virgin?" and made pupils stand-up if they had not had sex. She also played a game called "I have never" with the pupils where she would ask them if they had performed sex acts. The hearing was told Miss Black then encouraged the teenagers to mime sex acts in class. The schoolboy, known as Pupil A, showed other pupils text messages from Miss Black as he rehearsed. English teacher Abigail Watts said: "I heard comments from other pupils about Miss Black liking pupils and I asked what this meant. "They said she had been Facebook messaging Pupil A - she told him she had a dream about them having sex. "They had not met up but they had been talking about it." Trained actress Miss Black met the teenager while working on maternity cover at the school. She contacted him on Facebook and asked about his coursework, then began sending him messages talking about sex and alcohol. A Professional Conduct Committee of the General Teaching Council of Wales heard she even asked the boy's girlfriend about their relationship. The hearing was told how Miss Black would spend time in classes talking to the students about sex acts. When Miss Black was confronted by the head of drama she told him it was just an exercise to get them into "character". Colleague Sandra Davies said: "Pupils told me that during drama classes Miss Black would talk about sex and she turned the lessons on to a sexual theme. "She said she wanted to cheat on her fiance once before getting married and that she fantasised about having sex on a table in the drama class." Ms Davies added the pupils played the "I have never" game. "She would then get the pupils to act out the acts in question," she added. The hearing in Cardiff was told how the boy's academic performance had suffered as a result of the messages and he had to re-sit his AS levels. Ms Black was interviewed by police following the allegations in 2011 but no further action was taken. She did not attend the hearing but admitted engaging in inappropriate and sexually explicit conversations with a pupil via social networking website Facebook. Ms Black denied talking to her class about sex and said the pupils had made up the allegations. But the panel found she had held discussions of an "inappropriate and sexually explicit nature" with Year 12 children. The panel found her actions amounted to unacceptable professional conduct and banned her from teaching. Committee chairman Peter Williams said: "The conduct in question seriously affected pupils and was not an isolated lapse. "Black's actions are fundamentally incompatible with being a registered teacher." Paul Bennett, chair of governors at St Joseph's, said the school took allegations of unprofessional conduct "very seriously". He added: "The allegations were handled in line with the appropriate procedures. The school referred the matter to the General Teaching Council for Wales as it was required to do." </body>

      <title>Autism detectable 'in first months'</title>
      <description>Signs of autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Autism can be identified in babies as young as two months, early research suggests. US researchers analysed how infants looked at faces from birth to the age of three. They found children later diagnosed with autism had shown diminished eye contact - a hallmark of autism - in the first few months of life. The findings, reported in Nature, raised hope for early interventions to tackle autism, said a UK expert. In the study, researchers led by Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta used eye-tracking technology to measure the way babies looked at and responded to social clues. They found infants later diagnosed with autism had shown a steady decline in attention to the eyes of other people from the age of two months onwards, when watching videos of natural human interactions. Lead researcher Dr Warren Jones told BBC News: "It tells us for the first time that it's possible to detect some signs of autism in the first months of life. "These are the earliest signs of autism that we've ever observed." The study, in collaboration with the Marcus Autism Center and Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, followed 59 infants who had a high risk of autism because they had siblings with the life-long disability, and 51 infants at low risk. Dr Jones and colleague Dr Ami Klin followed them to the age of three, when the children were formally assessed for autism. Thirteen of the children were diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders - a range of disorders that includes autism and Asperger's syndrome - 11 boys and two girls. The researchers then went back to look at the eye-tracking data, and what they found was surprising. "In infants with autism, eye contact is declining already in the first six months of life," said Dr Jones. But he added this could be seen only with sophisticated technology and would not be visible to parents. "It's not something that parents would be able to see by themselves at all. If parents have concerns they should talk to their paediatrician." Dr Deborah Riby, of the department of psychology at Durham University, said the study provided an insight into the timing of atypical social attention in children who might go on to develop autism. "These early markers are extremely important for us to identify - the earlier we can diagnose a child who has one of these disorders - such as autism - the earlier we can provide intervention and development," she said. Caroline Hattersley, head of information, advice and advocacy at the National Autistic Society, said the research was "based on a very small sample and needs to be replicated on a far larger scale before any concrete conclusions can be drawn". "Autism is a very complex condition," she said. "No two people with autism are the same, and so a holistic approach to diagnosis is required that takes into account all aspects of an individual's behaviour. A more comprehensive approach allows all of a person's support needs to be identified. "It's vital that everyone with autism can access a diagnosis, as it can be key to unlocking the right support which can enable people with the condition to reach their full potential." The research is published in the journal Nature. </body>

      <title>A second language may delay dementia</title>
      <description>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual.</description>

      <body>People who speak more than one language and who develop dementia tend to do so up to five years later than those who are monolingual, according to a study. Scientists examined almost 650 dementia patients and assessed when each one had been diagnosed with the condition. They found people who spoke two or more languages experienced a later onset of Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and frontotemporal dementia. The bilingual advantage extended to illiterate people. The scientists said it confirmed the observed effect was not caused by differences in formal education. The study was by Edinburgh University and Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences in Hyderabad in India. It is the largest study so far to gauge the impact of bilingualism on the onset of dementia, independent of a person's education, gender, occupation and whether they live in a city or in the country, all of which have been examined as potential factors influencing the onset of dementia. The team of researchers said further studies were needed to determine the mechanism, which causes the delay in the onset of dementia. The researchers suggested bilingual switching between different sounds, words, concepts, grammatical structures and social norms constituted a form of natural brain training, which was likely to be more effective than any artificial brain training programme. However, studies of bilingualism are complicated in that bilingual populations are often ethnically and culturally different from monolingual societies. In places like Hyderabad, bilingualism is part of everyday life, knowledge of several languages is the norm and monolingualism is an exception. Thomas Bak, of Edinburgh University's school of philosophy, psychology and language sciences said: "These findings suggest that bilingualism might have a stronger influence on dementia than any currently available drugs. "This makes the study of the relationship between bilingualism and cognition one of our highest priorities." The study is published in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. </body>

      <title>Music lessons 'sculpt the brain'</title>
      <description>Learning a musical instrument as a child confers brain gains that last long into adult life, according to a small study.</description>

      <body>Learning a musical instrument as a child gives the brain a boost that lasts long into adult life, say scientists. Adults who used to play an instrument, even if they have not done so in decades, have a faster brain response to speech sounds, research suggests. The more years of practice during childhood, the faster the brain response was, the small study found. The Journal of Neuroscience work looked at 44 people in their 50s, 60s and 70s. The volunteers in the study listened to a synthesised speech syllable, "da", while researchers measured electrical activity in the region of the brain that processes sound information - the auditory brainstem. Despite none of the study participants having played an instrument in nearly 40 years, those who completed between four and 14 years of music training early in life had a faster response to the speech sound than those who had never been taught music. The study took place at the Auditory Neuroscience Laboratory at Northwestern University in Illinois, US. As people grow older, they often experience changes in the brain that compromise hearing. For instance, the brains of older adults show a slower response to fast-changing sounds, which is important for interpreting speech. It could be that learning an instrument in childhood causes a fixed change in the brain that is retained throughout life. Or, music classes somehow prepare the brain for future auditory learning, say the researchers. Past work by the same team found younger adults were better listeners if they had been taught an instrument as a child. Experts also believe musical training - with an emphasis on rhythmic skills - can exercise the auditory-system. But these studies are all relatively small and cannot ascertain if it is definitely musical training that is causing the effect. Arguably, children offered the opportunity to learn an instrument, which can be expensive, may come from more privileged backgrounds and this may have an influence. Commenting on the study, Michael Kilgard from the University of Texas, who was not involved with the research, said: "Being a millisecond faster may not seem like much, but the brain is very sensitive to timing and a millisecond compounded over millions of neurons can make a real difference in the lives of older adults." </body>

      <body>Lack of detail in the government's figures for its teacher training plans for next year may hide possible teacher shortages, claims a university expert. Figures published last Friday lack crucial details, says James Noble-Rogers of the Universities Council for the Education of Teachers (UCET). Mr Rogers says he fears such details may reveal key shortages of trainees. The government said it planned to publish a detailed breakdown of the figures "in the next few weeks". Mr Rogers has issued a freedom of information request to the government for the data. He says Friday's figures failed to give details of how the government has allocated numbers by subject or of how many trainee places have been allocated for secondary or primary education. "This information has been published as a matter of course in the past", he writes in a letter to the schools minister, David Laws. "It should not be necessary in an open democracy for UCET or anyone else to resort to legislation to obtain information of this kind." Last week's figures revealed how many teachers the government plans to train next year. They also showed a further switch in funding for teacher training from universities to the School Direct scheme which allows teachers to learn largely on the job in schools, but with theoretical and specialist training provided by universities. The figures showed that 41,100 teachers would be trained in the year starting September 2014, rising from 38,900 this year. Of these the numbers trained by Schools Direct will rise from 9,600 in the current academic year to 15,400 in 2014. The numbers trained on postgraduate university courses will fall from 20,000 this year to 16,200 next year. Overall, Mr Rogers says this represents a rise in the numbers trained by School Direct from 25% to 37%. A Department for Education spokeswoman said that detailed allocations, including a breakdown by subject, would be published within the next few weeks "once they have been confirmed by universities and schools. "School Direct has built on many excellent long-standing relationships between schools and universities. "We want these relationships to continue to give applicants plenty of choice about their preferred route into teaching. "Higher education institutions are involved in seven in 10 School Direct places "We hit 95% of our recruitment target this year." The spokeswoman added that three candidates applied for every School Direct place last year, and that requests from schools for School Direct places had "shot up from 9,600 to 17,700 in the past year". Mr Rogers told BBC News said the broken down data was usually issued at the same time as the overall figures. He said the delay this year would make it difficult for training providers, particularly universities, to plan. "The only apparent reason it should now be kept secret is to prevent a timely and legitimate analysis of data before allocations are finalised", says the letter to Mr Laws. In August, analysis of School Direct recruitment figures by Prof John Howson of Oxford Brookes University suggested a possible shortfall in the numbers of science and maths specialists. </body>

      <title>Two-year-olds 'should start school'</title>
      <description>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged backgrounds should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested.</description>

      <body>Two-year-olds from disadvantaged families should be enrolled in school nurseries to improve their chances, the chairwoman of Ofsted has suggested. Many children from poor backgrounds have a "dire" start to their education, according to Baroness Sally Morgan. They can be up to a year and a half behind their better-off classmates by the age of five, she said. The Pre-School Learning Alliance described Lady Morgan's suggestion as "beyond belief". "Who would disagree with Sally Morgan that children from disadvantaged backgrounds need considerably more support. However, to suggest that placing two and three-year-olds in schools is the answer is beyond belief. "Social inequality needs to addressed in many ways and taking very young children away from their parents and placing them in formal schooling is not the answer," said Alliance chief executive Neil Leitch. Mr Leitch added that international research put the UK's specialist early years network of childminders and nurseries among the world's best. "I am struggling to understand why anyone would promote pushing our youngest, most vulnerable children into schools rather than using the existing network of specialist local provision offered by childminders and group settings," he said. The government said it was making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two. Speaking at an event organised by an academy chain, Lady Morgan argued that poor parenting, poor diet and poor housing meant disadvantaged children were often not ready to start formal schooling at five. She called for a "big brave move" in early years education, with more nurseries attached to schools and a particular focus on the poorest children. She said more schools should become "all through", taking pupils from age three or younger to age 18. Her comments echo a recent Ofsted report which suggested that poor five-year-olds are 19 months behind their more affluent peers. "What a dire start to their educational life," said Lady Morgan. "Those children had low level social skills especially reading and communication. "They're not ready to learn at school. Weak parenting, low educational attainment of parents, poor diet, poor housing and so on. "The gap between affluent and disadvantaged is greatest in that group. "No-one has yet got a grip on this problem", she said. "I think there needs to be a big brave move on the under-fives agenda to target funding heavily on the children who will benefit most and increasingly, I think, to look to strong providers to go further down the system. We've increasingly got five-to-18 schools, why not three-to-18?" A Department for Education spokeswoman responded: "We know that teacher-led early years education has a positive impact on children, especially on those from low income backgrounds. "That is why we are making it easier for schools to take children from the age of two by removing the requirement on them to register separately with Ofsted when doing so, and introducing 15 hours of free early education for 240,000 of the poorest two-year-olds." The spokeswoman said government reforms would ensure all children, regardless of background, get a good start in life with all three- and four-year-olds entitled to 15 hours a week of free early education. Educational Psychologist Dr Jo van Herwegen of Kingston University said formal learning risked damaging children's development if started too early. "It's really all about what you define as being 'school' education and the government needs to understand that children learn through play at this young age. "Formal learning is extremely difficult as children's working memory and language abilities are still developing, "Forcing children to learn in formal settings and sit tests regularly can risk creating performance anxiety and an aversion to learning later on in life". Wendy Ellyat of the Save Childhood Movement said the key was to "prioritise child-flourishing and well-being over educational attainment", whether children were with childminders or in schools or nurseries. "We also need to look at how best to support parents as the most important thing for such young children is to have stable, loving and supportive home lives." </body>

      <body>A leading university is offering up to 500 paid internships to undergraduates. The University of Leicester says they will be available to students based in the UK or EU starting degree courses in 2014 and will last up to 12 weeks each. The aim is to give students insight into what employers want from recruits and to compete in a global jobs market. "Crucially we want our students to be able to adapt to the challenges they face when they leave", said career development manager Raj Patel. The university says the scheme will be the first of its kind offered by any top-20 higher education institution in the UK. All the internships will pay the equivalent of £12,000 to £16,000 a year pro rata, says the university. Some will be within the university's own departments, others will be in the private sector. Bob Athwal, director of career development, said a growing number of employers were using student internships "to feed their talent pipeline". The new scheme will involve an application and selection process, with a programme of workshops to help students prepare. The university has promised the interview process will provide "every campus-based home or EU student with an opportunity during their degree". Mr Athwal says this idea is to showcase "a rich pool of talent" among Leicester undergraduates. The graduate jobs market has been tight in recent years. Figures produced by the Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR) in July this year forecast a 4% fall in graduate vacancies, with leading UK employers reporting an average of 85 applications for each job. A separate survey of more than 18,000 university leavers, published in June, suggested graduates who had had internships were three times more likely to get jobs. The study by High Fliers research found that more than one in three students had completed work experience or internships with a prospective employer. </body>

      <title>Forced academies 'costing too much'</title>
      <description>An internal document leaked to the BBC suggests ministers are prepared to force schools to become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits.</description>

      <body>Ministers are making struggling schools become academies even when the costs are disproportionate to the benefits, a leaked government document suggests. Civil servants planning for budget cuts at the education department suggested ministers consider value for money before forcing academy conversions. But Education Secretary Michael Gove overruled this cash-saving idea as "totally wrong", the document reveals. The education department says academies are the best way of improving schools. But the National Union of Teachers said Mr Gove's "pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost". Academies are privately run schools funded by the state in England. They have control over their own admissions, and increased freedoms over what they teach and pay staff. They can get up to £110,000 in start-up costs. Where underperforming schools are unwilling to convert to academy status, it is enforced in several steps - including sacking the governors and replacing them with a hand-picked interim governing body. Ultimately the secretary of state can issue an academy order requiring a change in the school's management. The Department for Education (DfE) sees the academies programme as its key engine of school improvement, but critics have described the process as heavy-handed and undemocratic. The DfE plans to cut its administrative budget by £290m by 2015-16. The document, entitled What Stops at the DfE, looks at where savings could be made. It says forced conversions are "very resource intensive" and reveals that the government's underperformance strategy is in need of extra funds. But despite tight department budgets, it is clear that conversions where the costs outweigh the benefits - often where there is strong opposition to a change - are still being pushed through. The document suggests more account should be taken of a "cost-benefit analysis" in "determining the approach to academisation of underperforming schools". But it stresses that the secretary of state does not want to see such value-for-money checks on the programme and that the changes have not been made. It adds that ministers had expected to see some schools or heads change their mind about becoming academies as a result of high profile cases such as that of Downhills Primary School, which it cites as an example. Mr Gove ordered the Haringey school be taken over by an academy chain, despite 94% of parents opposing the move, and claims that it was already on a trajectory of improvement when the conversion was being proposed. Legal action was threatened as a result and teachers walked out on strike. But the document says: "Achieving success in difficult areas has a bigger potential pay-off and is important for the reputation and reach of the overall programme but both this and forced conversions are very resource intensive." And it warns: "If we limit the number of forced interventions there is a risk that we don't tackle the worst performing schools (which would not otherwise become academies)." It is also clear that the DfE is seeking extra cash to ensure the forced academies programme is maintained. It talks about "securing the additional resource needed for the underperformance strategy" and says it will not place "any arbitrary limits on forced conversion activity". And indeed the document is peppered with references to how money can be transferred from the oversight of maintained schools so that the "increasing stock of academies and free schools can be managed". At the same time work on a new admissions code, which the document says might prove inevitable because of various pressures, has been axed. And oversight of boarding schools and home education is being downgraded despite civil servant warnings that there could be child protection risks as a result. A DfE spokesman said: "Ministers are clear we will not stand by when a school is failing its pupils, and that the strong support of a proven sponsor is the best way to see rapid and sustainable improvements. "While it is vital that government constantly considers ways to cut bureaucracy and save public money, we make no apology for prioritising improving the education of children in the country's worst performing schools." National Union of Teachers general secretary Christine Blower said: "Despite civil servants identifying the forced academy programme as an activity that could be cut back in order to address the disproportionate cost to the public purse, this document makes clear that ideology won out over sound public policy decision making. "It is increasingly evident that Michael Gove's pet policies are driving the education agenda at any cost. "At a time when school budgets elsewhere are being cut is really quite an inappropriate use of public finances." David Simmonds, of the Local Government Association, said: "In many cases, giving more flexibility to local areas to take swift action, for instance by recruiting new governors and staff, would be a better and more cost effective way of improving standards. "Councils want to be able to intervene more quickly and effectively in poorly performing schools but are hampered by excessive bureaucracy. "Money spent on conversion costs could be saved by enabling earlier intervention by councils who are focused on school performance rather than management structures." </body>

      <body>Three single mothers and their children have lost a legal challenge to the government's benefit cap. Judges ruled that regulations brought in by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith were lawful and did not breach human rights. The £500-a-week cap affects housing benefit, child benefit and child tax credit for families not working enough hours to get working tax credit. The government said it was "very pleased" at the High Court's ruling. The cap, introduced in July in England, Scotland and Wales, is set at the same level for couples or single parents. Lawyers acting for three mothers and one child from each family, all from the London area, said the "cruel and arbitrary" measure was "reminiscent of the days of the workhouse", and the women feared it would leave them destitute. They argued the cap unlawfully breached the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for home and family life. The legal challenge was supported by the Child Poverty Action Group and the Women's Aid Federation. Dismissing their claim for judicial review, Lord Justice Elias and Mr Justice Bean said that no doubt many considered the cap to be "too parsimonious". They ruled: "But that is ultimately a policy issue, and for the reasons we have given we do not think it can be said that the scheme is so manifestly unfair or disproportionate as to justify an interference by the courts." A Department for Work and Pensions spokesman said: "We are very pleased that the court has ruled that the benefit cap complies with the European Convention on Human Rights. "The benefit cap sets a fair limit to what people can expect to get from the welfare system - so that claimants cannot receive more than £500 a week, the average household earnings." </body>

      <title>Engineering gap 'constrains' economy</title>
      <description>The UK's economic recovery could be constrained by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser.</description>

      <body>The UK's economic recovery could be "constrained" by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser. Prof John Perkins, chief scientific adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has identified "a substantial demand for engineers". He has issued "a call to action" to government, industry and educators to "step up" to inspire future engineering talent and address skills shortages. Business Secretary Vince Cable said too few teenagers were studying science. "Engineers must have a strong foundation in maths and science, especially physics. "The number of young people choosing these subjects post-16 is relatively low, especially amongst women," said Mr Cable. In his Review of Engineering Skills, Prof Perkins says the UK already relies on "inward migration" to fill skilled jobs in key sectors such as oil and gas extraction, aerospace, and computer, electronic and optical engineering. "This should not be our long-term solution. "We should support the UK's young people by preparing them to compete for highly paid, skilled engineering jobs, improving their career prospects and reducing the need to import engineering skills," says the review. It calls for "purposeful and effective early intervention to enthuse tomorrow's engineers" and ensure they have the "solid academic foundations to engage in the subject". The report calls for as many young people as possible to study "rigorous curricula in maths and science". In particular it says the UK lags behind its competitors in the number of 16- to 18-year-olds studying maths. Prof Perkins says the profession suffers "from widespread misconceptions and lack of visibility that deter young people, and especially girls from pursuing it as a career". The report refers to polling carried out for the Tomorrow's Engineers Week campaign, which suggests that only half of 11- to 14-year olds would consider a career in engineering. This dropped to 35% among girls and only 24% of parents of girls said they thought engineering was a suitable profession for their daughters. Prof Perkins draws "some comfort that we are heading in the right direction" with initiatives to inspire future engineers, a focus on maths and science in schools, more apprenticeships and "our continued strength in higher education". His 22 recommendations urge both short and long term action to "get the right messages to young people" - particularly girls, to ensure vocational training is high quality and high status and that "higher education continues to deliver". The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it was making available nearly £49m to boost engineering skills. From January some £30m of this money will allow employers to bid for match-funding for training schemes to address specific engineering skills shortages. Another £18m will fund an elite training facility in Coventry, while Tomorrow's Engineers will get £250,000 to encourage schoolchildren into engineering. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, which represents almost 6,000 companies, said: "The report rightly shines the spotlight on the need for a pipeline of talented future engineers, with credible recommendations on how this can be achieved. "Whilst this is a long-term task, the message from employers is clear - we are ready to take on the challenge." Anne Spackman of the charity Career Academies which runs internship schemes to prepare schoolchildren for employment said efforts to "grow the number of potential recruits" into engineering were crucial. "Engineering is an area rich in job opportunities but lacking the skilled workers to fill them," said Ms Spackman. </body>

      <title>London online course draws 200,000</title>
      <description>The first annual figures from a UK online course show a high initial take-up, but also a high dropout rate.</description>

      <body>More than 200,000 students signed up for the first wave of online courses offered by the University of London's International Programmes. The university has published details of the take-up of four online courses - so-called Moocs - in their first year. This also showed the high dropout rate with only about 9,000 students completing a course. Mike Kerrison, director of academic development, said the the experiment so far had been "very successful". The University of London's International Programmes specialises in providing degrees by distance learning and has been providing such courses since the 19th Century. Last year it became one of the UK's early adopters of so-called Moocs - massive open online courses - which deliver university courses through the internet. It offered free courses through the US-based Coursera network, which now has more than five million registrations. This snapshot from the University of London's International Programmes at the end of the first year shows the scale of interest in such online courses, with 210,000 students signing up. Reflecting the demand for higher education, this is about four times the total number of conventional students studying with the University of London's International Programmes. Among those people who signed up, 90,000 were categorised as "active students" who participated in one of the four pilot courses, which were about computer programming, law, malicious software and the use of photography. The university says there was a strong sense of value from students, with 91% rating their experience as good, very good or excellent. These online courses, with no formal entry requirements, have a high dropout rate, and in this case there were 8,843 students who received a "Statement of Accomplishment" for successful completion, fewer than one in 20 of those who initially signed up. "Considering that the courses are free and allow students to do as much or as little work as they like, the number of students engaging in the course materials is considerable," said Mr Kerrison. There has been particular interest in online universities in the US, where prestigious institutions such as Harvard, MIT and Stanford have been at the forefront of creating online platforms such as Coursera and edX. These have also spread into international networks with major recent partnerships in China and France. The online model has also begun to be refined, with Harvard developing courses for a much smaller, pre-selected group of online students, with the aim of much higher completion rates. These have been dubbed Spocs, small private online courses. This autumn also saw the launch of a UK online university partnership, Futurelearn, which has announced new courses starting in January, bringing to 29 the total number of courses available. This includes Shakespeare's Hamlet: text, performance and culture, from the University of Birmingham and Exploring our oceans, from the University of Southampton. So far Futurelearn has attracted students from 190 countries with five of the pilot courses already reaching their planned quotas. Chief executive Simon Nelson said the response in this first term had "exceeded all our expectations". </body>

      <title>Not reporting abuse 'must be crime'</title>
      <description>Teachers and other professionals who fail to report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the former director of public prosecutions says.</description>

      <body>Teachers and other professionals who do not report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the ex-director of public prosecutions says. Keir Starmer said under a British "mandatory reporting" law, those who failed to act could be sent to jail. Declassified files uncovered by BBC Panorama show how schools have repeatedly failed to protect children from sex offenders. But the government said mandatory reporting was not the answer. While statutory guidance has been issued previously urging professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report child abuse, failure to do so is not a crime in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1967 makes it an offence to fail to disclose an arrestable offence - including those against children - to police. Mr Starmer, who was succeeded as director of public prosecutions by Alison Saunders on Friday, said it was time to "plug a gap in the law" that had been there for a "very, very long time". "If you're in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, and you have cause to believe that a child has been abused, or is about to be abused, you really ought to do something about it," he said. He said a criminal penalty would "focus people's minds" and said there should be "immunity for individuals if they did report". He said the penalty for failing to report abuse could be a short jail sentence or a fine. "There are just too many examples of cases where those who have suspected abuse have not really done anything about it and the perpetrator has either got away with it or, worse still, been able to perpetuate the offending." He added: "I would have a reasonably broad category of individuals that were subject to the law. "Obviously school teachers, but others in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, including other educational institutions, even sporting institutions." Similar laws are already in places in countries including the US, Canada and Australia. For the first time, the Catholic Church and the Church of England have also come out in support of mandatory reporting. Bishop Paul Butler, head of safeguarding at the Church of England, said: "We have to think of the child first, not ourselves, not the institution, what's best for the child." But the government has no plans to change the law. The Department for Education said professionals "should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child". "This happens every year in many thousands of cases and numbers of referrals have increased over recent years," it added. "Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children." And Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the Action for Children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are not convinced that making it mandatory will do what we need it to do." She said the reporting of child abuse in the UK was on the rise and that a "huge issue" was that "teachers and people across the system are not sufficiently trained to see those early signs of abuse". It was important they knew how to spot those signs "and not to feel that they may be prosecuted if they don't", she added. But Jonathan West, of the Mandate Now coalition of charities, welcomed Mr Starmer's call, adding that "social services can't actually act on cases they haven't been told about". He added: "Schools, other organisations, often don't really want to have a child abuse scandal on their hands. "It is surprisingly common that schools want to handle such things in house." Ever since the Jimmy Savile revelations, Panorama has been investigating secret historical records and looking at what government officials knew about abuse in children's homes and boarding schools. Declassified government files going back 60 years show how senior civil servants were well aware that school authorities routinely hid child abuse - preferring instead to protect the reputation of their own institutions - and the law was an inadequate deterrent. One of the most detailed historical files in the National Archives is about a cover-up at the Royal Alexandra and Albert school. Today it is a well-regarded state boarding school in Reigate, Surrey. However, research by Panorama has revealed that seven child abusers worked at the school between the 1950s and the 1980s.

      <description>Exams regulator Ofqual confirms it is making changes to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation.</description>

      <body>Exams regulator Ofqual has confirmed the changes it is making to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. A new grading system will use numbers instead of letters, and coursework is being scrapped for most subjects. The changes will be in stages, starting with pupils due to take GCSE exams in 2017. Those who turn 13 in this academic year will be the first. English and maths will be the first subjects affected. Pupils will begin studying the new courses in English language, English literature and maths from the autumn of 2015. And about 20 other popular GCSE subjects will be revamped in the same way, ready for teaching a year later, in 2016, with the first exams for those taken in 2018. The changes apply to England only. Wales is planning its own GCSE shake-up, but Northern Ireland is not planning any changes. Scotland has its own exams system. While they come in, pupils in England will have some exams graded with numbers and some with letters, leading teaching unions to warn this will be confusing for pupils, parents and employers. Exams will be graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest. Pupils who fail will be awarded a "U" for an unclassified result. All exams will be taken after two years of study, rather than in modules taken at various stages over two years, meaning a return to the format of O-levels, which pre-dated GCSEs. And there will be more marks awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar. The head of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said the changes were "fundamental". "This is the biggest change in a generation," she said. "They [GCSEs] have been around for over 25 years but now we are seeing fresh content, a different structure, high-quality assessment coming in. "It's a significant change for students and for schools." Ms Stacey said the move to a numerical system meant a new grade was being added and that would help examiners distinguish between candidates' performance - especially at the top grades. She suggested that the move away from traditional grades might be hard for some people to understand, but was important. "The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly," she said. At the same time, the government is confirming changes to what has to be studied in English language, English literature and maths, because the overhaul of exams covers both what is studied and how it is assessed. It says in English literature, students will have to "study whole texts in detail, covering a range of literature including Shakespeare, 19th Century novels, Romantic poetry and other high-quality fiction and drama". The new maths exam will cover more topics and will be more challenging, the government says. Details were released on Friday morning. For maths, Ofqual is keeping the present arrangement where pupils can be entered for either a higher- or lower-tier paper in maths, depending on their ability. But in English, that division has been scrapped and one exam will be taken by all. At the moment, students who are entered for easier papers can be awarded only the maximum of a C grade. The government says young people were let down by the old exam system; that frequent testing meant not enough time was spent on "deep learning" and not enough attention was paid to grammar, spelling and punctuation. Schools Minister Elizabeth Truss says the changes will improve students' "core skills" in maths and English and raise expectations. "What we want to do is encourage schools to focus on those core skills that employers really want, because that is what is going to help our children get jobs when they leave school," she said. Headteachers' representative, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), gave what it said was a "cautious welcome" to the changes. Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said: "There is much to welcome in today's announcement, especially the measured approach Ofqual has taken to this significant task. "We have always agreed that GCSE can be improved to better prepare students to meet the needs of the world we live in today. But the constant tinkering with GCSEs we have had in the past has not been helpful." Unions representing classroom teachers warned that a shift away from coursework and having different levels of exams for different abilities could damage some pupils' education. Secondary school teacher and spokesman for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Jovan Trkulja, said that less able students could suffer. "Exams are challenging and they should continue to be challenging. But we have to remember that setting the top of the mountain as the baseline means someone has to fall behind, and I feel for the sense of failure for the less able," he said. Shadow schools minister, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, said he had "reservations" about some aspects of the changes and that the move towards a numbered grading system was a step back to the 1970s. He said he agreed that the pendulum "might have swung a little too far on coursework", but there was now a danger that "it will swing too far the other way". "Having everything staked on one final exam is not great for all pupils," he said. </body>

      <title>Council tracks school-run on CCTV</title>
      <description>A London council is thought to be the first local authority to confirm it uses CCTV cameras to spot illegal school run parking.</description>

      <body>A north London council has confirmed it is using CCTV cameras to target parents who park illegally on the school run. Enfield Council has set up cameras outside schools that record number plates of cars parked illegally for more than three seconds. The system's manufacturers say other boroughs are also trialling the system, but did not confirm which ones. Local authorities say the cameras will improve safety but opponents say it is just a way of raising money. The data is recorded and reported back to councils and either a warning letter can be issued or a penalty fine. Paul Pearson, of parking campaign group Penalty Charge Notice, said there was not enough places for parents to park. Alex Henney, the general secretary of the National Motorists' Action Group, said a civil enforcement officer should be used instead of the cameras. "It seems to me that probably there's an agenda to generate money - that is illegal," he said. "In my view, the sensible approach is to get the council and school head together to discuss it with the parents to sort out some arrangement." However, Amanda Philips, the head teacher at Old Ford Primary School in Tower Hamlets, east London, said the school had tried to address parking issues by communicating with families, the local council and the police but there is a problem. "It is as always a very small number of families with particular cars that we can identify that we constantly have conversations with," she said. Dave Richmond, the joint director of camera manufacturers Videalert, said he did not believe it would be a "cash cow" as once several tickets were issued, drivers would stop parking illegally. He said the problem with using civil enforcement officers is that drivers comply with the rules when an officer is present, but revert back to their normal behaviour when they have gone. "If you watch the videos that I have seen, some of the behaviour of drivers outside schools is like the Rocky Horror Show," Mr Richmond said. "It is really bad and therefore this is a safety issue and it needs to be dealt with." In a statement, Enfield Council said it was "committed to improving road safety for all pedestrians, especially children walking to and from school, and reducing road safety related casualties. "This is a pilot project and we will evaluate its success before making any decisions on future use," it said. </body>

      <title>'Raise tuition fees with inflation'</title>
      <description>University tuition fees should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged.</description>

      <body>University tuition fees in England should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged. Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey and president of Universities UK, says a £9,000 fee cap is "not sustainable". "The whole issue is that fees can't remain frozen for ever", he told Times Higher Education magazine. The National Union of Students (NUS) said last year's trebling in fees had already far outpaced rising costs. Sir Christopher's comments follow a recent call from the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Andrew Hamilton, for undergraduate fees to be "more closely related to the true cost" of a degree at Oxford, £16,000. Last month Prof Hamilton said the funding shortfall meant Oxford faced an annual funding gap of £70m. Sir Christopher said that Surrey had "several subjects where we are losing substantial sums of money teaching UK and EU students". He said these included science, technology and engineering courses. Sir Christopher added: "On aggregate the £9,000 was perhaps a reasonable starting point, but it really needs to have a sensible indexing linked to it." He said that the £9,000 maximum fees paid by students would be worth only around £8,250 by 2016 when inflation was factored in. However, Sir Christopher told the magazine that he was not an advocate of a major jump in fees: "I don't think that £16,000 is a likely scenario in the near future." Universities UK will publish a report next week on the future of university financing. This is expected to look at how universities will fund a predicted 26% rise in demand for university places within the next 20 years. Universities Minister David Willetts has said a rising birthrate will mean the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000. The paper is expected to explore where universities will find the capital to expand their facilities and accommodation. Universities UK points out that the rise in tuition fees paid by students was accompanied by a corresponding cut in the level of government funding for universities. The NUS said suggestions that undergraduates should pay more were unlikely to win sympathy from students or their parents. Union president Toni Pearce said: "What seems to have been missed here is the inflation-busting increases on the upper limit on tuition fees just last year, when the cap was nearly tripled to an eye-watering £9,000. "We've already seen a huge shift onto the shoulders of individuals through higher fees that far outpace rising costs. "Students and their families are facing a huge financial squeeze. The value of both earnings and student financial support is falling in real terms and the cost of making ends meet is increasing by the day." The government said its reforms had put the higher education sector on a more sustainable footing. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We believe the £9,000 fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching, with many institutions now planning to invest more in improved teaching facilities for students. "We want to ensure that going to university remains affordable for students and it is based on their ability, not their ability to pay." </body>

      <body>The University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) has received what it says is one of the biggest ever donations to a UK university. The £20m gift - worth more than a quarter of its annual turnover - would be "transformational", SOAS said. It came from the Alphawood Foundation in Chicago, set up by Fred Eychaner, a former Asian art student at SOAS. The money will pay for building upgrades, research and scholarships. Prof Paul Webley, director of SOAS, said the university was "thrilled" to be working with Alphawood. "SOAS has been studying and interpreting the development, languages, arts and cultures of Asia for nearly 100 years and this project will draw on that knowledge as well as further reinforce our position as a world-leading centre for the study and interpretation of South East Asian art." The donation includes £5m towards building development and £15m to be spent on research into South East Asian Art as well as improving links with the region. SOAS said the money would be used to bring post-graduate students from the south-east Asia to London. It also wants to establish three new academic posts, including professorships in Buddhist and Hindu art, and develop links with like-minded institutions in countries such as Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. Mr Eychaner, a broadcasting tycoon who owns a string of radio stations, said he wanted his money to build bridges, especially in areas of Asia held back in the 20th Century by war and politics. "Alphawood Foundation seeks to stimulate and expand the study of South East Asian art at all levels - from an educated and interested public to museum professionals to new PhD-level scholars. "We chose to advance this goal by making our largest gift to date to SOAS because this school creates a very special learning and research environment where West meets East." Mr Eychaner - who owned a television station until he sold it to Rupert Murdoch's Fox network - studied for a post-graduate diploma at SOAS, which currently has more than 5,000 students from 130 countries. </body>

      <title>How technology best boosts learning</title>

      <body>An inner city primary is at the heart of a project to test how technology can be used to boost children's learning. Rosendale Primary, in south London, won a £253,000 grant for the research which will involve 1,400 pupils in 24 schools in London, Essex and Manchester. Rosendale pupils use tablet computers to photograph their work and tag it with notes about how well they learned. The Lambeth school's head teacher, Kate Atkins, says the aim is to help pupils develop a range of learning strategies. "Poor learners are often over-confident about the power of their memories and can struggle to find alternative strategies. "We need to encourage them to think about how they learn and to try something else." Children at the school are encouraged to reflect on every piece of work or unit of learning. They are asked to think about which bits went well, what they struggled with and what they might need to do to improve when they next revisit the subject. A key part of this is to ask children how they felt about each piece of work, for example many children find conducting a science experiment exciting and fun but hate having to sit down and write it up afterwards, says Ms Atkins. "An emotional reaction is a key part of the learning process." The research project aims to test whether the strategy actually improves pupils' attainment. It will be tested at 24 two-form-entry schools, one form will carry on as normal, the other will record and reflect on their learning using digital note-taking. Children will be tested at the start and finish of the project to measure their abilities and the results evaluated at Manchester University. The project is one of seven in a £3.5m strategy by the Education Endowment Foundation and Nominet Trust to evaluate the impact of technology in schools . The charities say the aim is to "rigorously test" new ways to use technology to improve attainment, particularly of less advantaged children. The grants will support 18,000 pupils in 260 schools across England. Another project, centred on Shireland Collegiate Academy in Sandwell, West Midlands, will test the effectiveness of a "flipped learning" approach. In effect pupils do their homework before the lesson, watching a video or web presentation on a new concept the night before. The lesson itself then focuses on a more detailed exploration of the concept, perhaps experimentation or discussion, and on helping struggling pupils. Dan Sutch of the Nominet Trust said: "The more we can understand where technology best supports learning and teaching the better." The Education Endowment Foundation said the grants would help identify the most effective ways to use digital technology to improve learning for the most disadvantaged pupils. Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said schools spent huge sums on technology but there was too little evidence of its effectiveness. "The gap in educational outcomes between rich and poor is the biggest barrier to social mobility we face and it is essential to find out if and how technology can be used to help close it." </body>

      <title>Biggest educator you've never heard of</title>
      <description>The biggest education provider you've never heard of</description>

      <body>This is the biggest education provider you've never heard of. Until now. The Alison project - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - has already signed up more than two million students to more than 500 online courses. It's adding another 200,000 each month and founder Mike Feerick is confident this expansion could accelerate even more rapidly and reach a billion students towards the end of the decade. But this ambitious project isn't another Silicon Valley spin-off, fuelled by venture capital and a surfeit of sunshine and flow charts. This global digital empire is based in a technology park in Galway in the west of Ireland. If there was such a thing as successful grey skies thinking, on a damp autumn day, this would be a prime location. But Alison's days in the shade could be numbered, as it has won a prestigious international award this week at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar. The online learning platform has already won an innovation award from Unesco. So how has it stayed below the radar? While the new wave of online courses - so-called Moocs, such as Coursera and edX, have become darlings of the digital media, why has Alison not had the same attention? Mr Feerick says the big difference is who they are trying to reach. It's the academic versus vocational divide being played out in the digital market. "The people we're helping do not have a huge voice," says Mr Feerick. While the Moocs are associated with high-status universities, Alison's focus is on the vast numbers of people around the world needing to improve their vocational skills and training. There are courses in subjects such as computer skills, learning English, basic accountancy, building a website, food safety, immunology, introductions to legal studies. He is planning to expand into secondary school level, with video lessons customised for national exam systems, beginning with maths. Organisations from the IMF to the OECD to the European Union have all spoken of the urgency of providing vocational, workplace skills to tackle dangerously high levels of youth unemployment. But Alison has been putting this into practice. A deal struck earlier this year will provide online training for 12 million young people in the Arab world. Many of those accessing the free courses are at the margins of formal education - low-skilled workers, the unemployed and immigrants. Within the coming months, India is expected to become the biggest source of learners, overtaking the UK and US. Nigeria and the Philippines are rapidly growing markets. Mr Feerick wants to use online technology to offer free lessons in the most important basic skills that people need. As he puts it, 99% of the people are learning the same 1% of information, again and again. His other challenge to the established order, heresy to some, is to question the necessity of exam certificates. If people are studying for a specific skill, such as learning to touch-type or a language, he argues the key question is whether they can put the lessons into practice. He says the fixation with a paper trail of certification is part of protecting an educational status quo. "They desperately want to keep the same system." Alison's other big difference is that it is profitable. The courses are free because of advertising revenue. The social mission is underpinned by a strong business sense. Mr Feerick says his approach to social entrepreneurship was influenced by his own business mentor, Chuck Feeney, a celebrated US investor in ideas and education, who took him under his wing when Mr Feerick had been studying at Harvard. Mr Feeney is a famously frugal and publicity-shy billionaire and philanthropist, who is currently helping to fund New York's hi-tech science campus. Inspired by his example, Mr Feerick says he wanted to combine thinking big commercially while maintaining a sense of social purpose. The idea of free education online, available around the globe, became his focus. "Education underpins all social progress. It's the tool of the most ambitious revolutionary in these technological times, you can change the world if you can change education." He sees the internet as making an irresistible impact on education, in the way it has in other industries, with a few giants emerging to dominate the multi-trillion dollar education market. "There is going to be huge consolidation worldwide into a small number of platforms for learning, because it's going to be very hard to compete with them," he predicts, likening it to how Amazon has become the global bookseller. "So these platforms are going to be huge, some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world." There are other projects challenging the idea that online learning should be dominated by prestigious Western universities. The Kepler project, launched in September, is using online technology to bring university lessons to Rwanda, to students who otherwise would have no chance of getting into higher education. Using laptops they can take lectures and resources from top universities putting course material online. In the Rwandan campus there are local teachers who are able to provide face-to-face lessons, with a ratio of 30 students for each member of staff. If they successfully complete their course they can get a US accredited degree. There are 50 students in a pilot phase, being charged $1,000 per year. If it works, this will expand rapidly and the longer-term aim is to reach 7,000 to 10,000 students. "There is a rising demand for higher education in Africa that can't be met by traditional models," says Jamie Hodari, chief executive of the non-profit organisation. The economy in Rwanda is growing, but if it wants to compete with other countries it is severely limited by low levels of education. "They have completely hit a wall," says Mr Hodari. Rwanda has ambitions to become a regional technology hub, but it lacks a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. At present, Mr Hodari says "so many children leave as the top of their class and go on to become taxi drivers, because there is no other pathway". The Kepler idea reflects the way that technology is dismantling the component parts of education - separating the local teaching from the online course materials and the international accreditation. If the format works, Mr Hodari says it could be replicated in other parts of Africa and beyond. It could be a "university in a box" that others could copy, he says. "The playbook will be right there in front of them." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <title>Why we're afraid of 'zombie' faces</title>
      <description>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist.</description>

      <body>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist. A research project by the Open University's Stephanie Lay found a particular fear of "near-human" faces. It explains why blank eyes, automatons, masks and ventriloquists' dolls are common cinema devices to instil fear. The psychologist says a study of 3,000 people found widespread "repulsion" at near-human faces. The finding is part of research into the so-called "uncanny valley" phenomenon in how people react to robots. The effect was discovered in the 1970s in research into whether giving robots human features would make them more reassuring to humans working with them or using them in the home. The research found that people were initially more receptive to robots which were made slightly human looking, but if they began to imitate humans too closely, people were repelled. Instead of being reassured, too close a resemblance to a human form was seen as sinister. Mrs Lay's research is examining this "uncanny valley" effect from a psychological perspective. She describes it as "the sense of unease that accompanies the sight of something almost, but not quite, human". It is the sudden plunge in reaction at a point just before a face is fully humanised. For instance the empty eyes of a zombie figure in an otherwise human face is highly disconcerting. And it explains why the faces of dolls, clowns and dummies are used so regularly to frighten audiences. "A consistent finding of the survey was people's reactions to images where the face was convincingly human but with lifeless eyes or where eerily human eyes appeared in a non-human face," says Mrs Lay. "These were perceived to be the most uncanny and disturbing of all the images and explain why characters such as zombies in horror films unsettle people to such great effect." This is particularly the case with psychological horror films, she says, rather than bloodthirsty shockers. She says this uneasy reaction could be caused by the sudden disruption in how the human brain processes human faces. When people begin to interpret something as a human face, they are left with a sense of disquiet when they come against something that does not match their expectations. Being able to "read" another person's eyes is particularly important in this process of interpreting faces, she says. "It may be that our normal processing mechanisms are not being engaged for these faces, causing the unsettling effect when people want to like a near-human face, but realise something is wrong." </body>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>University staff strike over pay</title>
      <description>Lecturers and support staff at many UK universities are staging a walkout over pay.</description>

      <body>Lecturers and support staff at many UK universities are staging a walkout over pay. Unions say there is "strong support for the action" and 149 institutions are affected. But university employers say support for the strike is "not widespread" and disruption has been "minimal". Rallies are planned for many cities over lunchtime as part of joint action between the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. Union members say their pay has failed to keep up with rising living costs and have rejected a 1% pay offer. But university employers say the "vast majority" of staff think the offer is fair. Officials from the UCU say early reports are that some buildings and departments - including many libraries - have been closed. Teaching at Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University has been cancelled and the chemistry department at Loughborough is shut, they say. The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1%, which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2009. They say universities will face the "most widespread disruption for years". UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: "Staff, from porters to professors have walked out this morning in protest at some of the most sustained pay cuts since the Second World War. "Nobody wants to be on strike, but a 13% real-terms pay cut as vice-chancellors' pay continued to increase and universities' surpluses built up simply is not fair." She said the unions had heard of closed departments and buildings and that some universities had cancelled all teaching for the day. "If the employers try to spin the action as having little impact then it merely shows how out of touch they are with what is really happening on the ground at universities." There was a 35% turnout in the UCU strike ballot, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Universities had warned students some classes might be cancelled and that some some facilities could be closed. Helen Fairfoul, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), told BBC News fewer than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote for strike action. "We can see the strike is not widely supported," she said. "The vast majority of staff think this is a fair offer. This is a difficult period. No pay levels in any sector have kept pace with inflation." She added that salary costs in most institutions would actually rise by about 3% this year because some staff would get incremental increases and merit awards as well as the 1% increase. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We are disappointed that the unions have decided in favour of industrial action. Students have the right to expect that their learning will not be disrupted by such action." </body>

      <title>Call to drop term-time holiday ban</title>
      <description>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking term-time holidays, will be delivered to the government on Wednesday.</description>

      <body>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking holidays during term-time will be delivered later. The 126,000-signature document will be given to the Department for Education. Campaigners say many families cannot afford the higher cost of a break during the school holidays. The DfE said it was giving schools more freedom to set term dates - potentially meaning parents could book cheaper holidays. Until last month, heads could grant up to 10 days' leave a year for family holidays in "special circumstances". Since 1 September, head teachers have no longer been able to grant any absence outside school holidays except under "exceptional circumstances". The reference to the 10-day limit has been removed from the regulations. A petition against the ban, started by a parent and hosted on the 38-Degrees Campaigns By You website, had attracted 126,275 signatures by Tuesday evening. The petition says the ban will "adversely affect" families who cannot afford the higher prices charged to holidaymakers during the school holidays. "Also not all businesses can allow their staff to be off all at the same time", says the petition. "All children who have a good attendance record should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy quality time with their parents on an annual holiday of up to 10 days once per year." Craig Langman, the parent who started the petition, told BBC News his six-year-old son still recalls a holiday the family took to Rome during term-time two years ago and has done school projects based on the trip. "It was probably more educational than being in school to be honest. "He still remembers the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum." Mr Langman says the cost of breaks during the school holidays can be three times as much as during term-time. "I am not asking kids to have a guaranteed extra two weeks on top of their existing 10 weeks' holiday each year - but this blanket ban on term-time holidays with the threat of a fine is almost killing families." He argues that the decision as to whether to grant a request for extra days off school should remain with head teachers. "I feel that most MPs in the government had holidays with their parents when they were younger so why do they think they have the power to stop our children's generation from enjoying the same lifestyle," says Mr Langman. "Soon only rich kids would be able to go on holiday and that's unfair on everyone else." A DfE spokesperson said: "If children aren't in school they lose out on valuable learning time and have to waste more time catching up. That's why children shouldn't be taken out of school during term time unless absolutely necessary. "We are giving all schools the freedom to set their own term dates, for example David Young Community Academy in Leeds operates a seven-term year starting in June. This means that parents and teachers can benefit from cheaper holidays at the end of September. "We want schools to consider changes to term dates that will work for their pupils and their families." </body>

      <title>Extra marks for exam illness up 10%</title>
      <description>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because pupils had problems such as a minor illness.</description>

      <body>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because of pupils having problems such as a temporary illness, the highest level on record. The figures from exam regulator Ofqual showed a 10% increase in such cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There were 374,000 requests approved for "special consideration" in marking this summer's GCSEs and A-levels. The most common adjustment was worth 3% of the maximum exam mark. The figures from Ofqual show that there was an even higher level of requests from schools for such special consideration - rising by 13% on the previous year to 415,200. Only about 10% of these requests were rejected. The extra marks are allowed because an exam candidate has faced an unexpected disadvantage, which could range from a minor illness to something more serious, such as a bereavement. The exam regulator describes the criteria as "temporary injury, illness, indisposition or another unforeseen incident immediately before or during the exam's period". It could also allow a student to receive a grade reflecting their ability if they were unable to attend an exam. The maximum adjustment is 5%, such as a close family bereavement. A "minor illness on the day of the exam" could gain a pupil an extra 2%. As well as these adjustments for unexpected problems, Ofqual says that candidates taking a further 209,900 exam papers were given special access arrangements because of a disability or a medical condition. These numbers of special access cases are falling, both in terms of request and approvals. But the most common request remains asking for an extra 25% time for candidates, which was allowed for 107,400 exam papers. Other types of help included using a reading device or someone to act as a scribe, such as for people with problems with their sight. The exam report from Ofqual also shows a sharp year-on-year rise in penalties on staff for "malpractice" in exams, up 62% to 97, although this was lower than in 2011. The most common type of staff malpractice was giving "inappropriate assistance to candidates" and the most common penalty was a written warning. There were also 135 penalties for exam malpractice for schools and colleges, almost all of which were written warnings. Among pupils, there were 2,590 penalties from this summer's exams - similar to last year. The most common form of cheating was using "unauthorised material", which usually meant a mobile phone. But there have been declining numbers caught trying to use mobiles - down for the fourth consecutive year to 814 cases. </body>

      <body>Youth unemployment in the UK is a "public health time bomb waiting to explode", according to a review by the World Health Organisation. It warned of the health consequences of high numbers of Neets - people not in employment, education or training. More than one million 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK are classed as Neet. The report also said the UK was behind other European countries on female life expectancy, deaths of children under five and child poverty. The WHO and the University College London Institute of Health Equity analysed the reasons for differences in life expectancy across Europe. For the UK, it highlighted the dangers of young people being out of work. Wealth is tightly linked to life expectancy and is one of the major reasons for the north-south health divide in the UK. Being unemployed has immediate health consequences, including an increased risk of depression and suicide. Being out of work in the longer term increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and stroke. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who led the review, said: "Unemployment may be falling in the UK, but persistent high levels of the number of young people over 18 not in employment, education or training is storing up a public health time bomb waiting to explode." The length of the fuse is thought to be 10 to 20 years. The report said women and children in Spain, Italy and Cyprus would fare better than those in the UK. It said life expectancy for women was 83 years in the UK, behind Spain and France at 85 and Germany at 84. The report added that mortality rates in the under-fives were higher than most countries in the west of Europe and even some eastern European nations, including the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Figures also showed that one in four children in the UK live in poverty - a figure higher than other countries such as Iceland, Cyprus and Ireland. Prof Marmot said: "We are failing too many of our children, women and young people on a grand scale. "I would say to any government that cares about the health of its population: look at the impact of their policies on the lives people are able to lead and, more importantly, at the impact on inequality. "Health inequality, arising from social and economic inequalities, is socially unjust, unnecessary and avoidable, and it offends against the human right to health." Prof John Ashton, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: "Michael Marmot is absolutely right that the number of 'Neets' is a public health time bomb. "There is a lot of evidence to show that being out of work is bad your health. "It is disgraceful that a generation of young people are growing up in a world when unemployment is the norm, not the exception." The Department for Work and Pensions said it was "really encouraging" that the numbers of young people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance was falling, but "we're not complacent - we'll continue to do everything possible to give young people the best chance in life". A Government spokesperson said health inequality was taken "very seriously". In a statement they said: "The Chief Medical Officer raised this issue in her recent report on children's health, outlining the need to invest early in our young people to give them good foundations and the best start in life. "We have already successfully protected the poorest from falling behind and last year we saw a reduction of 100,000 children in workless poor families. In addition, we are training an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015, and 16,000 of the most vulnerable families will be helped by family nurses." </body>

      <description>Experts say there should be greater focus on the positive effect internet forums and chatrooms can have.</description>

      <body>Internet forums and chatrooms can have positive effects that should be more widely acknowledged, experts say. The call comes after Oxford University researchers carried out an analysis of 14 different studies looking at how young people use the internet. The review - published in the Plos One journal - said a number of studies had found a link between internet use and self-harm and suicide. But it said others had found the internet could be a positive influence. The dangers of internet use have received widespread coverage this year. In one case, in August, 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire was found hanged after she had been sent abusive messages on a social networking site. Since then research by the NSPCC has suggested a fifth of 11 to 16-year-olds have had negative experiences using the internet. The Oxford University research highlighted a number of dangers from internet use, including the normalising of self-harm and the risk of bullying. It also said there was a "strong link" between internet forums and an increased risk of suicide in particular. But the researchers said some studies had shown that internet forums could support and connect socially isolated people. There were also examples where forum users encouraged positive behaviour, advised others to seek help and congratulated each other for not harming themselves. Report author Prof Keith Hawton said: "Communication via the internet and other electronic means has potential roles in both contributing to and preventing suicidal behaviour in young people. "The next step is going to be development of therapeutic interventions using these channels of communication, especially to access those who do not seek help from clinical services." Joe Ferns of the Samaritans added: "We should acknowledge that many people are using suicide forums and chatrooms to anonymously discuss their feelings of distress and despair, including suicidal thoughts, which may have a positive impact on the individual. They may be expressing feelings that they have never disclosed to anyone in their offline lives. "Rather than concentrating primarily on ways of blocking and censoring such sites, we should think about online opportunities to reach out to people in emotional distress." </body>

      <title>Ed Balls attacks Shoesmith payout</title>
      <description>A six-figure payout to former Haringey children's services head Sharon Shoesmith "leaves a bad taste in the mouth", says shadow chancellor Ed Balls.</description>

      <body>A six-figure payout to the ex-head of Haringey children's services "leaves a bad taste in the mouth," shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said. Sharon Shoesmith, who earned £133,000 a year, won a ruling in 2011 that she was unfairly sacked after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter. BBC Newsnight revealed the payout could cost Haringey Council up to £600,000. In a statement Ms Shoesmith bid a "final farewell" to Haringey, adding she hoped to resume work with children. Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old, died in 2007 after months of abuse. The boy had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Three people were jailed in 2009, including his mother. The Court of Appeal concluded Ms Shoesmith had been "unfairly scapegoated" and her removal from office in December 2008 by the then Children's Secretary Ed Balls had been "intrinsically unfair and unlawful". One government source told BBC Newsnight that the cost to Haringey Council could be as high as £600,000, although Ms Shoesmith is expected to receive a lower sum. The exact figure may not emerge as there are confidentiality clauses preventing its disclosure but it will be significantly short of the £1m figure it had been reported she was seeking. However, it would appear the package is more than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested Ms Shoesmith was entitled to a minimum of three months' salary plus pensions contributions. Three months' salary would have been about £33,000. Mr Balls said his decision in 2008 as children's secretary to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her job had been right. He told the BBC: "An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services. "They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department, and responsible, ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money." Earlier, Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the payout became "inevitable" after the Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Balls "had made a complete botched job of her dismissal". But he added: "This is going to leave a really bad taste in taxpayers' mouths that a not insubstantial amount of public money is being used to pay off somebody who presided over a dysfunctional department in Haringey [where] a 17-month-old boy died in horrific circumstances." Care minister Norman Lamb said what happened in the aftermath of the Baby P's death was "extraordinary" but he was not in a position to judge the authority's decisions. "But it is pretty shocking, the scale of the reported payout, given what tragedy unfolded in that particular borough." In her statement, posted on an online networking site, Ms Shoesmith said: "A final farewell to Haringey as my case concludes. I wish those of you in children's services, especially in Haringey, success, strength and courage in all that you do. "Children have been my life's work and I hope to continue in some capacity soon now that my PhD is almost complete." A statement from Haringey Council confirmed it had reached a settlement with Ms Shoesmith but that the terms of the settlement were confidential and it was unable to comment further. Some of the cash will come from central government, but Haringey council will foot most of the bill, it is understood. An exact figure is yet to be agreed. The Department for Education declined to comment on the story when contacted by the BBC. But one source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was "furious" about the secrecy over the amount paid to Ms Shoesmith, believing it to be "indefensible". Downing Street said the Department for Education's contribution to the payout would be made public. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Ms Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a settlement since the May 2011 ruling. Ms Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Peter Connelly's mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child's death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

Free schools and academies are currently exempt from the government's nutritional guidelines, but research found 92% of parents wanted to see the same standards applied to all schools. The chair of the Lead Association for Catering in Education said people still remember soggy cabbage and lumpy custard, but reckoned "there has been really good hard work" to improve the food, and that: "We are finally cooking on gas". Anne Bull said only 1% of packed lunches meet nutritional standards for school food, and that hot school meals were "by far the best option".

      <title>Is there an 'angst canon' of books that teenagers read?</title>
      <description>Do teenagers still read the same rite of passage books?</description>

      <body>It's 100 years since the birth of Albert Camus. His book The Outsider is one of a select set of works that generations of disaffected teenagers have turned to as a rite of passage. The 1942 novel, also known as The Stranger, is about a French Algerian's seemingly irrational murder of an Arab and his subsequent indifference to his own execution. Central character Meursault is a man alienated from the society in which he lives. There's The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. Central character Holden is alienated from the society in which he lives. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a critique of totalitarian societies, but it's also about Winston Smith and his alienation from the society in which he lives. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World provides a dystopian vision of the world - through the eyes of a man alienated from the society in which he lives. Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar has a female protagonist whose mental illness is partly because of her alienation from a society which has fixed expectations of women. Then there's Joseph Heller's Catch-22 where central character Yossarian is rather alienated. And Franz Kafka's The Trial where… You get the picture. These books have formed a kind of canon of disaffected literature for disaffected teenagers. At the age of 17 and 18, readers are often searching for something with a bit of existential angst. And nothing taps into teenage angst quite like the idea of exceptionalism. The books in "the canon" can provide a feeling of uniqueness - a clandestine understanding of the world that nobody else quite gets. "'I can see through this, and Kafka can, but you can't'," says Guardian literary critic Nicholas Lezard of the feeling. "'Me and Kafka, we're buddies.'" A book like Catch-22 provides a prism for teenage readers, says Prof John Sutherland, an English literature professor at University College London. "It had sort of this ironic view of the adult world, where you're always trapped. [These books are] intellectual breakthrough stuff, a way of breaking out, a rite of passage." As well as looking for echoes of their disaffection, teenagers are also often attempting to look, well, a bit cool. The books are like a badge of honour. An actual badge, in Lezard's case. "I found a badge for sale that just had the word 'Outsider' on it," he says. "I wore that on my school blazer for a bit." The book itself might be placed conspicuously on show, with the titles poking out of school blazer pockets and tops of satchels. "[They're] what you might call 'accessory books'," says Sutherland. "The book was, as it were, to make a statement. It was particularly pronounced in 1960s, 70s and 80s adolescence. People used to sit around in coffee shops holding a copy of whatever the latest Samuel Beckett was and probably couldn't answer how many Ts there are in Beckett." Any teenager seen reading the book on public transport is sending out a message. "You know that if you sit on the Tube reading that [type of book], people will know you're an angst-ridden teenager," says historian Lisa Jardine, who has researched the reading preferences of men and women. Some may even detect a note of pretentiousness although most teenagers stop short of sporting a beret and pipe and disdainfully peering over a French-language copy of L'Etranger [The Outsider]. But calling the majority of teenagers pretentious is too harsh, says Jardine. "I don't like that word. I would call it 'statement reading'," she says. "They're exploring them, and they're struggling with them, and therefore it's more about statement than showing off. You swap [the fact] that you've read these books and then you know you've got a kindred spirit." Even if there is some posturing, it's not unhealthy, says Lezard, as it's partly about raising your game into adulthood - and some of the ideas do filter in. "So I don't regret any of this," he says. "Perhaps the badge." But the canon of teenage angst books is not the same for both sexes. "There's an absolutely dramatic difference between what girls and boys read at puberty," says Jardine. "Boys read angst books, so they read Catcher in the Rye, L'Etranger and books like that. Girls read expanding emotion and sensibility books. Jane Eyre, [Dodie Smith's] I Capture the Castle, the Brontes… books about difficult relationships. "It was absolutely staggering how little teenage angst books came up on the women's list." Men also tend to cling on to their teenage favourites later into life more than women, Jardine's research showed. But does the canon stay the same? And is there always a group of angsty teenagers to read it? "Nineteen Eighty-Four makes you re-evaluate society," says 17-year-old Enosh Ghimire, from Ealing, west London. "It's a common theme in many of the books - criticising society or evaluating what society is." The canon itself isn't stable. New books may be added, others fall by the wayside. A good movie adaptation can be an obstacle. Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - those reaching adolescence after these films came out had to be extra committed to read the books after watching them - or disciplined enough to read them first. Ghimire says he and many of his friends enjoy reading Game of Thrones and that many are reading the Hunger Games, both of which have popular TV or movie franchises to accompany them. Laura Hampson, 18, from Liverpool, says her friends don't read that much but "they've read The Perks of Being a Wallfower recently because of the film". Hampson is a fan of contemporary John Green titles Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. But she says her favourite book is David Nicholls's popular book One Day, pointing to its unusual time structure and relatable characters. "It didn't make out either character was without fault," she adds. "With some romance books the other character can sometimes be described as this perfect person, which most people can't relate to." Another obstacle to the cultish or cool feel of books in the canon is the way many of them have been absorbed into English literature syllabuses on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 30 years. Ghimire studies both Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four as part of his course, admitting that they're not books he'd normally read. "School opens [them] up," he says. "I wouldn't have known about Brave New World if it wasn't for school. School made me aware that there are other books outside of what I would normally read." But news and current affairs makes some of the books resonate further, he says, citing the Edward Snowden spying affair as making Nineteen Eighty-Four really click. "And Brave New World is going to be relevant for a long time because of technological advances," Ghimire says. And it's only with a sense of irony, or perhaps disappointment, that teenagers realise their mum's favourite book was also Nineteen Eighty-Four and their dad's was Catch-22. "The feeling of being awkward and unhappy at school is in fact perennial," says Sutherland. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <body>Uwe and Hanalore Romeike want to educate their seven children at home, rather than in the school system. But in Germany where they come from originally, home schooling is illegal. It isn't just discouraged, it is punishable by heavy fines and imprisonment and their children could be taken away from them. So along with other German home-schooling families they have come to the United States and are seeking asylum. But the claim they are being persecuted has not been accepted and unless the Supreme Court intervenes they face deportation from the US. "We are being persecuted, as are many other home schooling families in Germany," says Mr Romeike. "Parents should have the right to choose the best education for their children. That's what's lacking in Germany. We don't have freedom of education." The family arrived in the US in 2008 and settled in Tennessee. In 2010 a state court granted their request for asylum but two years later the Obama administration called for a review and a higher court overturned the decision. The Romeikes' only hope of staying in the US now rests with the Supreme Court which still hasn't decided whether to hear their appeal. "We started home schooling because our two oldest children were in public school for a few years and from the beginning had problems. "Our daughter started having headaches and stomach aches, our son's personality changed. After we started home schooling all these symptoms disappeared. We didn't want to stop," says Mr Romeike. "Home schooling is not about motivation or methodology. Home schooling is simply about parents making the choice as to what's best for their children," says Michael Donnelly, a lawyer for the Home School Legal Defense Association. The HDLA is assisting the Romeikes and other German parents including Dirk and Petra Wunderlich. German police recently placed their four children in temporary care because the Wunderlichs refused to send them to school. "There was no other question about this family - they weren't abusing or neglecting their children - the only issue was that they were not in school," says Mr Donnelly. "It's really quite striking when you look at a free country - as Germany claims to be - and you see how they treat parents who want to exercise a freedom." The children have been returned to the Wunderlichs, but the German government has banned them from leaving the country, says Mr Donnelly. Like many families who decide to educate their children at home, the Romeikes and the Wunderlichs are evangelical Christians. But some law experts say they their grounds for claiming religious persecution in Germany are weak. "Germany is a democratic country and it chooses to make attendance in schools mandatory. It offers many choices of school - Christian, Jewish, Muslim, private, public - every imaginable sort," says Professor David Abraham an expert on immigration and citizenship law at the University of Miami School of Law. "But its legislature has decided that children need the social context of meeting other children. "Parents have a responsibility to raise their children properly, but that does not mean they have a right to counter democratic legislation. What they can't call persecution is the obligation to attend school with other children. That's an important social value that the German legislature has adopted," he says. Many children educated at home in the US also attend home school co-ops where parents pool their skills to enable specialised or more advanced subjects to be taught. They also meet other families who share similar values. "It's a very nice environment. Everything is very Christian and I really enjoy that. I also enjoy being able to pray with my mom whenever I need to," says 13-year-old Esther Reinhold who lives in Sterling, Virginia. Her parents, Ulrike and Matthias Reinhold, emigrated from Germany and became US citizens in order to home school their six children. "We enjoy home schooling because it is very family oriented, it strengthens our family," says Mr Reinhold. "We spend time teaching them the regular subjects but they also have time to pursue their interests in a stronger way than they would in a normal school setting." "I'm definitely glad we are allowed to home school here," says 15-year-old Ruth Reinhold who also attends a co-op and has private piano lessons. "I could go to a public Christian school but even there, there's still a lot more drama about the dating thing and there's a lot more foul language. I know that if I went to public school within about four weeks I would be going along with the others, cursing and dishonouring God especially." More than two million children are taught at home in the US and the number is growing. Professor Brian Ray, president of the National Home Education Research Institute, says that a strand in the home schooling movement developed in the 1970s when some Christians began questioning the type of education their children were receiving in state and privately run schools. But he says it's too simplistic to describe home schooling as a religious movement. "I've met many non-Christian parents who would say the same thing: it's not the government's job to indoctrinate my children," he says. "The core issue is who is in charge of a child's education. Whether home schoolers are agnostic, Jews, or Christians they all believe in parental responsibility for the child's education and they don't think the state should be doing it." </body>

      <title>Housing association helps tenants to read</title>
      <description>The housing association that also teaches literacy</description>

      <body>A few months ago, Christopher had to ask a neighbour or a friend to read him details of a personal hospital appointment or a letter about his rent. Now he can do it himself. In and out of care homes all his life, Christopher left school at 13, without being able to read and write properly. But his life changed when he saw an advert in the local community centre about the Eastlands Homes Literacy Beacons Project in Manchester. After six weeks of one-to-one tuition with a mentor, he was beginning to make sense of the words around him. "I can pick up my mail and look at it, I can pick up books. Before I'd get a brown letter and I'd have to ask a friend or a partner to help," he says. "It's like being proper independent. I don't have to knock on someone else's door. It's given me more independence and I'm proud of it like, I really am." The Literacy Beacon Project was set up 18 months ago by the not-for-profit housing association Eastlands Homes for its tenants and others in the area. Eastlands has 8,000 properties across east and south-east Manchester and many of these are in some of the most deprived wards in the country. So far more than 40 people have completed the course. The idea is simple - adults who struggle to read and write are matched with a volunteer "champion" or mentor who, after some training, meets with them regularly on a one-to-one basis over a six-week period. The scheme started when front-line staff realised many tenants were struggling to read correspondence from them, using excuses like they had not received the letter or had lost their glasses. Neighbourhood services manager Danny O'Sullivan says: "We knew a lot of our tenants had literacy problems. "From a business point of view, it does us a good turn because they can read our letters and so on, but the drive behind the scheme was to help people in the community. "We want to improve people's lives, we are a community project as well as a housing association." Danny says a lot of people who believe they cannot read or write actually do have some basic literacy skills, but have such low confidence they have convinced themselves they are illiterate. He says: "If something frustrates us, we tend not to do it. Take technology - you'd rather ask the kids. You can do it, but the frustration stops you. "The issue is the negative stereotype in your head, 'I can't read, I don't need to read, I'm not going to read.'" Amanda approached the Literacy Beacons Project because she was struggling to fill out contact sheets in her role as a volunteer mentor for offenders recently released from prison. "I was always behind with the sheets, but I couldn't get anyone else to do it because it's confidential information. Now I've got the confidence to pick up a pen. "I think it's because of the one-to-one support, they made me feel dead confident. I had no confidence to pick up a pen. "But here it's the best thing because it's a one-to-one. If I'm in a classroom I get all nervous and worried I'm going to be called thick, because that's what I've had in my life. It's all about my confidence, my champion gives me loads of encouragement. "It's amazing, I've got someone saying I'm good and that makes me feel better about myself. It's made me feel really confident in my reading and writing. "I can go for a job now, I've got the confidence to go for that job and go to the interview." But it's not just the tenants who have benefited from the scheme. Eastlands has found that those who volunteer as champions have reaped huge rewards. Paul, a champion who has helped four people develop their reading, says: "I retired a few years ago and I get so much reward out of this - I never got the buzz that I get out of this. It's time-consuming but it's lovely to do. "As much as they're learning, we're learning from them because we're understanding their issues. All my working life I've never enjoyed anything like this." Sam, who has mentored five tenants, adds: "It's so rewarding to see what you've achieved for somebody. "It's better as well because we're not teachers and we don't spell everything right. They feel at ease with one person and they don't have to feel that someone's ahead of them." Sam was particularly touched by the case of one elderly lady who had been constrained by literacy problems all her life. "I had a 75-year-old lady and only her husband knew she had trouble with reading and writing," she says. "When he passed away, she was on her own. She was buying the same things in the supermarket because that was what she recognised. But now she can read the labels - she has the choice." Champions are not just community volunteers - staff working for the housing association are also encouraged to mentor those who sign up for the project. Eastlands communications manager Abi Mistry says: "I had a woman with three kids and she'd never been able to leave her children little notes. When she finally wrote a letter to her eight-year-old son, she cried - and I cried, it was so emotional. "She had left school with no qualifications, had her first child at 17 and couldn't help them with their homework. To see her confidence grow was amazing." The housing association is now so confident with the scheme, it hopes to take it to other areas of need, such as prisons and rehabilitation centres. Danny O'Sullivan says: "We're in talks with the National Literacy Trust. We're trying to grow it, to get it elsewhere. It's a great system and we hope it'll go out further. "I'd like to see a lot of other organisations doing it and not just housing associations. It would be brilliant in prisons, in probation offices, drug rehabilitation centres, community charities, anywhere that socially deprived people are accessing. "We understand it well enough now to take it to other places." Amanda wants to see the project benefit other people like her. She says: "I just think it should be rolled out everywhere because there are people out there, especially older people, who would be too scared to say, 'I can't read or write.'" In the meantime, the literacy project has been shortlisted in the Business in the Community category at the Manchester Be Proud Awards. </body>

      <title>Can US universities learn from India?</title>
      <description>Should the US learn from India's technology students</description>

      <body>By the year 2020 the US is expected to have 1.4 million computing-related jobs, but will only have the capacity to fill a third of them. Should schools in the United States be looking to Asia for tips on how to get more students to study science and maths? From a young age, children at India's top schools have it drilled into them that they must excel in maths and science. Their goal is to win a coveted place at one of the 16 Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and a fast track to a high-flying job. The IITs enjoy no international ranking but they have been recognised by the US Congress and Microsoft founder Bill Gates for their contribution to US innovation. Graduates have gone on to be leading high-tech innovators - for example the creator of Google news Krishna Bharat, and the co-founders of online poker site PartyGaming studied at the IITs. Each year about one million Indian students sit the entrance exam hoping for this kind of success, but just 10,000 people, or 1% of them make it. There are nine times more people applying for each place than there are applying to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, one of the highest-ranking universities in the world. One student who made the grade is 21 year old Utkarsh Malhotra. He is now in his final year but says passing the entrance exam was like scaling an academic Mount Everest. "I know people who changed their diets, who changed their sleeping patterns, who changed everything for this examination," he says. "IITs are like a pressure cooker situation so I don't know if this prepares us for future life well or not." Eighteen year-old Twinkle Aurora is hoping to follow in Malhotra's footsteps. She attends a private coaching institute and spends 13 hours a day, six days a week studying to pass the exam. "It's very tough because you can't stay in touch with social media like Facebook and WhatsApp - they take a lot of your time, so you have to sacrifice lots of friendships… but after one year when you've slogged your way through the year you get something that's big," she says. But once the students are in, the pressure remains. I met Malhotra on a Friday afternoon but instead of winding down for the weekend, he was working hard. "I don't know [if any other] institutes in India have exams on a weekend but this one does. The pressure is immense and you grow to live with it," he says. So what makes the IITs so successful? "We get the best students in the country," says Suneet Tuli, the dean of research and development at the Delhi campus. "And for a country of 1.2 billion, the best is really the best." "The second thing - this is part of our culture, [education is] based a lot on mathematics, so that gives them good analytical skills." Some think the US could learn from the way India approaches science and maths, including Susan Wojcicki, senior vice president of advertising and commerce at Google. She thinks there should be much more emphasis on computer science in US schools. "Nine out of 10 schools right now are not teaching computer science. If you think about the future and you think about how important computer science is going to be it's a problem - we're going to need a lot more kids to be able to have those skills," she says. "I would really like it to be like reading and math and science and spelling - they are requirements - everybody takes it, everybody learns it, and that's the way I think we need to think about computer science and coding in the future." There has been some criticism of the methods the Indian education system uses with its reliance on rote learning, and whether this really prepares the IIT students for the wider world. Steve Stepanian, head of Indian operations for the management consultancy Bain and Company, has some reservations. "At the more junior levels they are very quantitatively sound, they are very responsible, no problem. The issue becomes [when] they're given an open-ended question - that is where there seems to be more of a struggle," he says. For example, they would get the basic figures spot on, but when he asks what advice they would give to a chief executive - "that is where you draw a real blank," he says. In his experience, the number crunching by US students may not be as accurate, but "when I come to that question of what the CEO should do, they are much more capable of synthesising that and pulling together a much more cohesive answer and make a recommendation". But for Wojcicki it is about the balance between learning the basics and thinking creatively: "I look at Silicon Valley and we have so many great engineers that have come from India," she says. "American schools are really good [when it comes to] thinking about the creative component but we also need kids to learn the basics."

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063</url>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <body>The Hubble telescope has spotted an asteroid radiating six comet-like tails, making it resemble a "rotating lawn sprinkler". Other asteroids appear as tiny points of light to astronomers, who are puzzled by the outbursts of dust. Asteroid P/2013 P5 has been ejecting dust periodically for at least five months and may be in the process of breaking up. They have outlined details in the journal Astrophysical Journal Letters. "We were literally dumbfounded when we saw it," said Prof Dave Jewitt, from the University of California at Los Angeles. "Even more amazing, its tail structures change dramatically in just 13 days as it belches out dust. That also caught us by surprise. It's hard to believe we're looking at an asteroid." Astronomers say it is possible the asteroid's rotation rate increased to the point where its surface started flying apart. Radiation pressure from the Sun could have sent the space rock spinning, to a point where the asteroid's weak gravity could no longer hold it together. Astronomers will continue observing P/2013 P5 to see whether the dust leaves the asteroid in the equatorial plane. Because of the physics involved in the spin rate theory, say the astronomers, this would provide strong evidence for a rotational breakup. They do not believe the tails are the result of an impact with another asteroid because they have not seen a large quantity of dust blasted into space all at once. Astronomers discovered the object in August, using the Pan-STARRS telescope in Hawaii. At the time, P/2013 P5 looked unusually fuzzy. The multiple tails were discovered when Hubble was used to take a more detailed image on 10 September. </body>

      <body>A project aimed at protecting internationally important seabird populations on two of the Isles of Scilly by killing more than 3,000 brown rats, is under way. The islands, which are located off Cornwall, are home to breeding populations of 14 seabird species and approximately 20,000 birds. Eradication experts from New Zealand and the UK have been contracted to carry out the work. "Among many challenges our seabirds face, the greatest threat on land is predation of eggs and chicks by brown rats," said Jaclyn Pearson from the Isles of Scilly Seabird Recovery Project. "The brown rats were accidently introduced to islands from shipwrecks in the 18th Century," she added. The project is part of a 25-year programme to protect "internationally important" seabird numbers, including those of Manx shearwaters and storm petrels, and is costing more than £755,000. The rodents will be poisoned on St Agnes and Gugh by Wildlife Management International Limited (WMIL). The company has helped eradicate rats from Ramsey Island off Wales, Lundy Island off Devon and the Isle of Canna in the Scottish Hebrides. Elizabeth Bell, from WMIL said: "A period of intensive baiting will start from the 8 November and most of the rats will be dead by the end of November. We'll then target the surviving rats." A long-term monitoring programme will start at the beginning of 2014 to check the rodents have been eradicated from the islands. Ms Bell said all the bait stations were enclosed, tied down and were designed not to kill any other species, such as rabbits. Ms Pearson said: "The project is 25 years in length, although the project team will disband after five years, for the remaining 20 years the community will continue to protect their seabird heritage, by keeping the islands 'rat-free'. "This includes correct waste management, ensuring bio-security on boats and freight to the islands, and of course, educating all visitors to the islands to be vigilant and 'rat on a rat'". "This is the largest community-based island restoration project attempted in the world to date, with 85 residents living here year round." She added that similar populated islands around the world hoped to learn from the project and carry out similar work to "safeguard their seabirds". A feasibility study estimated the population of brown rats on the Isles of Scilly was about 34,500, with 3,100 occurring on St Agnes and Gugh. Johnny Birks, chair of the Mammal Society, said: "Brown rats are not native to Britain... it's our own fault they are so widespread and that makes it right for us to repair the damage we've caused." He added that the eradication could benefit the Scilly shrew and other species found on the islands, but it was key that the rats did not reinvade. Ms Pearson added she was "certain" rats on neighbouring islands would not swim to St Agnes and Gugh. "The shortest distance over water from St Agnes and Gugh to an island which has rats, is between Gugh and the Garrison on St Mary's. "This distance of about one mile (1.6km) is just under the maximum distance a rat can swim in favourable conditions, but the deep channel, strong current and cold sea temperature all year round will make it highly unlikely that a rat can swim back." Tony Whitehead, from the RSPB, said: "Eight out of ten islands around the world now have rats, including remote places such as Tristan da Cunha in the South Atlantic and Henderson Island in the South Pacific. "The predators are known to have impacted on the populations of 75 species of seabird, from albatross to shearwaters to small petrels. "In response, there is a worldwide effort to rid islands of these voracious creatures," he added. In January, Richard Bellamy, head of the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) South West, said we have a "collective responsibility for the native wildlife on the Isles of Scilly". HLF has awarded the project £269,100, alongside £460,255 from the EU Life fund , with further contributions from Isles of Scilly Area of Outstanding Beauty Sustainable Development Fund and Natural England. </body>

      <title>India Mars probe makes first burn</title>

      <body>After a successful launch on Tuesday, India's Mars spacecraft has carried out the first of six crucial engine firings in Earth orbit. The probe performed the firing with its liquid fuel thruster at 19:47 GMT on Wednesday (Thursday 1:17 IST). The aim is to gradually build up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. If the firings succeed, the spacecraft will travel for 300 days, ready for entering Mars orbit in 2014. K. Radhakrishnan, head of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told the Times of India that the spacecraft was in "excellent health". After lift-off, the Mars Orbiter Mission (MOM) was placed into an elliptical parking orbit around Earth with a perigee (the point in the orbit closest to Earth) of 248.4 km and an apogee (the point farthest away) of 23,550 km. The six major thruster firings are designed to manoeuvre the MOM into a so-called hyperbolic trajectory so that the probe escapes the Earth's sphere of influence. After a 10-month journey, the probe will arrive at Mars on 24 September next year. The engine will be fired again to slow down the spacecraft, enabling it to be captured by the planet's gravity and place it into Martian orbit. Four further manoeuvres between 8 and 16 November will raise the craft's apogee to 192,000km. "It's going to be a large sequence of events," said Mr Radhakrishnan. On 1 December, the engine will be fired again for its "trans-Martian injection", sending the craft on its way to the Red Planet. This week, Prof Andrew Coates, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, told BBC News that the planned mechanics for getting to Mars were on a sound footing, and that the probe stood a good chance as long as its engines fired correctly. But any delay in these operations would require precious extra fuel to be used to catch up with the desired path to Mars. India's PSLV rocket - the second choice for the mission after a beefier launcher failed - was not powerful enough to send the MOM on a direct flight to Mars. So engineers opted for a method of travel called a Hohmann Transfer Orbit to propel the spacecraft from Earth to Mars with the least amount of fuel possible. At a cost of about $72m (£45m), the MOM is extremely cheap by the standards of planetary missions. Even so, some commentators have questioned whether India should be spending its millions on a planetary mission when a significant part of its population are in poverty and figures for childhood malnutrition are some of the highest in the world.

      <title>Japan to remove Fukushima fuel rods</title>
      <description>Nuclear engineers in Japan prepare to move more than 1,000 fuel rods from the crippled Fukushima power plant in a crucial, but risky operation.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24843657</url>

      <body>A task of extraordinary delicacy and danger is about to begin at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power station. Engineers are preparing to extract the first of thousands of nuclear fuel rods from one of the wrecked reactor buildings. This is seen as an essential but risky step on the long road towards stabilising the site. The fuel rods are currently in a precarious state in a storage pool in Unit 4. This building was badly damaged by an explosion in March 2011 following the Great Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Moving the rods to safety is a high priority but has only become possible after months of repair work and planning. One senior official told me: "It's going to be very difficult but it has to happen." The fuel rods are four-metre long tubes containing pellets of uranium fuel and the fear is that some may have been damaged during the disaster. When the tsunami struck the Japanese coast, the flood swamped the diesel generators providing back up power to the reactors. Three of the reactors went into a state of partial meltdown. By coincidence, Unit 4 was undergoing maintenance, so all of its fuel rods were being stored. But the meltdown of a neighbouring reactor led to a build-up of hydrogen which is believed to have led to the explosion in Unit 4. In the days after the tsunami, there were fears that the blast had damaged Unit 4's storage pool and, in desperation, the authorities used helicopters and fire hoses to keep it filled with water. A guiding principle of nuclear safety is that the fuel is kept underwater at all times - contact with the air risks overheating and triggering a release that could spread contamination. So the operation to remove the rods will be painstaking. A senior official in the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) told me that the rod assemblies will be lifted out in batches of 22 and in casks filled with water. This will be done with a new crane, recently installed in the wrecked building, after the original one was destroyed. The task of removing each batch will take 7-10 days, I understand. Two critically important issues are whether the rods themselves are damaged and therefore likely to leak and whether the casks remain watertight to ensure the rods have no contact with the air. The METI official acknowledged the risks including a possible "release of radiation" from the fuel or if the casks holding the fuel are dropped. He said that "countermeasures" have been prepared - including back-up wires to hold the loads and mechanisms to hold the fuel in the event of a power failure. A briefing document released by the site's owners, Tepco, spells out a series of safety systems designed to minimize the dangers. For example, the fuel pond itself has been strengthened while the new crane can handle loads of one tonne while the fuel cask only weighs 450kg. Collision tests, it is said, have shown that even if the fuel cask is dropped, it may be deformed but its seals will not be broken. The fuel rods will then be deposited into a new "common" pool with a cooling system. According to the METI official, "the common pool is planned to be used over a long period, supposedly for 10 to 20 years, and will be reinforced against possible future earthquakes and tsunamis". The Tepco document says the rods will be checked for signs of damage - large amounts of debris fell into the pool during the disaster so the risks are real. It says that checks for corrosion have found only minor signs so far - with "no corrosion affecting fuel integrity". But only when the operation begins will engineers get a detailed look at the rods and a chance to assess their state. One senior figure in Japan's nuclear watchdog told me: "Inspections by camera show that the rods look OK but we're not sure if they're damaged - you never know." He said Unit 4 presented particular dangers because its entire stock of fuel rods was in the pool at the time of the accident. If the operation goes as planned, attention will then focus on the massive challenges posed by Units 1, 2 and 3. According to the METI official, the latest investigations have shown that despite the meltdowns experienced by each reactor, their temperatures have now stabilised. In Units 1 and 2, readings show the presence of water in what's called the primary containment vessel - suggesting that the melted fuel rods have not penetrated that safety barrier. The radiation level is too high in Unit 3 for that kind of examination to be carried out but using data from the reactor pressure vessel the official assumes that water is also present in the primary containment. Meanwhile, the site continues to be plagued by leaks of radioactive water flowing into the Pacific Ocean. Tepco will not confirm the precise timing of the fuel rod operation but after so much public outrage at the company's handling of the crisis so far, scrutiny of this latest episode will be intense. </body>

      <title>US moves to ban trans fats in foods</title>
      <description>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to Americans' health.</description>

      <body>US food safety officials have taken steps to ban the use of trans fats, saying they are a threat to health. Trans fats, also known as partially hydrogenated oils, are no longer "generally recognised as safe", said the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The regulator said a ban could prevent 7,000 deaths and 20,000 heart attacks in the US each year. The FDA is opening a 60-day consultation period on the plan, which would gradually phase out trans fats. "While consumption of potentially harmful artificial trans fat has declined over the last two decades in the United States, current intake remains a significant public health concern," FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg said in a statement. "The FDA's action today is an important step toward protecting more Americans from the potential dangers of trans fat." If the agency's plan is successful, the heart-clogging oils would be considered food additives and could not be used in food unless officially approved. The ruling does not affect foods with naturally occurring trans fats, which are present in small amounts in certain meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats are used both in processed food and in restaurants as a way to improve the shelf life or flavour of foods. The fats are created when hydrogen is added to vegetable oil, making it a solid. Nutritionists have long criticised their use, saying they contribute to heart disease more than saturated fat. Some companies have already phased out trans fats, prompted by new nutritional labels introduced in 2006 requiring it to be listed on food packaging. New York City and some other local governments have also banned it. But trans fats persist primarily in processed foods - including some microwave popcorns and frozen pizzas - and in restaurants that use the oils for frying. According to the FDA, trans fat intake among Americans declined from 4.6g per day in 2003 to around 1g per day in 2012. The American Heart Association said the FDA's proposal was a step forward in the battle against heart disease. "We commend the FDA for responding to the numerous concerns and evidence submitted over the years about the dangers of this industrially produced ingredient," said its chief executive, Nancy Brown. Outgoing New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the charge to ban trans fats in that city, said the FDA plan "deserves great credit". "The groundbreaking public health policies we have adopted here in New York City have become a model for the nation for one reason: they've worked," he said. </body>

      <title>Fossil fuel subsidies 'are reckless'</title>
      <description>A new study suggests the world is spending seven times more money subsidising fossil fuels than fighting climate change in developing countries.</description>

      <body>The world is spending half a trillion dollars on fossil fuel subsidies every year, according to a new report. The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) says rich countries are spending seven times more supporting coal, oil and gas than they are on helping poorer nations fight climate change. Some countries including Egypt, Morocco and Pakistan, have subsidies bigger than the national fiscal deficit. The new report calls on the G20 to phase out the payments by 2020. While there is no globally agreed definition of what a fossil fuel subsidy actually is, the report draws on a range of sources from the International Monetary Fund to the International Energy Agency. It details the range of financial help given to oil, coal and gas producers and consumers from national governments and through international development. What emerges is a complicated web of different types of payments in different countries. In the United States, for example, the government in 2011 gave a $1bn fuel tax exemption to farmers, $1bn for the strategic petroleum reserve and $0.5bn for oil, coal and gas research and development. Germany gave financial assistance totalling 1.9bn euro to the hard coal sector in the same year. And the UK gave tax concessions worth £280m in 2011 for oil and gas production. The report accuses rich governments of "shooting themselves in both feet" by undermining attempts to put a price on carbon and by giving no incentive to companies to switch from high carbon fuels. "This is a reckless use of public money at a time when people are very concerned about energy costs," Kevin Watkins, executive director of the ODI, told BBC News. "Why are we spending $112 per adult in the OECD countries subsidising an energy system that is driving us towards dangerous climate change when there are alternatives?" In developing countries, the report says the subsidies often take the form of keeping fuel prices low to help alleviate poverty. Governments in Indonesia, Pakistan and Venezuela are spending twice as much on fossil fuel subsidies as they are on public health. "Almost all these subsidies go to those who are connected to the grid because the governments give money to the energy providers, who pass it on to consumers. "The top 20% of these societies get around half of the total subsidy package," said Kevin Watkins. International finance for development is hugely focussed on oil, coal and gas. According to the ODI, 75% of energy project support from international banks went to fossil fuel projects in 12 of the highest emitting developing nations. The research adds to data from the International Energy Agency that says global subsidies for fossil fuels are six times higher than those for renewable energy. The OECD has stated that coal is subject to the lowest levels of taxation. The ODI hopes that enough countries in the G20 group will follow up on promises made to look at the issue. The institute believes that subsidies for energy are similar to subsidies for agriculture that plagued international trade negotiations in the 1990s. Ultimately, agreement was found on removing them. The ODI believes there can be a similar outcome for fuel supports. "This has to be the mother of all win-win scenarios," said Kevin Watkins. "You'd have a win for taxpayers, a win for governments north and south and you'd have a win for the planet as well." Follow Matt on Twitter @mattmcgrathbbc. </body>

      <body>Scientists are looking for 100,000 volunteers prepared to have their DNA sequenced and published online for anyone to look at. The UK Personal Genome Project could provide a massive free tool for scientists to further understanding of disease and human genetics. Participants will get an analysis of their DNA, but so will the rest of the world, and anonymity is not guaranteed. They are warned there could be unknown consequences for them and relatives. Unlocking the secrets of DNA could transform the understanding of disease. A deeper understanding of Alzheimer's disease is emerging by looking for differences in the DNA of people with and without the disease. Prof George Church, who runs the US version of the project, said analysing 100,000 genomes could lead to advances in common diseases such as diabetes. He said: "We're finding more and more of these common diseases are a collection of rare diseases. "Cancer used to be a disease, then it broke up into lots of different diseases by tissue, then lots of sub-categories based on the genes that are impacted, so now it's thousands of diseases." Participants will have to pass tests to prove they fully understand the risks of making their genetic identities freely available for the world to use before taking part. There will be immediate risks and those that emerge as genetic technology advances including: Dr Peter Mills, who is investigating the ethical issues around biological and health data with the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, told the BBC: "The difference with genetic data is you're not just committing yourself to something you might not fully envisage, but you're also implicating biological relatives. "There is potentially huge public benefit, but there is the potential for it to rebound, but how that rebounds on the person, families and those yet to be born is very difficult to know." Cian Murphy, a 24-year-old PhD student at University College London, wants to take part. He said: "Very few people live their whole lives not affected by some genetic illness, your sample could be the difference between a cure being discovered or not." As part of the study, participants will find out intimate details about their genome, such as the presence of any high-risk breast-cancer genes. They will be given a list of doctors they can go to if they need further medical advice. While people will not have their name published, studies have shown it is possible to work out someone's identity from genetic databases and other public records. Dr David King, from the group Human Genetics Alert, said: "Human Genetics Alert would strongly advise people not to give their genetic information to a project which will share it with the world. "Once your data is online, you will never be able to recall it. The project's informed-consent procedures are not valid, because they do not tell you all of the risks. That is not informed consent." He warned the data could be used for any purpose including those people objected to ethically and said there was "no reason" for it to be public. Meanwhile, the government's Genomics England project is trying to sequence 100,000 NHS patient's DNA, which is private and carries a threat of legal action if patients are identified. Sir John Chisholm, executive chairman of Genomics England, said: "We would want anyone consenting to their DNA being used for sequencing to have a clear understanding of what they are contributing to, and to do so on a voluntary basis which we understand will be the case with Personal Genome Project. "Anyone who takes part in any initiative that involves giving a DNA sample for sequencing should be as clear at the time of giving their consent as they can be of how that sample will be used, and who will have access to it, and what future purposes it can be put to." </body>

      <body>A Soyuz rocket carrying the torch for the Sochi Winter Olympics has docked with the International Space Station, as part of efforts to showcase next year's games in Russia. On Saturday, two Russian cosmonauts will take it on a historic first spacewalk. The torch will not be lit. The event is part of a rebranding exercise by Russia, designed to portray it as a strong, modern country, says the BBC's Daniel Sandford in Baikonur. The rocket left Earth at 04:14:25 GMT. It blasted off from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, crewed by three cosmonauts - Russia's Mikhail Tyurin, American Rick Mastracchio and Koichi Wakata from Japan. The Olympic symbol will be handed over to fellow cosmonauts Oleg Kotov and Sergei Ryazansky, who are already on the orbiting station, when they go on the spacewalk on Saturday. "Our goal here is to make it look spectacular," Mr Kotov said earlier. "We'd like to showcase our Olympic torch in space. We will try to do it in a beautiful manner. Millions of people will see it live on TV and they will see the station and see how we work." The Olympic torch has been carried into space twice before - in 1996 and 2000 - but it has never left a spaceship. It will not be lit aboard the space station as this would consume oxygen and pose a risk to the crew. The Sochi torch will then be returned to Earth and used to light the Olympic cauldron in February next year. It is all part of the elaborate preparations for Russia's first Olympics since the Soviet era. It is also the most expensive one so far, costing around $50bn (£31bn; 1,620bn roubles). The run-up to the games has been marred by controversy over a new Russian law that restricts the spread of information about homosexuality, as well as allegations by rights groups that authorities have rounded up migrant workers who helped build the Games venues in Sochi. In yet another minor setback, the flame has gone out several times since the torch relay began last month. </body>

      <title>Volcanic lava that flows for a year</title>
      <description>Researchers capture the first footage of the glacial flow of rocky obsidian lava, still flowing months after an eruption.</description>

      <body>An explosive volcanic eruption in Chile has given scientists the first direct insight into the strange motion of rocky lava known as obsidian flow. Rather than a red river of molten rock oozing down a mountainside, this lava is a thick, rubble-strewn mass of rock. Dr Hugh Tuffen, from the University of Lancaster, and his colleagues took the first measurements of this lava flow. They found that it kept moving more than a year after the eruption. Their results were published in the journal Nature Communications. To carry out their study, the team visited a volcano in the south of Chile called Cordon Caulle in January 2012. "There had just been an enormous eruption [in June 2011] that was still continuing," Dr Tuffen told BBC News. This explosive eruption produced rhyolite - the rock that creates the "incredibly sticky magma" that results in these strange obsidian flows. "This was our chance to get right in there and see an obsidian flow moving for the first time," he said. No-one had previously witnessed an obsidian flow moving. As well as witnessing the ongoing volcanic eruption, the researchers recorded the lava - a heaving mass of black rock more than 30m (100ft) thick - as it "slowly creaked its way down the mountain". Team member Prof Jonathan Castro from the University of Mainz in Germany captured footage and images of the flow. Piecing these images together produced a 3-D model of the obsidian flow's changing shape. "What was exciting was that it kept on going," said Dr Tuffen. "Even after the eruption had stopped - it was still flowing away many months afterwards." Initially, the lava advanced several metres per day, then as its thick rocky crust cooled, it slowed. But, according to Dr Tuffen's data, over a year after the eruption, the lava was still advancing at a rate of 1.5m to 3m per day. Crucially, the lava flow altered as pieces of the rocky mass collapsed and the hotter lava leaked out in what the scientists referred to as "breakouts". This, Dr Tuffen said, revealed "lots of secrets about how lavas advance". "So now we can make new models that can encompass all the different sorts of lavas on the planet and how they move." Dr William Burton, of the US Geological Survey, said: "What these guys have done is observe processes along the margins that may govern how these things flow - the breakouts. "Knowing what they learned in this paper may help predict where this flow is going to go next. "So if it is going close to a town you might be able to use some of the lessons they learned to [work out changes in its movement]." Dr Burton added that the most likely place for the next rhyolitic volcanic eruption was near Mono lake, in northern California - a popular ski area. Prof Peter Sammonds, an earth scientist from University College London, said the imaging techniques the team had developed would be "powerful" for the future study of volcanoes. "The modelling of these lava flows is quite important," he said. "These patterns can seen as a general feature [of volcanoes] - it doesn't simply relate to this one. Volcanoes that have produced rhyolitic eruptions are found all over the world, and have been some of the biggest on Earth. These include the US "supervolcano" eruptions at Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, and Novarupta in Alaska, which erupted in 1912 and was the biggest of the 20th Century. </body>

      <description>Government advisers say the UK is not out of step with major nations in reducing emissions.</description>

      <body>Britain is playing its part in a worldwide bid to reduce emissions and should not weaken its proposed cuts, says a report to the UK government. The Committee on Climate Change says no change in global science or policy justifies a slackening of effort. The report was compiled after Chancellor George Osborne said the UK's competitiveness might be put at risk by leading the world in curbing emissions. The CCC research challenges this assumption. "It is not accurate to say that the UK is leading the world on this," the CCC’s chief executive David Kennedy told BBC News. "We aren’t acting alone. We have made ambitious commitments, but other countries have too – they are acting on them and developing low-carbon technologies. "Some of our European counterparts are discussing targets stricter than ours for 2030 so if we want to be part of the low-carbon revolution we will have to make sure we aren’t left behind." Mr Kennedy said China was now clearly global leader in clean technology: "China is leading the low-carbon revolution. It has committed to invest in 700 Gigawatts of renewable power generation by 2020 – that’s 10 times the whole UK power system. "They are investing in five million electric vehicles – in multiples of what we are doing here. “Even the US is cutting its emissions and is committed to doing so in coming years.” The shale gas revolution in the US has forced down emissions because gas is much less polluting than coal; the report says it is likely that the US will meet its commitment to reduce 2020 emissions by 17% on 2005 levels. It points out that China has committed to reduce carbon-intensity by 40-45% from 2005 to 2020, and introduced policies to deliver in its 12th five-year plan. With ongoing action, China’s emissions could peak in the early 2020s, the report says. It says Germany has also made medium-term commitments in line with the UK. But Mr Kennedy admitted that the world’s efforts were still nowhere near enough to keep the world on track for a high likelihood of a stable climate. The World Meteorological Organization has announced that greenhouse gases has reached another record. UNEP’s Emissions Gap report also warned that delaying emissions cuts would make the task even more expensive. The CCC was founded to advise government on how to meet the Climate Change Act, which commits the UK to reducing CO2 80% by 2050, in a step-by-step process. For several years the Chancellor has expressed fears about the impact of climate policies on the affordability of energy in the UK. At the Conservative Party conference he told The Times that Britain should not be "in front of the world" on tackling climate change. But the Climate Change Act was designed specifically to make it hard for future politicians to weaken long-term priorities when faced with political difficulty. In order to reduce the UK’s targets, there needs to have been a weakening of the science base or of international action. But the CCC’s report says: “We conclude in this report that, in respect of science, international and EU criteria, there has been no significant change in the circumstances upon which the budget was set. In this regard, there is therefore no legal or economic basis to support a change in the fourth carbon budget. A Treasury spokesman said: "We want to tackle climate change, but it should be done in a way that doesn't put huge costs on people's energy bills or destroys manufacturing jobs. The shale gas revolution in America shows you can reduce carbon emissions, bring bills down and create jobs." The committee thinks the UK is most unlikely to experience a US-style shale gas boom. The committee is concerned at the political backlash against green energy, which it believes has been fuelled by newspaper campaigns. It says renewable energy subsidies are likely to bring down energy bills in the medium term if gas prices continue to rise as many analysts forecast. Doug Parr from Greenpeace said: "The CCC reminds us that tackling climate change is as urgent as ever, but the Treasury persists with its scientifically illiterate campaign to unravel domestic climate policy. The Lib Dems must not allow a watered down fourth carbon budget." Rhian Kelly, the CBI's director for business environment, said: "It seems sensible to maintain the fourth carbon budget at this point in time. However, as the CCC suggests, it would be prudent for the Government to look again at the UK's emissions reduction pathway once EU discussions have concluded, to make sure we remain aligned." Jonathan Grant from consultant PwC said: "The Committee is right to highlight the danger of changing tack or rolling back regulations, as it could undermine business and investor confidence that long term government policy will deliver what is needed to tackle climate change. "In the short term, UK energy emissions increased 2.6% last year, much higher than GDP growth, because of an increased use of coal in power generation. The cost of wholesale transformation of energy generation and other green measures highlights the challenge that politicians are facing everywhere on climate change." Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <description>A new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the earth 80 million years ago is discovered in southern Utah.</description>

      <body>A new super-predator dinosaur that roamed the Earth 80 million years ago has been discovered in southern Utah. It was closely related to its slightly larger relative, Tyrannosaurus rex, but lived earlier, making it the largest living land predator of its time. Growing to about 30ft (9m) long, the predator has been named Lythronax argestes which means "king of gore". The research, published in the journal Plos One, highlights once more that the age of discovery is far from over. The team also hopes this new find will help uncover what the climate was like towards the end of the age of dinosaurs. "It's always exciting to find new species but what's really significant is what these species tell us about their ancient world," said Randall Irmis, co-author of the study at the Natural History Museum of Utah, US. "This was a very different place 80 million years ago. It was a very lush, wet, tropical environment and there were no polar ice caps at the time." First discovered in 2009, the partial skeleton included a number of bones from the skull and some from the rest of the body. The fossils were then excavated and studied in the lab. The new discovery was closely related to T. rex and shows that similar features evolved 10 million years earlier than previously thought. Lythronax had a short and narrow snout and forward slanting eyes. Like its evolutionary relative, it had a head full of sharp teeth and was a ferocious predator, the largest of its ecosystem. The team also uncovered the most complete fossils of another named species of Tyrannosaur - Teratophoneus curriei. It was previously only known from a few skull bones but the team now have more than 70% of its skeleton. "There's a whole diversity of different branches of the Tyrannosaur family tree that are waiting to be found out there," Dr Irmis told BBC News. It was previously unclear why there were so many different Tyrannosaurid species present in a similar area, as the animals were able to move around freely. The palaeontologists believe this was due to a changing of sea level. "We think that when the sea level was high it was isolating areas in western North America that caused different species to evolve in isolation and that's why we're finding so many different species," added Dr Irmis. He explained that the creature had been named the "King of Gore" because of its super-predator status. The second part of its name "argestes" comes from Greek poet Homer's naming of a south-westerly wind. "Tyrannosaurids were the really large predators in their ecosystem. It's fairly certain based on what we can see on their skull, teeth and body size they probably ate whatever they could fit in their mouths," added Dr Irmis. Another research member of the team, Joseph Sertich of the Denver Museum of Nature and Science, US, explained that the back of its skull was very wide which gave it good hunting eyes. "One of the things that makes T. rex different from other dinosaurs is that it is able to look forward, it has binocular vision. Lythronax had that feature as well, its field of view could overlap which probably made it a better hunter," Dr Sertich told BBC News. "It was the apex predator of it's time. It was the oldest advanced Tyrannosaur of its group, which is quite surprising. "This is the tip of the iceberg. It's amazing what we're finding in southern Utah right now. You can walk over some of the hills and find fossils littering the sides of the slopes," he added. Mike Benton at the University of Bristol, UK, who was not involved with the study, said the new find was important for understanding patterns of evolution of the Tyrannosaurids. "Previously, Tyrannosauri origins were uncertain, whether in Asia or North America, and the new find tends to suggest a mainly North American evolution for the group." </body>

      <title>Asteroid hit rate 'underestimated'</title>
      <description>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia this year has been underestimated, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>The threat of another asteroid strike like the one that hit Russia earlier this year is much higher than was previously thought, a study suggests. Researchers have found that space rocks of a similar size to the one that exploded over Chelyabinsk are hurtling into the Earth's atmosphere with surprising frequency. Scientists say early warning systems need to be put in place. The study is published in the journal Nature. Lead author Professor Peter Brown, from the University of Western Ontario, Canada, told the BBC World Service's Science in Action programme: "Having some sort of system that scans the sky almost continuously and looks for these objects just before they hit the Earth, that probably is something worth doing. "In the case of Chelyabinsk, a few days' to a week's warning would have been valuable." Fireball The asteroid that exploded over Russia on 15 February this year was estimated to be about 19m-wide. It hit the atmosphere with energy estimated to be equivalent to 500,000 tonnes of TNT, sending a shockwave twice around the globe. It caused widespread damage and injured more than 1,000 people. Now though, scientists say there could be many more space rocks like this one on a collision course with the Earth. An international team looked at the last 20 years of data collected from sensors used by the US government and infrasound sensors positioned around the globe. These detectors are in place to detect the threat of nuclear weapons, but they can also capture the blasts caused by asteroid impacts. The researchers found that during this time about 60 asteroids up to 20m in size had smashed into the Earth's atmosphere: far more than was previously thought Most went undetected because they exploded over the ocean or in very remote areas. Prof Brown explained: "We were able to capture the occurrence rate you would expect of things like Chelyabinsk and smaller impacts. When you compare that to the numbers you get from telescopic [observations], our numbers are several times higher." This suggests that the risk from asteroids of this scale has been underestimated. The team estimates that the strike rate of asteroids that are tens of metres in size is between two and 10 times higher than was previously thought. "Something like Chelyabinsk, you would only expect every 150 years on the basis of the telescopic information. But when you look at our data and extrapolate from that, we see that these things seem to be happening every 30 years or so," said Prof Brown. An event such as the Tunguska impact in 1908, where an asteroid flattened thousands of square kilometres of forest in Siberia, would probably happen every few hundred years rather than every few thousand years, he added. Prof Brown said more effort should be made to create early warning systems. "There are literally millions of objects in the tens-of-metres-of-size range that we suspect are near Earth asteroids, that can get close to the Earth," he said. "We have only discovered over 1,000 of these. There are many more of these to find, but it would be very expensive to find all of these and it probably wouldn't make a lot of sense because the atmosphere largely stops them. "But what might make sense are systems that find something a few days or weeks before they hit... to tell you where on the Earth and when they will hit. That would allow some warning to be given to the civil defence authorities." In another study, also published in Nature, scientists believe they have traced the asteroid that the Chelyabinsk meteor splintered off from. They think it is a fragment of a 2km-wide rock called asteroid 86039. Professor Jiri Borovicka, from the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, said the orbits were "conspicuously similar", although the team could not prove "the common origin with absolute certainty".

      <title>Warming gases reach record high</title>
      <description>New data from the World Meteorological Organization says that atmospheric levels of CO2 and methane have broken new records.</description>

      <body>The levels of gases in the atmosphere that drive global warming increased to a record high in 2012. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), atmospheric CO2 grew more rapidly last year than its average rise over the past decade. Concentrations of methane and nitrous oxide also broke previous records Thanks to carbon dioxide and these other gases, the WMO says the warming effect on our climate has increased by almost a third since 1990. The WMO's annual greenhouse gas bulletin measures concentrations in the atmosphere, not emissions on the ground. Carbon dioxide is the most important of the gases that they track, but only about half of the CO2 that's emitted by human activities remains in the atmosphere, with the rest being absorbed by the plants, trees, the land and the oceans. Since 1750, global average levels of CO2 in the atmosphere have increased to 141% of the pre-industrial concentration of 278 parts per million (ppm). According to the WMO there were 393.1ppm of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere in 2012, an increase of 2.2ppm over 2011. This was above the yearly average of 2.02ppm over the past decade. "The observations highlight yet again how heat-trapping gases from human activities have upset the natural balance of our atmosphere and are a major contribution to climate change," said WMO Secretary-General Michel Jarraud. "It is a worry. The more we delay action the bigger the risk we cannot stay under the 2 degree Celsius limit that countries have agreed," he said. While the daily measurement of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere exceeded the symbolic 400ppm mark in May this year, according to the WMO the global annual average CO2 concentration will cross this point in 2015 or 2016. Levels of methane also reached record highs in 2012 of 1,819 parts per billion. Concentrations have been increasing since 2007 after a period when they appeared to be levelling off. The WMO report says that it is not yet possible to attribute the methane increase to either human activities like cattle breeding and landfills or natural sources such as wetlands. They believe that the rising emissions come from the tropical and mid-latitude northern hemisphere and not from the Arctic, where methane from the melting of permafrost and hydrates has long been a concern. Emissions of nitrous oxide have also grown, with the atmospheric concentration in 2012 at 325.1 parts per billion, 120% above pre-industrial levels. Nitrous oxide gas, although its concentrations are tiny compared to CO2, is 298 times more warming and also plays a role in the destruction of the ozone layer. Recent research indicates that the rate of increase in emissions might be slowing down, but the gases can continue to concentrate in the atmosphere and exert a climate influence for hundreds if not thousands of years. Scientists believe that the new data indicates that global warming will be back with a vengeance, after a slowdown in the rate of temperature increases over the past 14 years. "The laws of physics and chemistry are not negotiable," said Michel Jarraud. "Greenhouse gases are what they are, the laws of physics show they can only contribute to warming the system, but parts of this heat may go in different places like the oceans for some periods of time," he said. This view was echoed by Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. "For the past decade or so the oceans have been sucking up this extra heat, meaning that surface temperatures have only increased slowly. "Don't expect this state of affairs to continue though, the extra heat will eventually come out and bite us, so expect strong warming over the coming decades." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Green spaces 'can save NHS billions'</title>
      <description>Woodland Trust chief says increasing people's access to green spaces can cut billions of pounds from the NHS healthcare bill.</description>

      <body>The Woodland Trust's chief executive has said increasing people's access to green spaces could cut billions of pounds from the NHS healthcare bill. Sue Holden said it had been calculated that the NHS could save £2.1bn a year if everyone had access to green spaces. She made the comments at an event to mark the culmination of the five-year Visit Woods project. Ms Holden added that only an estimated 14% of the UK's population had "easy access to trees". She told an audience of invited guests at the Houses of Parliament that the link between "healthy woods and healthy lives" was a "connection that really has to be made much more and much more often". She added: "It is a connection that we know intrinsically, we believe it to be true but - increasingly - it is something that evidence is backing up as well. "It has been calculated, for example, that £2.1bn of healthcare costs could be saved if everyone had access to green spaces." But she added that just 14% of people in England had access to woodlands within 500m of their home. One of the invited speakers, planning minister Nick Boles, said he was keen for people not to just think in a "defensive way about woodlands". He explained: "Although it is important to think about how we preserve what we have inherited, but we must also think about how we create something new, how do we make sure that our burgeoning population in new cities and suburbs are able to enjoy little slices of woodland like so many of us have done. "Just because something is not 400 years old does not mean it does not have value because in 200 years' time, they will thank us just as we thank those who went before us and planted those woods." The Visit Woods project, funded by Natural England, is an online database of 11,500 woodlands around the UK open to the public. The website, hosted by the Woodland Trust, also listed details of woods owned by the likes of the Forestry Commission, National Trust, RSPB, Wildlife Trusts, councils, organisations and individual landowners. During the event, hosted by Conservative MP Charles Walker, case studies were presented that, organisers said, highlighted the link between green spaces and peoples' wellbeing. These included obesity, mental health, dementia and autism. The role that green spaces and woodlands can play in improving people's wellbeing has been the focus of a growing body of research. A study published earlier this year suggested that urban green spaces did improve people's wellbeing and quality of life. Researchers from the University of Exeter, using data from 5,000 households over 17 years, found that people reported lower levels of mental distress and higher degrees of life satisfaction when they were living in greener areas. Researchers agree that the body of evidence is sufficient for urban planners to factor in the benefits derived from green spaces when designing new developments. Other research has included identifying a link between the lack of regular contact with the rural and natural environment and an increase in the number of cases of allergies and asthma. In Japan, the health benefits of spending time in forests has its own word, shinrinyoku, which means "forest bathing". The disconnection of an increasingly urbanised society with the natural world has been described as "nature-deficit disorder". The phrase, coined by Richard Louv, US author of Last Child in the Wood, primarily focuses on how the current generation of children's contact and understanding of nature has "changed radically" from their parents' and grandparents' experiences. A 2009 report by Natural England found that only 10% of children played in woodlands, compared with 40% of their parents' generation. A joint event this week organised by the Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce and the Field Studies Council hosted a discussion entitled Reaching into the Outside. It aimed to address concerns that future conservation efforts were at risk as the world became increasingly disconnected with the natural environment outside their doors. The Woodland Trust's head of government affairs, James Cooper, said there was a "need to act on the progress made by VisitWoods and… improve people's access to woodlands, such as encouraging health professionals to make better use of woodlands as a resource". He told BBC News: "What the project has shown is that by providing knowledge, you can unlock the potential of woodlands for people that live nearby. "From a policy point of view, one of the key things is that it shows the ability of trees and woodlands to deliver on a range of government agendas beyond the obvious. "We would want to see better joined up working between health, environment and planning agendas." </body>

      <title>'New part of knee joint discovered'</title>
      <description>A newly discovered ligament identified in the knee may hold the key to common injuries, Belgian surgeons believe.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24826323</url>

      <body>Two knee surgeons in Belgium say they have identified a previously unfamiliar ligament in the human knee. Writing in the Journal of Anatomy, they suggest the fibrous band could play a part in one of the most common sports injuries worldwide. Despite glimpses of the ligament in medical history, this is the first time its structure and purpose have been so clearly established, they say. But experts say more studies are needed to prove its relevance to knee surgery. Four main ligaments - or thick fibrous bands - surround the knee joint, criss-crossing between the upper and lower leg bones to provide stability and prevent excessive movement of our limbs. But the anatomy of the knee remains complex, and several international groups have been exploring the less-defined structures of the joint for some time. The notion of this particular ligament was first made by French surgeon Paul Segond in 1879 but it has evaded definitive surgical classification for many years. Now building on the work of other surgeons, Dr Claes and Professor Johan Bellemans of the University Hospitals of Leuven, Belgium, say they have closely mapped the band which runs from the outer side of the thigh bone to the shin bone. And they say this anterolateral ligament could play an important protective role as we twist or change direction. Mr Joel Melton, a consultant knee surgeon at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, UK, who was not involved in the research said: "If you look back through history there has been a veiled understanding that something is going on on that side of the knee but this work finally gives us a better understanding. "I think this is very exciting - there is no doubt they have hit upon a very important anatomical structure." The Belgian surgeons used macroscopic dissection techniques to examine 41 donated knee joints and pinpointed this ligament in all but one specimen. And they say the presence of this band could help them better understand and treat a common sports injury that has puzzled doctors for some time - the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear. An injury to the ACL is typical in people who pivot during sport - from athletes and basketball players and footballers and skiers. A tear can happen when you change direction rapidly or stop suddenly and causes pain, swelling and reduced movement in the knee. But despite improvements in surgical techniques, between 10-20% of people with a repaired ACL tear are unable to recover fully. In particular, some patients say their knees give way as they twist or turn. Dr Claes and Bellemans think an injury to the anterolateral ligament (ALL) may be partly responsible for this. They hypothesise some people may injure the ALL at same time as the ACL, leaving the knee less stable as the leg rotates. And their biomechanical studies suggest tears in this ligament may also be to blame for small fractures that have previously been attributed to ACL injuries. Mr Paul Trikha, a knee surgeon at the Surrey Orthopaedic Clinic, who was also not involved in the research said: "I do around 150 ACL repairs each year. When I saw Dr Claes' research, it blew me away. "Knowing about the ALL has given us a better understanding of what other structures may be damaged during this common injury and this will hopefully open up opportunities to improve surgery for our patients." But reaction to this work has been mixed. Gordon Bannister, professor of orthopaedics at Bristol University said: "There is no doubt this is a very interesting paper from the anatomical point of view but at the moment this is not a major clinical breakthrough. "Its role in knee injuries is a perfectly reasonable hypothesis to test but the most important step is to see whether any intervention to the ligament actually makes a significant difference to patients." Dr Claes and Bellemans have already started exploring this possibility and are offering repairs of the new ligament in certain cases. Their next steps are to refine their techniques and monitor their patients to see if there are lasting improvements to their mobility. Dr Claes said: "We surgeons may need to rethink what we know about common ACL injuries. Though we have shed light on the purpose of this ligament and its role in common injuries, we now need to find out for certain when it is best to intervene surgically. "Long-term studies will give us that answer and hopefully allow us to perfect a minimally invasive techniques to give our patients a better recovery." </body>

      <title>Physics probes 'splashback' problem</title>
      <description>Scientists have studied the fluid dynamics of urine "splashback", with hygiene implications for men and women.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24820279</url>

      <body>US physicists have studied the fluid dynamics of urine "splashback" - and found tips to help men and women with their accuracy and hygiene. Using high-speed cameras, the team filmed jets of liquid striking toilet walls and studied the resulting spray. Splashback was low when the jets were used close up with a narrow "angle of attack", said the Brigham Young University team. They will present their research at an American Physical Society meeting. "In response to harsh and repeated criticisms from our mothers and several failed relationships with women, we present the splash dynamics of a simulated human male urine stream," reads their conference abstract. But there is a more serious side to the research. The work is led by Prof Tadd Truscott and Randy Hurd of the "Splash Lab" at Brigham Young in Provo, Utah, who jokingly refer to themselves as "wizz kids". "People ask me, are you serious? I tell them yes, this may involve 12-year-old humour, but it's also a real problem," Prof Truscott told BBC News. "We've all been in disgusting toilets with puddles on the floor - these places are a breeding ground for bacteria." For example, the detergents used to clean hospital toilets could actually increase the spray of disease-causing bacteria, by reducing the surface tension of water, according to a recent study. One might think the physics of aiming urination had already been summarised by the formula: "get it all in the bowl". But micturation is still a messier business than it needs to be, according to the research. Taking measurements live "in the field" did not appeal to the scientists, so the duo built a urination simulator. The "Water Angle Navigation Guide" is a five-gallon bucket with hoses connected to two types of synthetic urethra. The team fired coloured water at various target "toilets" at the velocity and pressure of average human urination. Then, using a high-speed camera, they captured the moment of impact in remarkable visual detail. Splashback was heightened by a phenomenon known as Plateau-Rayleigh instability, where a falling stream of liquid breaks up into droplets. "The male urine stream breaks up about 6-7 inches outside the urethra exit," Mr Hurd explained. "So by the time it hits the urinal, it's already in droplet form. And these droplets are the perpetrators of the splash formation on your khaki pants." His advice? "The closer you are, the better. If you can get stream impact with the porcelain, it's a lot less chaotic." Of course, in a domestic bathroom, distance from the toilet is governed chiefly by one variable: "to stand or sit". "People are always arguing over which is better. Because when you sit close, you're also closer to getting wet," said Prof Truscott. "In Germany there is a derogatory term 'sitzpinkler' for a man who sits down to pee. It means he's kind of a wuss. "So we wanted to look at whether sitting down is really effective. What are the splash differences?" To compare the two positions, the scientists gave rulers to their friends and sent them into the toilet. "It turns out you are five times as far away when you stand up - and that's a pretty significant difference in impact velocity for those droplets of urine," said Mr Hurd. Impact with the toilet water is captured in a video by the team. "You can see the droplets create a large cavity in the water, which then collapses, causing even greater splashback. The amount of splash is considerable," Mr Hurd explained. "It seems that sitting down is the best sure-fire way to avoid unwanted splashing in a traditional toilet." Above all, he says, "the biggest thing you can do" to reduce splashback - sitting or standing - is to alter the "angle of attack". Aiming directly at a vertical urinal wall - a 90 degree angle - causes a nasty kickback, as does aiming directly at the toilet water. "Narrowing the angle really helps," said Mr Hurd. For a typical urinal, "best practice" means standing slightly to one side, and aiming downwards at a low angle of impact. "This way you take advantage of both splash-reduction techniques," Hurd explains. Prof Truscott encourages men and women to "be artistic" with their aim and find an angle to suit the particular facility they are faced with. The designs of public toilets and home bathrooms does not always help us achieve 100% efficiency, he said. "Most surfaces you pee into, such as porcelain, are hydrophilic, which is a disadvantage. The water spreads across them, creating a puddle to splash into," said Mr Hurd. He believes that hydrophobic coatings will ultimately make toilets more hygienic, with important benefits for hospitals, schools, and workplaces. The Brigham-Young team has been "inundated" with commercial products to reduce spray - such as fabric inserts, urinals with triangular fins, and toilet bowls with unusually sloping angles. "Some work fantastically - others really don't work at all. It's almost worse than nothing," says Truscott. "My favourite is painting a fly on the wall to indicate where you should aim. Unfortunately, some companies put that fly in the wrong place." Sega has even developed a "Toylet" urinal game, installed in Tokyo Metro stations to award men points for accuracy. But Prof Truscott says one of the most effective tricks is also the simplest - drop a few pieces of tissue into a toilet bowl to soften the blow. The Splash Lab team plans to investigate further toilet designs and find "the optimal approach for urinal usage", removing some of the obstacles between men, women and bathroom harmony. </body>

      <body>The late Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat may have been poisoned with radioactive polonium, says a Swiss forensic report obtained by al-Jazeera. Arafat's official medical records say he died in 2004 from a stroke resulting from a blood disorder. But his body was exhumed last year amid continuing claims he was murdered. The Swiss report said tests on the body showed "unexpected high activity" of polonium, which "moderately" supported the poisoning theory. Many Palestinians have long believed that Israel poisoned Arafat. There have also been allegations that he had Aids or cancer. Israel has consistently denied any involvement. A spokesman for the Israeli foreign ministry said the Swiss investigation was "more soap opera than science". The scientists - from the Vaudois University Hospital Centre (CHUV) in Lausanne, Switzerland - carried out a detailed examination of Arafat's medical records, samples taken from his remains and items he had taken into the hospital in Paris where he died in 2004. The biological materials included pieces of Mr Arafat's bones and soil samples from around his corpse. The scientists concluded that their results "moderately support the proposition that the death was the consequence of poisoning with polonium-210". The scientists stressed that they had been unable to reach a more definitive conclusion because of the time that had lapsed since Arafat's death, the limited samples available and the confused "chain of custody" of some of the specimens. Polonium-210 is a highly radioactive substance. It is found naturally in low doses in food and in the body, but can be fatal if ingested in high doses. The scientists have made "a pretty strong statement", according to Prof Paddy Regan, an expert in radiation detection and measurement at the University of Surrey in the UK, who was not involved in the investigation. "They are saying the hypothesis that Arafat was poisoned with polonium-210 is valid and has not been disproven by the data. However they cannot say definitively that he was murdered." Prof Regan says a series of assumptions would have been made in order to ascertain how much Po-210 may or may not have been in Mr Arafat's body at the time of his death. Po-210 has a short half-life of about 138 days. Prof Regan said measuring the tiny fraction left and extrapolating it back to the time of Arafat's death was like a blind man holding the tail of an elephant and using the information to work out the size of the animal. The second problem, he said, was that Po-210 occurs naturally in the environment. However, an indicator that the polonium may be synthetic is if there was far less Pb-210 (lead-210) in the samples. The professor highlighted results from two samples - the shroud under the corpse of Mr Arafat and urine samples taken from his underwear - both showed high levels of Po-210 compared to Pb-210, possibly suggesting the presence of "additional" synthetic polonium. He noted however that most of the samples of polonium measured in the report were accompanied by activities from Pb-210. Parallel investigations are being carried out by French and Russian experts - one Russian official said last month that no traces of polonium had been found. Yigal Palmor of Israel's foreign ministry told the BBC: "This is more soap opera than science." He said the investigations had been commissioned by "interested parties" - Mr Arafat's widow and the Palestinian Authority - and had "never bothered" to look for some key data. "The other huge hole in the theory is the absence of all access to the French hospital where Arafat died and to Arafat's medical files," said Mr Palmor. "How can the cause of death be determined without the opinion of the doctors or the results of the medical tests they ran on the patient? "Israel doesn't feel concerned in the least." Speaking in Paris, Arafat's widow, Suha, said the Swiss results revealed "a real crime, a political assassination". "This has confirmed all our doubts. It is scientifically proved that he didn't die a natural death and we have scientific proof that this man was killed." Reuters said she did not name any suspects and acknowledged that her husband had had many enemies in his lifetime. Arafat, who led the Palestine Liberation Organisation for 35 years and became the first president of the Palestinian Authority in 1996, fell violently ill in October 2004 at his compound. Two weeks later he was flown to a French military hospital in Paris, where he died on 11 November 2004, aged 75. France began a murder inquiry in August 2012 after the Lausanne scientists, working with an al-Jazeera documentary crew, found traces of polonium-210 on Arafat's personal effects. His widow had objected to a post-mortem at the time of his death, but asked the Palestinian Authority to permit the exhumation "to reveal the truth". His remains were removed from his tomb in the West Bank city of Ramallah in November 2012 and reinterred the same day. Last month, the head of the Russian Federal Medico-Biological Agency, Vladimir Uiba, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying that Arafat "could not have been poisoned with polonium", saying that test carried out by Russian experts "found no traces of this substance". However, the agency later denied that Mr Uiba had made any official statement on the findings. The head of the Palestinian investigation team, Tawfiq Tirawi, confirmed on Tuesday that the Russian and Swiss reports had been delivered. The Palestinian team is reported to have handed over its findings on Saturday. </body>

      <title>Forbidden City rocks carried on ice</title>
      <description>The huge stones that make up China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says.</description>

      <body>Huge stones that make up parts of China's Forbidden City were transported along artificial ice paths lubricated with water, a team says. That's despite the fact that wheeled vehicles had been developed 3,000 years earlier. The colossal city was built in the 15th Century by workers at the start of the Ming dynasty. Writing in PNAS journal, the team says that wood-on-ice sliding was more reliable than using wheels. Using sledges on ice was much more expensive and needed more workers but it was deemed a safer method than mule-powered transport. Howard Stone, professor of mechanical and aerospace engineering at Princeton University, said that on his first tour of the Forbidden City, he and colleagues were curious about how some of the huge stones had been transported. "There's a story on a sign that comments about an ice pack, so we started to investigate it," he told BBC News. "The funny thing about that sign is if you go to the leading scholarship on the science and technology of China, they don't indicate this as far as we can tell. "Most scholarly work indicates that the Chinese had the wheel in 1500 BC and the conclusion from that was they didn't have any need for sledges dragged by man. The Forbidden City was built 3,000 years later, so you have a contradiction. "So our suggestion is somehow that they didn't recognise the use of the artificial ice paths to drag these large rock carvings." But when the team translated a 500-year-old document from the historical record, they found a mention of huge stone carvings transported on ice. They then made calculations looking at the friction of ice to see how plausible it would be to drag such large rocks over the short time period in winter, when it was cold enough to do so. Prof Stone said several hundred workers would have been needed to transport stones ranging from 100-300 tonnes. "If you look at the frictional characteristics of ice for the rocks of this size, we estimate that 300 people were needed for this kind of dragging," he explained. Advance planning was also vital, as water had to be laid out in the winter months so it could freeze along the 43-mile (70km) stretch from a quarry outside Beijing. "They would dig wells every kilometre, pour water on the road which would give it a very smooth surface, The ice can support a lot of weight, they were then able to drag these objects," said Prof Stone. Other researchers say they were already aware of the use of ice to transport marble stone, but it had never been published in academic literature. Sally Church, from the Faculty of Asian and Middle Eastern Studies at Cambridge University, had noticed the use of this method of moving marble after translating a Chinese book in 2007 called Stories of the Forbidden City. It was written in 1962, but based on earlier sources. The text said: "Really huge stones were moved on a contraption called a 'dry ship' or 'land ship'. Large pieces of wood were put together into a raft-like object, and there were two of these. "In very cold weather they poured water onto the roads and let it freeze, then either they or animals would pull it along." Dr Church said that it was "certainly new" and interesting to look at this topic from an engineering perspective. "It is just a small fact that lies buried in the sources in the subject. I would compare it to something like our knowing that the Tower of London once kept elephants and other exotic animals in a sort of zoo," she told BBC News. </body>

      <title>One in five suns has habitable world</title>
      <description>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet.</description>

      <body>Astronomers have estimated how many of the 100 billion stars in our galaxy hosts a potentially habitable planet. Using data from Nasa's Kepler space telescope, they argue that one in five stars like the Sun hosts an Earth-sized world located in the "habitable zone". This zone is the region around a star where temperatures allow for water - a key ingredient for life - to stay liquid at the surface. The researchers have published details in the journal PNAS. "What this means is, when you look up at the thousands of stars in the night sky, the nearest Sun-like star with an Earth-size planet in its habitable zone is probably only 12 light years away and can be seen with the naked eye," said co-author Erik Petigura, from the University of California, Berkeley. He added: "That is amazing." His UC Berkeley colleague Andrew Howard said the discovery showed that planets like our own were relatively common throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Last week, astronomers announced the discovery of an Earth-sized, rocky planet orbiting its star at a hundredth of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. Temperatures on this world would reach between 2,000C and 2,800C, with much of the dayside molten, meaning there would be little chance for life here. But team members cautioned that even finding Earth-sized planets in the habitable - or "Goldilocks" - zones of their stars was no guarantee these worlds would be hospitable to life. "Some may have thick atmospheres, making it so hot at the surface that DNA-like molecules would not survive," said another author, Geoff Marcy, professor of astronomy at Berkeley. But Prof Marcy added: "Others may have rocky surfaces that could harbour liquid water suitable for living organisms. "We don't know what range of planet types and their environments are suitable for life." Researchers had previously combed through some 42,000 stars and discovered 600 likely planets. Of these, 10 were both Earth-sized and located at a distance that was just right for liquid water to persist on the surface. However, the team then corrected for planets that might have been missed by software designed to sift through the Kepler data for planet signatures. This process involved introducing fake planets into the data. Accounting for these missed worlds, as well as the fact that only a small fraction of planets are oriented so that they cross in front of their host star as seen from Earth, the astronomers were able to estimate that 22% of all Sun-like stars in the Milky Way have Earth-sized planets in the habitable zone. "For Nasa, this number - that every fifth star has a planet somewhat like Earth - is really important, because successor missions to Kepler will try to take an actual picture of a planet, and the size of the telescope they have to build depends on how close the nearest Earth-size planets are," Andrew Howard said. "An abundance of planets orbiting nearby stars simplifies such follow-up missions." </body>

      <title>India launches spacecraft to Mars</title>
      <description>India has successfully launched a spacecraft to the Red Planet - with the aim of becoming the fourth space agency to reach Mars.</description>

      <body>India has successfully launched a spacecraft to the Red Planet - with the aim of becoming the fourth space agency to reach Mars. The Mars Orbiter Mission took off at 09:08 GMT from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on the country's east coast. The head of India's space agency told the BBC the mission would demonstrate the technological capability to reach Mars orbit and carry out experiments. The spacecraft is set to travel for 300 days, reaching Mars orbit in 2014. If the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the US, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. In order for the MOM to embark on the right trajectory for its 300-day, 780-million km journey, it must carry out its final orbital burn by 30 November. Some observers are viewing the launch of the MOM, also known by the informal name of Mangalyaan (Mars-craft), as the latest salvo in a burgeoning space race between the Asian powers of India, China, Japan, South Korea and others. Prof Andrew Coates, from University College London's Mullard Space Science Laboratory, told BBC News: "I think this mission really brings India to the table of international space exploration. Interplanetary exploration is certainly not trivial to do, and [India] has found some interesting scientific niches to make some measurements in." Those niche areas include searching for the signature of methane (CH4) in the Martian atmosphere, which has previously been detected from Martian orbit and telescopes on Earth. However, Nasa's Curiosity rover recently failed to find the gas in its measurements of atmospheric gases. CH4 has a short lifetime in the Martian atmosphere, meaning that some source on the Red Planet must replenish it. Intriguingly, some 95% of atmospheric methane on Earth is produced by microbes, which has led some to propose the possibility of a biosphere deep beneath the Martian surface. But the gas can be produced by geological processes too, most notably by volcanism. Definitive conclusions are likely to be elusive, but the spacecraft's Methane Sensor for Mars (MSM) instrument will aim to make measurements and map any potential sources of methane "plumes". The spacecraft will also examine the rate of loss of atmospheric gases to outer space. This could provide insights into the planet's history; billions of years ago, the envelope of gases around Mars is thought to have been more substantial. At $72m (£45m), the mission is comparatively cheap, but some commentators have still questioned whether a country with one of the highest rankings for childhood malnutrition in the world should be spending millions on a mission to the Red Planet. In one sense, India was left in a quandary because of the failure of its most powerful launcher, the first choice to loft the MOM into orbit. It meant the country's space agency could no longer fire the satellite directly out of Earth's atmosphere. As a fuel-saving alternative, the spacecraft will circle Earth in an elliptical orbit for nearly a month, building up the necessary velocity to break free from our planet's gravitational pull. The formal name for the route MOM will take to Mars is a "Hohmann Transfer Orbit". The spacecraft takes advantage of a favourable planetary alignment, carrying out six small engine burns over November to lift it to a higher orbit before a final burn sends it off on an interplanetary trajectory. The difficulty of visiting the Red Planet will not be lost on Indian officials; just under half the total attempts to reach Mars have succeeded. But Prof Coates said the planned mechanics for getting to Mars were on a sound footing, and that the probe stood a good chance as long as its engines fired correctly. Those who defend India's current direction in space exploration say the technological development required to mount this mission could indirectly benefit the country's other activities, including poverty reduction. Nisha Agrawal, chief executive of Oxfam in India, told the BBC: "India is home to poor people but it's also an emerging economy, it's a middle-income country, it's a member of the G20. What is hard for people to get their head around is that we are home to poverty but also a global power. "We are not really one country but two in one. And we need to do both things: contribute to global knowledge as well as take care of poor people at home." K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), told the BBC's India Business Report: "Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: 'It is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society.' He added: "A great revolution has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme." Mr Radhakrishnan played down talk of a race between China and India in space, commenting: "We are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services." But a successful launch would allow India to surge ahead of regional rival China, at least in the exploration of Mars. China's Yinghuo-1 spacecraft was to have reached Martian orbit in late 2012. But it was piggybacked on the Russian Phobos Grunt spacecraft, which became stranded in low-Earth orbit shortly after launch in November 2011. The MOM was to have been launched as early as 28 October, but rough weather in the Pacific forced officials to postpone lift-off. </body>

      <body>A prostate cancer test, which predicts how aggressive a tumour is, could spare men unnecessary operations, researchers suggest. Early data, presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference, suggests a genetic test can tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours. A big challenge in treating the cancer is knowing whether surgery to remove the gland is needed. Cancer charities said a successful test would be a "game-changer". Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in the UK. There are more than 40,000 new cases diagnosed and 10,000 deaths each year. The decision to remove the prostate is based on an examination of a tumour sample under the microscope. However, the procedure has significant side-effects such as infertility, difficulty maintaining and keeping an erection and uncontrolled urinating. One of the researchers, Prof Dan Berney, from Queen Mary University of London, told the BBC: "We need a better test as we are over-treating many men; most will die with, not of, prostate cancer. "We need to discriminate between the aggressive forms and those that will grumble along and just need monitoring." The commercial test, developed by Myriad Genetics but independently assessed by Queen Mary University of London, looks at the activity level of genes inside a sample of the tumour. If 31 genes involved in controlling how cells divide are highly active, it indicates the cancer is aggressive. Prof Berney said such information could "substantially change" decisions made by doctors and patients but the costs were "huge" and it was certainly not going to be offered on the NHS in the next few years. "We need to validate it and we're not there yet, but it is the strongest test we've had so far," he added. Dr Iain Frame, director of research at Prostate Cancer UK, said: "Developing an effective test to distinguish aggressive from non-aggressive prostate cancer could be a game-changer for those affected by the condition. "We urgently need to reach a point where we can focus resources on saving more of the 10,000 men who lose their lives to this disease every year, whilst sparing the many others who needn't have concerns. "The results of this study are certainly intriguing, and take us a step closer to the diagnostic process for prostate cancer that men deserve. We will watch with great interest developments in this area." Dr Harpal Kumar, the chief executive of Cancer Research UK, said: "Being able to tell apart aggressive and slow-growing tumours would help us take a major step forward in prostate cancer treatment. "Understanding more about the nature of a patient's tumour could spare thousands of men from unnecessary treatment and the resulting side-effects, whilst also meaning that those who do need treatment receive it rapidly." </body>

      <body>A rare solar eclipse allowing a view of the Sun that is totally or partially blocked by the Moon has taken place. It was first visible in the southern United States, before sweeping east across the Atlantic Ocean and the African continent. The US space agency, Nasa, said the greatest total eclipse occurred over the Atlantic Ocean. One of the best views was in northern Kenya, where tour companies organised trips to view a total blackout. Local myths there attribute the event to the Moon eating the Sun. Partial views were available in eastern North America and southern Europe. This solar eclipse was a rare occurrence in that it was "hybrid" - switching between an annular and total eclipse. In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the sun, while an annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is at its farthest from the Earth and does not block out the Sun completely, leaving a halo of sunlight still visible around the Moon. The eclipse event began about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Jacksonville, Florida with an annular eclipse visible for four seconds at sunrise. As the Moon's shadow raced east the eclipse switched from annular to total along a narrow corridor. The greatest total eclipse occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 330km south-west of Liberia, and lasted for more than one minute. The eclipse continued across Africa through the Congos until it passed through northern Uganda and northern Kenya, ending in southern Ethiopia and Somalia. Either side, a partial eclipse was seen within a much broader path including eastern North America, northern South America, southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Experts warned that no-one should attempt to view the Sun with the naked eye. A safe view of eclipses can be obtained by using special welder's glasses or a pinhole camera. </body>

      <body>The company building Britain's first nuclear power station in a generation has denied a suggestion that the new plant would use controversial MOX fuel. French state-owned utility EDF said the use of plutonium-based Mixed Oxide fuel was not under consideration for use at the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset. Under questioning by the Public Accounts Committee, Mark Higson from the Office for Nuclear Development, said MOX could be used. Mr Higson was speaking on 4 November. The OND chief executive told the committee that MOX fuel could be used "in power stations yet to be built. The EPR reactor at Hinkley, for example". MOX is nuclear fuel that contains more than one oxide of fissile material. It often consists of plutonium along with uranium, from either natural, reprocessed or depleted sources. EDF, which wants to use French reactor technology backed by Chinese money at Hinkley, responded quickly to the statement, saying it was not correct and that using MOX was not even a consideration. In a statement, an EDF spokesman said: "We have not used MOX in any of our stations and have no plans to do so in the future in our existing stations or new nuclear stations." Mixed oxide fuel was contrived as a method of getting rid of Britain's stockpile of civil plutonium - the largest in the world - accumulated from years of reprocessing foreign and UK nuclear waste. But there is no active plan to dispose of the material, which is now seen as a terrorism target and a proliferation risk because it can be used to make nuclear bombs. Turning plutonium into MOX fuel was thought to be the answer. But the Sellafied MOX plant built to make it failed dramatically at a cost of £1.4bn and was closed in 2011. A planned new MOX facility has a price tag of between £5bn and £6bn to the taxpayer. But the business case is controversial. To the astonishment of MPs on the committee, Mr Higson explained: "The value of the fuel, we would expect to be less than the cost of operating and building the MOX plant." In other words, it would be done purely to dispose of the plutonium, with no certain market for the fuel. EDF says it won't use MOX and Horizon, the other major nuclear company hoping to build reactors in the UK, which is backed by the Japanese firm Hitachi, said it has no plans to use MOX either. Steve Thomas, professor of energy policy at Greenwich University, commented: "MOX is a nuclear fuel invented by governments to address the embarrassing problem of what to do with separated plutonium. It is expensive, difficult to handle and increases maintenance and storage costs, so utilities will always be very reluctant to use MOX unless forced to do so." A spokesman for Decc said the government's preferred option for dealing with plutonium remained MOX, but it appeared to row back on the statement made to MPs. "Mr Higson's reference to Hinkley was merely by way of example. The EPR is capable of burning MOX fuel. Actual use of MOX in Hinkley or any other new build reactors would need to be subject to commercial negotiations with operators concerned. Such commercial negotiations are naturally some way off as the reactors have yet to be built." The spokesman added that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority was also looking at alternative options. Hinkley is already controversial. Peter Atherton of the city firm Liberum Capital called it "the most expensive power station in the world (excluding hydro schemes)". Criticism has focused on the government decision to allow EDF to charge £92.50 per Megawatt-hour (MWh), twice the current market rate for the electricity which, because it is index linked, would be nearer £121 per MWh by the time the plant opens. That could earn the French and Chinese state-owned firms up to £80bn over the life of the plant. A controversy over MOX fuel could be the last thing they need. </body>

      <title>Farming key to closing emissions gap</title>
      <description>A new study suggests that simple changes to agriculture could play a significant role in plans to cut global greenhouse emissions by 2020.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24817837</url>

      <body>Changing farming practices could play an important role in averting dangerous climate change says the UN. In their annual emissions report, they measure the difference between the pledges that countries have made to cut warming gases and the targets required to keep temperatures below 2C. On present trends there is likely to be an annual excess of 8 to 12 gigatonnes of these gases by 2020. Agriculture, they say, could make a significant difference to the gap. This is the fourth such report, compiled by the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) in conjunction with 44 scientific groups in 17 countries. It says the world needs to reduce total emissions to 44 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent by 2020 to keep the planet from going above the 2C target, agreed at a UN meeting in Cancun in 2010. But when all the pledges and plans made by countries are added together, they show an excess of between 8 and 12 gigatonnes per annum in seven years time, very similar to last year's report. To put it in context, 12 gigatonnes is about 80% of all the emissions coming from all the power plants in the world right now. The authors highlight a number of ways in which this gap can be closed, including tightening the rules for counting emissions and expanding the scope of pledges already made. They believe around half the gap could be closed in this way. But they say that simple changes in agriculture could cut emissions by four gigatonnes, about two thirds of the remaining difference. Emissions from farming, including nitrous oxide from applying fertiliser and CO2 from ploughing fields accounts for more than 10% of the global total right now. "The potential is enormous," said Dr Joseph Alcamo from the UN Environment Programme. "It's not with anything very exotic, it has to do with the way we apply fertilisers to our fields, it has to do with conservation tillage so you don't plough the fields very rigorously." Conservation tillage includes a number of methods including leaving the previous year's crop residues on the fields to help protect the soils. The UN cited the example of Argentina where 100 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions have been avoided by a shift to conservation tillage that took place in the 1990s. They argue that not only would it curb global warming, it would help poor farmers as well. "You could take a big step down the pathway of sustainable agriculture," said Dr Alcamo, "You can unite ideas of sustainable agriculture for the whole world together with ideas of controlling emissions by 2020." The report highlighted a number of other measures that could bridge the looming gap including energy efficiency, greater emphasis on renewables and reform of fossil fuel subsidies. "A lot of these actions have been done not for climate mitigation but to further national and local interest," said Dr Alcamo. The study makes the point that if action on curbing greenhouse gases isn't taken in the short term, then the possibilities of getting emissions down in the future becomes much more difficult. "Remember 44 gigatonnes by 2020 just sets the stage for further cuts that will be needed," said Unep executive director Achim Steiner. "We need 40 gigatonnes by 2025, 35 gigatonnes by 2030 and 22 gigatonnes by 2050. "At the moment the trend is in the opposite direction, we are over 50 gigatonnes." Next week, delegates from all over the world will gather in Warsaw to continue negotiations on a new global climate agreement that is expected to be signed in 2015. According to Mr Steiner, the emissions gap report shows just how much needs to be done. "This report provides a very sobering perspective of where we are and still heading and quite how far- reaching the implications are of maintaining this trajectory." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Coastal retreat plan to curb floods</title>
      <description>The UK's largest ever coastal flood realignment sees a part of the West Sussex coast given back to the sea to increase protection.</description>

      <body>A scheme to combat flooding by surrendering land to the sea will be completed on Monday on the south coast. The £28m "managed realignment" at Medmerry in West Sussex has seen the building of 7km (four miles) of new sea walls up to 2km inland. By letting the waters in, the Environment Agency says the risk of flooding for hundreds of homes will be reduced. The surrendered land will become a wetland habitat for many species. The sea has long been a threatening presence on the flat land of the Manhood Peninsula that juts into the English channel on the coast between Portsmouth and Worthing. Caravan parks in Selsey and Bracklesham Bay have been flooded a number of times in recent years, as the shingle defences have yielded to the surging seas. Since 2011, the Environment Agency have been working on a plan that they believe curbs that threat. The project is billed as the country's largest ever coastal flood realignment scheme, but it has required the destruction of the existing sea wall at Medmerry and giving back to the sea some of the land nearest to the coast. "We have made a hole in the sea wall," the Environment Agency's flood and coastal risk manager, Andrew Gilham, told BBC News on a visit to the site. "But before doing that we've actually built 7km of new defences further inland from the coast. What we've been able to create here is an area that can absorb the energy of the waves and reduce the flood risk to people." Although the new walls are much closer to local communities, the Agency says homes are much better protected as a result, with the development able to withstand a once in a thousand year flood. The change is partly being forced on the Agency because of EU legislation that requires compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat through development. The Medmerry scheme makes up for the loss of similar conservation areas in and around the Solent. "It is not politically driven," said Mr Gilham. "But the benefit of creating the habitat here is not only to reduce flood risk in this area but also to reduce flood risk to communities in Portsmouth and Southampton. "If we weren't able create habitat here we wouldn't be be able to do those defences." The scale of the £28m development is enormous. Between the new earthen walls and the sea stand 183 hectares of land that the Agency says will rapidly become a saltwater marsh, with potentially huge benefits for wildlife in the area. It will be managed by the RSPB. "Even in construction, we're seeing lots of migratory birds using this area," said Andrew Gilham. "It is already starting to be used by the wildlife. It's a massive nature reserve and a massive opportunity on the south coast." Local people are hoping that letting the sea in will not only protect their homes but boost the local economy as well. Alan Chamberlain is the estate manager of the newly renamed Medmerry Park holiday village. His business, located next door to the new habitat, is actually below sea level. "In the past we have been very close to flooding, and now we've got a one-in-one-thousand-year protection, one of the best in the country actually," he told BBC News. "For us it's a win win, it will encourage visitors to the site, birdwatchers and those interested in nature." The new development is facing its first big test on the day it opens as it will see one of the highest tides of the year. But the Environment Agency are fully confident it will pass with flying colours. Medmerry is one of a number of managed realignment projects that the Environment Agency are involved in. Andrew Gilham says it's part of a new approach. "Rather than fighting it, we are working with nature," he explained. "It's an important change in approach, you can only keep building bigger and bigger defences for so long. We have to ask if we can make better use of public money. "Certainly the habitat we are creating here is important to the broader ecosystem and the broader economy of the country by encouraging people to visit remote areas." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>'Platypus-zilla' found in Australia</title>
      <description>Part of a giant platypus fossil, dubbed platypus-zilla, is unearthed in Australia, scientists report.</description>

      <body>Part of a giant platypus fossil has been unearthed in Queensland, Australia. Scientists have dubbed the beast "platypus-zilla" and believe it would have measured more than 1m long (3ft). Writing in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology, the researchers say the creature lived between five and 15 million years ago. The discovery suggests the evolutionary back-story of today's platypus is more complicated than was thought. Prof Mike Archer, from the University of New South Wales, said: "Suddenly up pops 'playtpus-zilla' - this gigantic monstrosity that you would have been afraid to swim with. "It indicates there are branches in the platypus family tree that we hadn't suspected before." Today, all that survives of this platypus is a single fossilised tooth, which was unearthed in the Riversleigh fossil beds in northwest Queensland. Based on its size, the researchers have estimated that the new species (Obdurodon tharalkooschild) would have been at least twice as large as today's platypus. Bumps on its teeth and other fossil finds nearby suggest that the creature feasted on crustaceans, turtles, frogs and fish. Although the area where the molar was found is a desert, millions of years ago it would have been covered in forest. The researchers think the beast would have spent its time in and around freshwater ponds. Prof Archer said that with just one tooth, it was difficult to work out exactly what this species would have looked like. However other fossils suggest that it could have shared the same bizarre appearance as today's platypuses, with their duck-like bills, large webbed feet and poisonous spurs. But this would have been on a much larger scale. "I guess it probably would have looked like a platypus on steroids," said Prof Archer. Fossil platypus finds are in short supply, with just a few fragments found throughout the southern hemisphere. As a result, there are many gaps in our understanding of the creature's past. Prof Archer said: "We have been naively led to suspect that maybe it was just one lineage of strange animals bumbling its way through time and space at least for the last 60 million years. "The discovery of this new one was a bit of a shock to us. It was a wake-up call that the platypus's story, the more we know about it, is increasingly more complicated than we thought." The researchers are now hoping to find more platypus fossils in the same area to try to shed more light these enigmatic Australian animals. Follow Rebecca on Twitter </body>

      <title>Trees help at-risk species keep cool</title>
      <description>Dense tree canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study shows.</description>

      <body>Forests with dense canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study has shown. Researchers found plants that favoured cooler conditions fared better under dense canopies than in ones that were more open to the elements. They added that these conditions could be a "critical mechanism" in the conservation of forest plant diversity. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A team of international researchers, headed by scientists from Belgium, noted that previous studies had shown that "biological signals of recent global warming" had been increasing across an array of ecosystems. "Around the globe, climate warming is increasing the dominance of warm-adapted species - a process described as 'thermophilisation'," they observed. The team gathered data from vegetation survey from more than 1,400 plots in temperate forests across North America and Europe. In each plot, they compared the results from an original survey with a repeated survey that was, on average, carried out 34.5 years later. The results showed that there had been a sizeable turnover, with about one-third of the species present in the original survey being replaced by other plants. Shaded sanctuary However, they also found that the thermophilisation of vegetation was lowest in forests where canopies had become denser. "These results suggest that recent forest canopy closure in northern hemisphere temperate forests has buffered the impacts of macroclimate warming on ground-layer plant communities, thus slowing changes in community composition," they wrote. As well as lowering temperatures, the dense canopy cover also increased relative air humidity and shade within forests' understorey. The researchers explained that these conditions also offered protection to forest herbs and tree seedlings from summer drought, "decreasing mortality and thus buffering the impacts of large-scale climate change". They noted that in western Europe, a number of factors - such as changes to management regimes - had resulted in increased tree growth and forest densities. "Logging and natural losses of tree biomass have been consistently lower than annual growth increments, resulting in an almost doubling of standing stocks of trees per hectare between 1950 and 2000," they wrote. Temperate forests account for about 16% of the world's tree cover, while understorey plants account for 80% of the flora diversity found in these habitats. Co-author Keith Kirby, a woodland ecologist from the University of Oxford's Department of Plant Sciences, said the microclimate created by a dense forest canopy allowed some plants to remain within their comfort zone. However, he warned: "The other thing we must remember is that this moderating characteristic only works as long as you have got the canopy there. "At some stage, the trees themselves may die from disease, they may get felled or they themselves might succumb to the effects of climate change. "Once that happens, what we might then see is that the ground flora might start to shift quite rapidly, so we might have things keeping relatively stable for quite a while but then we pass a tipping point once the canopy opens up." After a prolonged post-war hiatus, traditional woodland management techniques - such as coppicing - are becoming popular once again. But Dr Kirby told BBC News that this study's findings suggested that a more considered approach might be needed. He observed: "This might be a case to say hold on a minute because if we start coppicing and opening up the canopies, we will also be exposing these plants to future climate change more. "Maybe in the future we should be reducing the extent that we break up canopies." But he added that perhaps "the gentle intervention" of management techniques was needed in order to strengthen woodlands' resilience to the threats posed by pests, pathogens and extreme weather events. </body>

      <title>Views sought on countryside future</title>
      <description>The government launches a consultation for views on how the English countryside should look, as a controversial EU farm subsidy change is introduced.</description>

      <body>People are being asked to offer their views on how the English countryside should look. The government has opened a consultation on the priorities for spending nearly £20bn of EU subsidies over the next seven years. The budget has been cut overall and there is huge controversy about how it should be shared between helping farmers and protecting wildlife. The decisions will have an impact on hedgerows, trees, wild flowers, birds, bees, water quality and the appearance of the landscape. An EU settlement in the summer has given individual nations more discretion on how to spend funds. Some countries want to prioritise direct help for farmers, but the UK government says farmers should have to earn their cash as much as possible by working in a way that benefits the environment. Ministers want to divert the maximum amount of 15% into rural development and green schemes. They aim to help hill farmers and to create shelter for pollinators, such as bees and moths. But this has worried big farmers, who they say they will lose out and get less direct payment than some of their European counterparts. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) president, Peter Kendall, said: "English farmers are already significantly disadvantaged in comparison with their near neighbours in the EU." Environmentalists are not happy either. They argue the government's plans have failed to ensure that whole landscapes are farmed in a way that safeguards water quality and the environment. Helen Perkins from the Wildlife Trusts said: "We need to see farming for nature mainstreamed - with environmental standards raised on every farm so that exemplary practices aren't restricted to pockets of the countryside." Campaigners are perplexed that the government has given the public just 28 days to respond to the consultation on an immensely complex reform. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own processes over farm budgets. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin </body>

      <body>Two orphaned otter cubs are being cared for by the Scottish SPCA after being found in distress at Thurso beach in Caithness. The 10-week-old males were spotted by a member of the public. They were scared off by two dogs and were eventually found hiding under a wheelie bin in a nearby garden. Scottish SPCA senior inspector Audrey Gunn managed to trap the pair. They are receiving care at the charity's rescue centre in Clackmannanshire. The cubs, found on 26 October, have been named Thurso and Surf. Ms Gunn said: "Thurso and Surf were timid but curious and I paid a visit to the local fish shop to make sure they were well fed. "They were lucky to be found as otters are dependant on their mothers until they're around a year old and they wouldn't have been able to survive on their own." National Wildlife Rescue Centre manager Colin Seddon added: "Both cubs are well, albeit very frightened.

      <title>Badger cull fails to meet target</title>
      <description>Some 940 badgers were killed in total during a pilot cull, which was lower than the planned target, the government admits.</description>

      <body>One of the badger cull pilot schemes failed to meet its target - even after a three-week extension, the government has admitted. The cull ended last week, with an estimated 65% reduction in the badger population in the west Somerset cull zone - the target was 70%. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said 940 badgers were shot in total. A similar cull in Gloucestershire has been extended until 18 December. Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Owen Paterson said the two badger control pilots were "designed to test that controlled shooting is a safe, humane and effective means of reducing badger numbers". "I am announcing to the House that the three-week extension period in the Somerset control area concluded as planned on Friday 1st November," said Mr Paterson. "During this period, a further 90 badgers have been removed, giving an overall total of 940 for the first year of the four-year cull. "This will deliver clear disease benefits as part of a four-year cull in the area. "While conclusions will need to await the findings of the Independent Panel of Experts, current indications also suggest the pilot has been safe and humane." Ministers and the National Farmers' Union say badger culling is needed to control incidents of TB in cattle. About 28,000 cattle were slaughtered in 2012, at a cost of £100m to taxpayers. However, animal welfare groups say scientific evidence does not support the policy of shooting badgers in an attempt to control the disease. The Wildlife Trusts said the cull was a "complete failure" and should be halted. 'Badgers moved goalposts' "The failure to meet the targets is despite the estimates of the pre-cull badger numbers being twice revised significantly downwards," said Paul Wilkinson, from the charity. "Culling badgers over such a prolonged period and failing to meet the required targets is likely to have worsened the Bovine TB situation at a cost of millions of pounds, whilst putting the local badger populations at significant risk. "The pilot culls have departed completely from their original purpose of testing the method of free shooting, which was abandoned in favour of cage trapping." Shadow environment secretary Maria Eagle mocked Mr Paterson's previous claim that culling targets were missed because "the badgers have moved the goalposts". "By repeatedly moving the goalposts on his own policy, Owen Paterson has risked the further spread of TB due to prolonged disturbance of local badger populations," she said. "David Cameron should stop the unscientific mass culling of badgers now that Owen Paterson's misguided policy has clearly failed." </body>

      <body>A wild boar which has been on the loose in Alderney for more than a month is thought to have swum there from the nearby French coast. The boar found its way into a pig farm on Friday but, when approached, escaped by jumping over a 1m (3ft) stock fence. Farm owner Tess Woodnutt said she would not have believed the animal could jump so high from a standing start, if she had not seen it with her own eyes. Islanders have dubbed the boar "ghost pig", as it has only been seen at dusk. Mrs Woodnutt said she first became aware of the boar on 27 September, when she was on holiday and received a call from a fellow islander saying one of their 40 pigs had escaped. Her son Jake immediately went to the farm and soon established no pigs were missing. Steve Shaw, who was Alderney harbour master for 25 years, said he did not believe it would be possible for a wild boar to get to the island by boat without the crew noticing, and he had never heard of a wild boar being found on any vessel. Some islanders have speculated the animal could be an "iron age pig", which have been farmed on the island. However, Alan Woodnutt, Tess's husband, said he was certain it was not. "Iron age pigs are a cross between a wild boar and a Tamworth," he said. "They look a bit like a wild boar but this animal was not the progeny of an iron age pig." Mrs Woodnutt said the boar's arrival on the island was a mystery but she had had it confirmed to her by an expert in the UK that a wild boar could swim long distances in open water. Wild boar are commonly found in Normandy, the coast of which lies seven miles (11km) to the east of Alderney. Duty Insp Kieran McGrath from Guernsey Police said islanders should contact them if they spotted the animal and should not approach it themselves, as any wild boar could be dangerous when cornered. </body>

      <body>Scientists from the University of Manchester have created a "digital robot" of the biggest dinosaur ever to have walked the Earth - Argentinosaurus. This animated sauropod has shown the researchers how these creatures would have walked, showing that supporting their 80 tonne weight would have stretched muscle and bone to the limits of its capabilities. The team used a laser scan of the dinosaur's skeleton and mapped onto that its tendons and bones. Here, Dr Bill Sellers, who led the study, describes how the model was able to "learn how to walk".

      <body>The 100th anniversary of the death of Alfred Russel Wallace, the "forgotten hero" who co-discovered evolution, is being marked today in London. The first ever statue of the naturalist will be unveiled at the Natural History Museum by Sir David Attenborough. A new wasp genus - Wallaceaphytis - has been named in honour of the man who has been in Darwin's shadow ever since they co-published their theory in 1858. The wasp was discovered in Borneo, where Wallace carried out his research. "It seemed only fitting to name it in his honour, especially as it is the centenary of his death," said Dr Andrew Polaszek of the NHM, one of the expedition team who found the insect last year. They have published their discovery in the Journal of Natural History - the same annals in which Wallace published his famous paper on the origin of species - "the Sarawak Law". Just one millimetre long, the wasp belongs to a group known as parasitoids, which lay their eggs inside other insects or spiders. "Wallaceaphytis is so unusual that one of my volunteers called me over to the microscope saying 'this looks really strange'," Dr Polaszek told the BBC. "Not only is it a new species but also a completely new genus. And we found it in Wallace's old stomping ground." The incredible variety of insects Wallace discovered during his travels in the Malay Archipelago inspired his theory of evolution by natural selection. He described his ideas in an essay which he sent to Charles Darwin - who subsequently sought to co-publish his own independent version of the theory. But while there are many, many monuments to Darwin, there has never been a single one of Wallace - until today. A life-size bronze sculpture by Anthony Smith will be unveiled at the NHM by Sir David Attenborough. "For me, there is no more admirable character in the history of science," said Attenborough of Wallace, in a special BBC audio slideshow charting the explorer's life and legacy. The new statue is the result of a fundraising campaign by the Wallace Memorial Fund, which is holding a special day of talks, Consensus, in London on 16 November. It depicts the moment when Wallace first glimpsed the male of the golden birdwing butterfly (Ornithoptera croesus), on Bacan Island, Indonesia, in 1859. "The beauty and brilliancy of this insect are indescribable," wrote Wallace in his book The Malay Archipelago. "On taking it out of my net and opening the glorious wings, my heart began to beat violently, the blood rushed to my head, and I felt much more like fainting than I have done when in apprehension of immediate death. "I had a headache the rest of the day, so great was the excitement produced by what will appear to most people a very inadequate cause." </body>

      <title>Culling badgers? Call the 'paras'</title>
      <description>Can badger cull extensions do anything to help tackle TB?</description>

      <body>Fresh from leading his very own dessert campaign, Environment Secretary Owen Paterson is now doing his bit for "iconic species". And no, I don't mean badgers. Mr Paterson is visiting Kenya this week where he will announce that British Army paratroopers will provide training for members for local wildlife rangers in their fight against poaching. "Illegal poaching is having a devastating effect on some of the world's most iconic species and we must work together to tackle it," Mr Paterson said ahead of his visit. But perhaps the training and guidance that the paratroopers will be providing, could also be put to good effect back home? As well as details of Mr Paterson's safari to save endangered species, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) published his latest written ministerial statement on the badger cull taking place in Gloucestershire and West Somerset. You'll recall that in both pilot areas, the culling companies were forced to apply to Natural England for extra time to meet the 70% target stipulated in their licences. In West Somerset the natural born cullers were authorised to kill an extra 165 badgers in the three weeks of added time. They managed to shoot an extra 90. So instead of the 70% needed to reduce the incidence of TB in cattle, the men of the night managed to get to 65%. Perhaps with some of that paratrooper training, they would have hit the target? Or maybe those dastardly poachers could be persuaded to visit West Somerset and Gloucestershire? According to Mr Paterson, the failure to hit the magic number doesn't really matter. For this is but year one of a grand four-year plan. This is not to be confused with those old Soviet five-year plans where the harvests were always abundant, and the workers were always smiling. In his statement, Mr Paterson said the advice from the Chief Veterinary Officer "was that a further increase in the number of badgers culled after the initial six-week period would improve the disease control benefits achieved even further and enable them to accrue earlier. "With the further removal of badgers seen," Mr Paterson went on, "the extension has been successful in meeting this aim." So even if they had shot just one extra badger, would that also improve the disease control benefits? I'm getting a sense that goalposts might once again be in motion. Because just a year ago, when he was explaining to the House of Commons why the badger cull should be postponed, Mr Paterson was at pains to say that getting to this magic number was crucial to the success of the trial. "It would be wrong to go ahead if those on the ground cannot be confident of removing at least 70% of the populations," he said at the time. There's an old adage in boxing, that tactical plans go out the window when you get the first punch on the nose. It would appear that Mr Paterson's hooter has been shipping a few blows.

      <body>Colombia's Constitutional Court will decide on Thursday whether to reopen Bogota's famous bullfighting ring. In the lead up to the decision, the issue has been raging on social media. Colombians love social media. Anyone who's anyone in the world of politics, sport or celebrity in Colombia uses Twitter. And bullfighting is one of the hottest issues at the moment, says Camilo Andres Garcia, a journalist, high-profile Twitter user and social media commentator in Bogota, who is opposed to bullfighting. It's the blood when the bull dies that many Colombians find hard to deal with. There has been enough human blood shed during the country's decades-long conflict, he says. Bullfighting is associated with the elite in Colombia - and conjures up images of rich ranch owners and women in hats and fancy dresses. There are many high profile supporters of bullfighters - including a number of Colombian newspapers - but on social media, they appear to be losing the PR battle. There are two rival hashtags doing the rounds on Twitter in Colombia ahead of this court decision, #LasCorridasNOVuelvenABogota - bullfighting won't return to Bogota - and #VuelvenlosTorosaBogota - the bulls are coming back to Bogota. The anti-crowd's voice is far louder though (12,000 tweets on their hashtag, versus fewer than 200 on the pro-side at the time of writing). "It's a very important decision for our family," says Diana Carolina Baquero Hernandez, a journalist and bullfighting radio host. Her family's history is bound up with Bogota's bullfighting ring, Plaza la Santamaria. Her father's uncle was once the manager, and many of her relatives were born and grew up inside the stadium. "Bullfighting is our life, our passion, our tradition," she says. Baquero-Hernandez has set up a Facebook page in support of bullfighting, but it's small-scale, and she admits her side is being drowned out. She says many who criticise bullfighting are ill-informed. "I feel angry sometimes because I feel people don't understand the real meaning of bullfighting. Bullfighting is an art." Reporting by Cordelia Hebblethwaite Have you spotted an interesting trend?

      <title>How the Mars mission helps India</title>
      <description>What a mission to Mars means for India</description>

      <body>India's launch of a small unmanned satellite to Mars is being described as a giant leap for its space programme. Science writer Pallava Bagla writes on what the mission means for India and the world. If all goes well and the satellite orbits the Red Planet, India's space agency will become the fourth in the world after those of the United States, Russia and Europe to undertake a successful Mars mission. India's 1,350kg (2,976lb) robotic satellite which is undertaking the 10-month-long, over 200-million-kilometre journey to Mars is equipped with five instruments. They include a sensor to track methane or marsh gas - a possible sign of life - on Mars, a colour camera for taking pictures, and a thermal imaging spectrometer to map the surface and mineral wealth of the planet. The mission will also analyse the thin Martian atmosphere. After India's successful unmanned Chandrayaan mission to the Moon in 2008 that brought back the first clinching evidence of the presence of water there, the Mars mission, according to K Radhakrishnan, chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), is a "natural progression". More than 500 scientists from the Bangalore-based Isro worked round the clock on this $73m (£45m) mission, which was announced by PM Manmohan Singh in August last year. Project chief Subbiah Arunan says he has not taken a vacation in the last 15 months, sleeping at Isro's satellite centre in Bangalore and going home for "about one or two hours every day". So does India's Mars mission mark the beginning of a new Asian space race? India sees the Mars mission as an opportunity to beat its regional rival China in reaching the planet, especially after a Russian mission carrying the first Chinese satellite to Mars failed in November 2011. Japan also failed in a similar effort in 1998. China has beaten India in space in almost every aspect so far: it has rockets that can lift four times more weight than India's, and in 2003, successfully launched its first human space flight which India has not yet embarked on. China launched its maiden mission to the Moon in 2007, ahead of India. So if India's mission succeeds, it will have something to feel proud about. "National pride is important. If the Mars mission succeeds, it will be a big morale booster for India. We are not in a space race," says SK Shivakumar, director of Isro's Bangalore-based satellite centre. The risks can be high in a space race. Since 1960 about 40 missions to Mars have been launched, more than half of which have failed. And no nation - apart from Mars Express, Europe's maiden venture to Mars representing 20 countries - has succeeded in its maiden venture. Though India says its Mars mission is the cheapest inter-planetary mission ever to have been undertaken in half a century of space exploration, some are questioning its scientific purpose. "This is a highly suboptimal mission with limited scientific objectives," says D Raghunandan of Delhi Science Forum, a think tank. Others like economist-activist Jean Dreze have said the mission "seems to be part of the Indian elite's delusional quest for superpower status". Rejecting such talk, a top government official says: "We have heard these arguments since the 1960s, about India being a poor country not needing or affording a space programme. "If we can't dare to dream big it would leave us as hewers of wood and drawers of water! India is today too big to be just living on the fringes of high technology."

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <body>India is preparing to send a robotic spacecraft into orbit around Mars - a first for the country. Yogita Limaye from the BBC's India Business Report spoke to K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) - the country's space agency - about his hopes for the mission. A: Essentially in this Mars mission, which we are planning, the prime objective is to demonstrate India's capability to capture the Martian orbit and then to conduct a few meaningful scientific experiments. A: See, essentially when we talk about Mars and exploration of Mars, you look at life as one of those goals. So (we look for) the presence of methane in the Martian environment and see whether this methane, if it is there, has a biological origin or a geological origin. We also would like to study the Martian atmosphere and the escape processes there. A: No, see Curiosity is measuring the presence of methane in a small area where it is there today. We are talking about the entire Martian environment. So Curiosity saying "no" is not a point to be worried about. A: Any mission to Mars has to be done in an opportune window and the imminent window is November 2013, that is we need to get out of this sphere of influence of earth by 30 November to ensure that we have the minimum distance between Earth and Mars. Now we are launching this Mars orbiter from Sriharikota in the east coast of India in the first week of November and then the PSLV-XL (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) is used for the launch which will put this orbiter into an elliptical orbit around the Earth... then around the last week of November, we have a crucial operation, it's called the "trans-Martian injection" where the spacecraft is directed towards Mars. Then it is a long voyage of 300 days where the orbiter spacecraft passes through the sphere of influence of the Earth... Then it goes through a long phase of heliocentric flight where the orbiter spacecraft will be influenced not only by the Sun but by the other planets too. Then as it approaches Mars... we have another major action: capturing the orbit of Mars, which is on 21st of September 2014. A: Soon after the orbiter is put into the orbit of Mars, we would start the experimentation and even before this orbiter reaches the Martian environment we would be calibrating these instruments as it travels from Earth to Mars. But the most important part of it is looking at the distances involved. It takes at least 20 minutes for any signal to come from the Mars orbiter to Earth in some phases. It could be anything between four to 20 minutes one-way. A: Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: "it is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society." And in this area, India has become a role model for the whole world. Let me talk in terms of numbers. We spend in India about a billion dollars for the space programme. If we look at the central government expenditure, we spend 0.34% of its budget for the space programme. This goes primarily for building satellites in communications and remote sensing and navigation for space applications. Nearly 35% of it goes on launch vehicle development and about 7-8% goes on the science and exploration programme. So the Mars mission we're talking about today is part of that 8% of the 0.34% of Indian central government expenditure. And if you look at the benefit that the country has accrued over the years, it has surpassed the money that has been spent in terms of tangible and intangible benefits. [This can be expressed in terms of] the advantage that the people have got, the fishermen have got, the farmers have got, the government bodies have got for informed decision-making, the support the country has got for disaster management and by providing a communication infrastructure for this country using the INSAT satellites. Today we have nearly 10 communication satellites and 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. This is a great revolution that has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme. A: See, Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter, but Chandrayaan-2 as you said looks at the surface of the Moon using a rover and a landing module there. In 2009-2010, we planned this as a joint mission where India was to provide the launch and the orbiter and Russia was to provide the lander and the rover. Over these years there has been a programmatic realignment on this and, as of now, the plan is that the rover will be made by India and the lander will also be developed by India, and we must have this lander developed by the year 2016. Now, we also require a reliable GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket) for launching Chandrayaan-2. In December 2013, we are going to launch the GSLV T5 rocket with our own cryogenic engine stage. If that is successful, and we are able to have one more successful flight of the GSLV, then we would be ready - from the launch angle - for Chandrayaan-2. So, this is the scenario emerging and there will be scientific experiments in the lander module and in the rover, and a few in the orbiter too. Yes, 2016 is the correct target and the limiting factor for that is the development of the lander module. A: See, as of now we have no declared programme on human space flight, but in the year 2006-07 we began a study... and as of now we have taken up the critical new technologies that India needs to master a human space flight. The core module development, environment control and life support systems, the crew escape system, these are all part of that and we are working on it at the moment. But we require a human-rated vehicle that is capable of taking the crew module into a lower orbit. So you need to have a reliable GSLV for a manned mission or a GSLV Mark 3 developed and then manned-rated. A: As of now, there is no timeline for a mission but we are working on the development of the critical technologies required for it. A: Let me first say each country has its own priorities and focus. Right from the beginning, right from the early sixties, India's focus has been on peaceful uses of outer space and space applications and there India is today a role model for the whole world. One can be proud of it. China has its own priorities and it is moving in that direction. So, we are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services. We need to do it more cost-effectively and deliver it to the target audience in the country, whether it is to the people or the government or other agencies in the country. So that has been the focus of the Indian space programme. This interview has been abridged for reasons of article length. </body>

      <title>Thorium backed as a 'future fuel'</title>
      <description>Could thorium usher in a new era of nuclear power?</description>

      <body>Nuclear scientists are being urged by the former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix to develop thorium as a new fuel. Mr Blix says that the radioactive element may prove much safer in reactors than uranium. It is also more difficult to use thorium for the production of nuclear weapons. His comments will add to growing levels of interest in thorium, but critics warn that developing new reactors could waste public funds. Mr Blix, the former Swedish foreign minister, told BBC News: "I’m a lawyer not a scientist but in my opinion we should be trying our best to develop the use of thorium. I realise there are many obstacles to be overcome but the benefits would be great. "I am told that thorium will be safer in reactors - and it is almost impossible to make a bomb out of thorium. These are very major factors as the world looks for future energy supplies." His enthusiasm is shared by some in the British nuclear establishment. Scientists at the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) have been encouraged by the government to help research on an Indian thorium-based reactor, and on a test programme in Norway. The Norway tests at the OECD’s nuclear trials facility in Halden are conducted in a Bond-style underground bunker. A couple of charming Nordic homes perch on top of a hill at the edge of the town. Below them a garage door in a cliff face leads into a tunnel deep into the hill where the reactor hall lies. In theory, at least, the mountain protects the town from an accident. The thorium tests are being carried out by a private firm, Thor Energy (the element itself was discovered in Norway in 1828 and named after the Norse god of thunder). The company hopes to get thorium licensed alongside uranium in current water-cooled reactor plants. The British government says it would be useful to increase the fuel options for nuclear operators, as thorium is believed to be three times more plentiful than uranium. It is also currently being produced as a by-product from mining rare earths. Staff from NNL have been advising Thor on the use of mixed oxide fuels (MOX). NNL has also been helping the Indian authorities develop a thorium reactor, as India sits on top of the world’s biggest thorium reserves. The Thor project represents an evolutionary approach, using thorium in existing reactors together with uranium or plutonium. Oystein Asphjell, chief executive of Thor Energy told BBC News: "There is lots of thorium in the world, very well distributed all over the globe. In operations, in a reactor, it has some chemical and physical properties that make it really superior to uranium as well. On the waste side, we don’t generate long lived waste." China is going for a revolutionary approach, devising a next-generation reactor which its supporters say will enable thorium to be used much more safely than uranium. When a uranium reactor overheats and the fuel rods can’t contain the chain reaction, as happened at Fukushima, the crisis continues. If something happened to a thorium reactor, technicians could simply switch off the stimulus which comes from uranium or plutonium in a small feeder plant and the thorium reaction would halt itself. Prof Carlo Rubbia from Cern previously told BBC News: "Thorium will be able to shut itself off without any human intervention... You just switch off the beam.” "There are also no long-lived waste products... We estimate that after something like 400-500 years all the radioactivity will be dissipated away." These advantages, if they were realised, would be huge. But thorium still has many technical problems to overcome. What is more, countless billions have been ploughed into uranium-based research and development, and in the words of Mr Blix, uranium has a very deep furrow, backed by vested interests. Canada, China, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the UK and the US have experimented with thorium as a substitute fuel in the past. Questions are being raised, though, about the advisability of pinning the world’s energy ambitions on another nuclear dream. Environmentalists often allege that if renewable power had commanded a fraction as much research funding as nuclear it would already be much cheaper and more common. Dr Nils Bohmer, a nuclear physicist working for a Norwegian environmental NGO, Bellona, said developing thorium was a costly distraction from the need to cut emissions immediately to stave off the prospect of dangerous climate change. "The advantages of thorium are purely theoretical," he told BBC News. "The technology development is decades in the future. Instead I think we should focus on developing renewable technology - for example offshore wind technology - which I think has a huge potential to develop.” If thorium ever makes it as a commercial nuclear fuel, uranium may be seen as a massive and costly diversion. Some supporters of thorium believe that it was bypassed in the past because governments wanted the plutonium from certain conventional reactors to make atomic bombs. They believe thorium was rejected because it was simply too safe. Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <title>Disney fixes Star Wars release date</title>
      <description>The Walt Disney Company announces it will release the next Star Wars film on 18 December 2015 as it reports better-than-expected earnings.</description>

      <body>The Walt Disney Company has announced it will release the next Star Wars film on 18 December 2015. Disney bought Lucasfilm, the company behind Star Wars, from creator George Lucas last year for $4bn (£2.6bn). It has committed to making at least three new films in the series, one of the most successful franchises ever. Disney announced the release date as it reported a better-than-expected 12% jump in net profit for the three months to 28 September. It made a net profit of $1.39bn during the quarter, up from $1.24bn during the same period last year. The company also reported that its net income for the financial year to 28 September jumped 8% from a year ago to $6.1bn. "We're extremely pleased with our results for Fiscal 2013, delivering record revenue, net income and earnings per share for the third year in a row," Robert Iger, chief executive of the firm, said in a statement. Disney's movie studio business saw a 7% jump in revenues during the fourth quarter. Revenues rose to $1.5bn during the period, helped mainly by the strong performance of Monsters University, which Disney said "partially offset" the weak showing of The Lone Ranger. However, operating income at Disney's cable network unit, which includes the ESPN sports channel, fell by 7% to $1.3bn in the last quarter, which the firm said was due to the timing of some ESPN affiliate fee revenues. </body>

      <title>US writer claims Dylan Thomas Prize</title>
      <description>American short story writer Claire Vaye Watkins is named as the winner of the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for new writers.</description>

      <body>American short story writer Claire Vaye Watkins has been named the 2013 winner of the £30,000 Dylan Thomas Prize for new writers. Judges said she was an "exceptional" writer and described her collection Battleborn as "infectious". The California-born 29-year-old was one of seven writers aged under 30 shortlisted for the prize. The prize, based in Thomas's birthplace of Swansea, is one of the largest literary cash awards in the world. "It has been such an honour and a treat to be part of this," Ms Watkins said. "I'm grateful for every single reader I have. "It was not written for New York or London, it was written for people like you and Dylan, and anyone else that's been told their place doesn't matter." Ms Watkins was presented with her prize at a ceremony at the city's National Waterfront Museum. "Claire Vaye Watkins has some of Dylan Thomas's extraordinary skill in the short story form of giving you a perfect vision of a complete world and that's extraordinarily rare," said the chair of this year's judging panel, Hay Festival founder Peter Florence. Singer and broadcaster Cerys Matthews, also on the judging panel, added: "Battleborn just bubbles. She is such a natural writer. "The whole book is so infectious - it leaves you looking forward to what is coming next from this exceptional young author." The collection of short stories in Battleborn examines some of the myths of the American west, from how a man responds to finding a cache of letters and pills on the roadside, to sisters unable to comfort each other following their mother's suicide. "How exciting is it that in the year when Alice Munro is the greatest exponent of the modern short story by winning the Nobel Prize in Literature, that the Dylan Thomas Prize finds another truly remarkable short story writer in Claire Vaye Watkins?" said another judge, Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson. "At aged just 29 years old, she is truly gifted." Cultural historian Peter Stead, chair of the Dylan Thomas Prize, said this year's shortlist was the strongest it had ever had. "We admired all the books and in the adjudication we discussed them all at length. There were several books in contention but our choice of Battleborn was unanimous," he said. The judging panel considered three novels, two poetry collections, and two short story collections. Thursday's prizewinner announcement follows a week of events involving all seven shortlisted writers, known as the DylanED programme. It has seen them visit schools and universities across Wales to give readings and take part in creative writing workshops. Those taking part included the one Welsh writer on the shortlist, Jemma King. She was nominated for the prize for her collection of poems, The Shape of a Forest. </body>

      <title>Clegg takes aim at 'sneering' Paxman</title>
      <description>Deputy PM Nick Clegg criticises BBC presenter Jeremy Paxman for spending "all his time sneering at politics" when he "lives off politics".</description>

      <body>Nick Clegg has criticised Newsnight presenter Jeremy Paxman's "sneering" attitude towards politicians. The deputy PM said the presenter made a living off politics but treated all politicians as "rogues and charlatans". His comments follow Paxman's admission that he did not vote at a recent election because he had found the parties "unappetising". The presenter also called the Lib Dem tuition fees U-turn "the most blatant lie in recent political history". Mr Clegg conceded politics was imperfect but asserted that "of course you should vote". The Lib Dem leader, appearing on his regular LBC radio phone-in, said that not voting in elections was a total "abdication of responsibility". On Newsnight last month, presenter Jeremy Paxman berated comedian Russell Brand, who has urged revolution and non-participation in elections, for not bothering to vote. But Paxman later admitted he did not vote in a recent election "because I thought the choice so unappetising". Mr Clegg said: "Here is a guy who gets paid a million pounds, thereabouts, paid for by taxpayers. He lives off politics and he spends all his time sneering at politics. "We know that politics is not perfect, but at the end of the day it is the way that we decide how you pay your taxes, how we support our hospitals, our schools, whether we are going to war or not, how we deal with climate change." He continued: "Of course it's sometimes unedifying but this idea that you can sneer at the whole thing, dismiss everybody as somehow being rogues and charlatans and say, 'Well, therefore I'm going to wash my hands of the whole thing,' I think is a total abdication of responsibility. "I just have this old-fashioned view, if you want to improve something get stuck in and get your hands dirty and change it. "Don't somehow pretend you can turn your back on it." In the Newsnight interview with Paxman, Brand argued he had never voted because of "absolute indifference and weariness and exhaustion from the lies, treachery and deceit of the political class". At the time, Paxman responded by asking: "If you can't be arsed to vote, why should we be arsed to listen to your political point of view?" But Paxman later told the Radio Times he had some sympathy with Brand's position. "I can understand that: the whole green-bench pantomime in Westminster looks a remote and self-important echo chamber. But it is all we have," he said. On his decision not to vote, he said: "By the time the polls had closed and it was too late to take part, I was feeling really uncomfortable: the person who chooses not to vote - cannot even be bothered to write 'none of the above' on a ballot paper - disqualifies himself from passing any comment at all." On BBC Radio 4's PM, comedian Ken Dodd was asked what he thought of Brand's stance, replying: "It's stupid. To be able to vote is a great privilege. "It's a privilege granted to every citizen, and we are citizens of the greatest country in the world and therefore we must preserve that." </body>

      <title>Theatre cuts 'equal to five jobs'</title>
      <description>Nottingham Playhouse bosses ask the county council to reconsider cuts that are "equivalent to five jobs".</description>

      <body>Nottingham Playhouse bosses have asked the county council to reconsider a proposed £94,000 reduction in funding. The theatre's chief executive Stephanie Sirr said the cuts are "the equivalent of around five jobs". The county council has proposed the deduction to help cope with its £154m budget deficit and government cuts over the next three years. The authority said it has tried to provide fairness but its priority is the vulnerable, young and the elderly. Ms Sirr said: "£94,000 pounds doesn't actually buy very many services, it doesn't make a huge difference to the county council but it makes a massive difference to Nottingham Playhouse. "It's the equivalent of around five jobs so we are asking them to reconsider and asking people to contact the county council." The Labour-led authority announced that 800 jobs could go and services would be cut over the next three years, due to the government's austerity programme. Councillor Joyce Bosnjak, deputy leader of Nottinghamshire County Council, said: "Inevitably, when deciding which services we can continue to deliver, this means we are faced with extremely stark choices. "We have to try to provide fairness in a difficult time and our priorities will be those in greatest need - the vulnerable young and older people. "We recognise that Nottingham Playhouse makes a valuable contribution to the area's economy and arts development. "However, it is located in the city of Nottingham, which is not under the jurisdiction of the county council. "None of the theatres which do fall into the county council's area receive any grant support from the council." Screenwriter William Ivory said he felt "ashamed" to come from Nottinghamshire, following the council's announcement. Mr Ivory, who has based much of his work in Nottinghamshire, including BBC One dramas Truckers and A Thing Called Love, tweeted: "For 20 years I've tried to show Notts off to the world: an artistic heartland to come film in. Maybe not. #costofeverythingvalueofnothing." </body>

      <title>Director Ramsay sued by producers</title>
      <description>The producers of a Western, starring Natalie Portman, take legal action against Scots director Lynne Ramsay, who quit the movie before filming began.</description>

      <body>The producers of Jane Got A Gun, a Western starring Natalie Portman, have taken legal action against Scots director Lynne Ramsay, who quit the movie a day before shooting. They said Ramsay was paid $750,000 (£466,000) to work on the screenplay and to direct but her last-minute departure delayed production. They also claimed she was drunk and abusive on set. Ramsay was followed off the troubled project by actor Michael Fassbender. Jude Law, who was brought in as a replacement, followed suit as did Bradley Cooper after him. Ewan McGregor was eventually brought in to star with Oscar-winner Portman, with Warrior filmmaker Gavin O'Connor signed on to direct. According to the film's synopsis, Portman plays the wife of an injured outlaw, who is forced to defend her farm from his former gang after they attempt to murder him. The court papers, acquired by the Hollywood Reporter and filed in a federal court in New Mexico - where the film was due to shoot, alleged Ramsay "was repeatedly under the influence of alcohol, was abusive to members of the cast and crew and was generally disruptive". The legal action further alleged that Ramsey, who was Bafta-nominated for We Need To Talk About Kevin - starring Tilda Swinton, endangered crew members "when she pointed a prop gun directly at a camera and, in turn, at the camera crew before first taking proper precautions". Portman - who is also one of the film's producers - reportedly showed up for the first day of shooting in March unaware that Ramsay had quit the day before. According to a report in the Hollywood Reporter, the Scottish filmmaker had not been presented with an approved schedule, script or budget days before shooting was set to begin. Earlier this year, Ramsay served on the prize jury at the Cannes Film Festival alongside Stephen Spielberg and Nicole Kidman. </body>

      <body>The debut novel from folk singer Woody Guthrie is up for 2013's Literary Review Bad Sex in Fiction Award, 46 years after his death. Guthrie's House of Earth will battle novels including Susan Choi's My Education and Rupert Thomson's Secrecy. The winner will be revealed during a ceremony in London on 3 December. Judges revealed they "agonised" over a passage from Helen Fielding's new Bridget Jones: Mad about The Boy, but felt it did not make the cut. An encounter between the famous singleton and an ex-army officer - "'Oh, oh,' I gasped. 'Did they teach you this in the SAS?'" - was deemed "not quite cringeworthy enough". The full list of nominees features The Last Banquet by Jonathan Grimwood, Motherland by William Nicholson, Manil Suri's The City of Devi, The Victoria System by Eric Reinhardt and The World Was All Before Them by Matthew Reynolds. Now in its 21st year, the award is to recognise the "most egregious passage of sexual description" in a novel. Phrases such as "her body melted into a single note of music to the sky" have earned American singer Guthrie his posthumous nomination. His newly-discovered novel was released earlier this year and featured an introduction from Johnny Depp. Meanwhile Rupert Thompson's Secrecy - set in 17th-Century Italy - includes this passage: "Mauve and yellow flowers filled the blank screen of my eyelids, the petals loosening and drifting downwards on to smooth grey stone. I kissed the soft bristles in the hollow of her armpit." Last year the prize was won by Canadian author Nancy Huston for her book Infrared. The literary magazine Literary Review said its purpose was "to draw attention to the crude, badly written, often perfunctory use of redundant passages of sexual description in the modern novel, and to discourage it." </body>

      <title>Taiwan singer's flag display sparks row</title>

      <body>Taiwanese singer Deserts Chang could never have imagined that her small concert in Manchester last week would trigger a massive row on Chinese social media over cross-strait relations. At the concert held on Saturday at the University of Manchester, attended mainly by students from Taiwan and mainland China, Chang took a Taiwanese flag from a group of fans in the front row and unfurled it on stage. "I see there are also people who bring a national flag to the concert," the 32-year-old singer-songwriter said, adding "I have not felt so patriotic for a while... and I am from Taiwan." Chang was soon interrupted by a female Chinese student, who shouted in English: "There are students from mainland here. No politics today!" To which Chang replied, "It's not politics, it is just a flag that represents where I am from." It was a minor argument involving two people, and other Chinese students at the concert did not get involved. But when the incident was disclosed on the internet, it attracted massive interest and on Tuesday became one of the top trending topics on Sina Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter. Many online commentators accused Chang of openly declaring Taiwan's independence and being arrogant towards Chinese students in the audience. Some even told the singer to stay away from mainland China and leave the entertainment industry. "Please never come to the mainland and never release albums here," wrote Weibo user "Shen Xiaotang". China and Taiwan split in 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party overthrew the Republic of China (ROC) and founded the People's Republic on the mainland, forcing the ROC government to retreat to Taiwan. Many mainland Chinese support Beijing's claim that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and therefore find Chang's display of the Taiwanese flag unacceptable. But not all Chinese netizens share this sentiment. In fact, many have come to Chang's defence and have criticised her critics for over-reacting. "Some people have over-reacted again. Their sensitive nerves can only expose their fragility and sense of inferiority," said "April Zi". To some netizens, it is absurd to accuse Chang of being a separatist due to this incident, because the flag she showed at the concert used to be the national flag of China before 1949 and is not a symbol of Taiwan's pro-independence forces. Weibo user "Old Q" said: "Those who accuse Chang of supporting Taiwan independence have been brainwashed. You can afford to be ignorant, but you cannot afford to lack such basic common sense." As the online debate raged on, rumours began to circulate that Chang's career in China was in danger. According to major Chinese and Hong Kong entertainment media outlets, which have given extensive coverage to the incident, Chang's 30 December Beijing concert could be cancelled by the Chinese authorities. The Taiwanese government weighed in on Wednesday to try to minimise the damage to cross-strait relations. Wang Yu-chi, the head of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, said Chang had not done anything wrong and that he would be "pained" if her Beijing concert is cancelled simply because of the flag row. When asked about her take on the incident, a Chinese spokeswoman on cross-strait relations avoided discussing the possible cancellation of the concert. Talking to Taiwanese media, Fan Liqing, spokeswoman for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, simply said that Beijing hopes people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait could "enhance mutual understanding" and "work together for a Chinese renaissance".

      <body>Some of the BBC's biggest freelance stars could be asked to join the payroll or leave the corporation, as a new test aims to clear up tax issues. It is part of a clampdown on the use of personal service companies (PSCs) and a move to tax more freelancers at source. The new employment test will be applied to BBC talent from next week, as and when contracts come up for renewal. News presenters Jeremy Paxman and Fiona Bruce are among the stars currently paid through their own companies. The test will involve the BBC assessing how much editorial control it has over an individual's activities. Anyone for whom this is a "significant" amount will be asked to join the payroll, instead of being paid through a PSC. The BBC has said it will assess people on a case by case basis, so it is not possible to say how many presenters will be affected. For those with a more casual relationship, who only appear on-air short-term or who make and deliver programmes, it is likely they will still be classified as self-employed. The changes are the result of a tax review by accountants Deloitte and BBC auditors last year, which found that 800 on-air staff were being paid through their own companies. It was commissioned after a Public Accounts Committee report said too many staff, in the government and the BBC, made their own arrangements to pay tax and national insurance, which could allow them to contribute less. However, the review, published in November 2012, found "no evidence" that the BBC used personal service companies to help aid tax avoidance. Off-air talent is already being tested, with the BBC estimating around 20 per cent of its 16,000 production freelancers may be asked to become BBC employees. </body>

      <body>Don Johnson will lead the cast of a television series based on Robert Rodriguez's cult 1996 film From Dusk Till Dawn, starring Quentin Tarantino. Johnson, best known for his role in '80s TV hit Miami Vice, takes a recurring role as Sheriff Earl McGraw. Rodriguez, an executive producer on the series, will direct the first two episodes of the 10-episode drama. "If the movie's the short story, the series is the novel," says Rodriguez. The series will premiere next spring. "We have assembled an amazing cast and crew, and viewers can expect to be part of a wild ride when the series premieres on El Rey Network," added Rodriguez. El Rey Network is a 24-hour, English-language network founded by Rodriguez. It will feature original dramas, feature films, horror, sci-fi and "next-generation sports". The new network will debut in the US in December. Vampires DJ Cotrona and Zane Holtz will star in the forthcoming Dusk Till Dawn TV series as criminals Seth and Richie Gecko, previously portrayed on the big screen by George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino, respectively. The series sees the Gecko brothers escaping to Mexico after a bank heist which leaves several people dead. The pair take hostage a former minister - played by Harvey Keitel in the film - and his family, using their mobile home to travel to the Mexican border. But it is their stopover at a notorious nightclub populated by vampires that gave the film its cult following - and brought Salma Hayek to global attention as stripper Satanico Pandemonium. Miramax will be distributing the series outside the US, though not in the UK. No British channel has yet picked up the series. </body>

      <body>A Broadway stage adaptation of A Time To Kill by John Grisham is to close after less than two months, producers have announced. The play was based on the US thriller writer's 1989 book, which was turned into a 1986 film which earned Samuel L Jackson a Golden Globe nomination. Weekly takings never topped $300,000, and last week saw houses filled to an average of 55% capacity. The curtain is set to close on the show on 17 November. The legal drama told the tale of a black father in the deep south who takes the law into his own hands when two white racists rape his daughter, and the young lawyer who takes on his case. The film co-starred Sandra Bullock, with Matthew McConaughey in his first starring role as lawyer Jake Brigance - winning him an MTV breakthrough award It was also nominated for a Razzie for the worst written film grossing over $100m. The stage show received mixed reviews with Variety noting "a distinctly dated feeling to the material — not the topic of Southern racism, but the youthful idealism of its hero". However, USA Today said it was "more sharply focused than the 1996 film adaptation of the novel, and does a better job of incorporating folksy humour into the disturbing and at times pedantic story". Speaking at the time of the show's launch, Grisham said: "It was my first book and the first that I have allowed to be adapted for the theatre. "I am happy that not only my loyal readers, but a whole new audience will be able to experience this story in live theatre." Grisham published Sycamore Row, his long-awaited sequel to A Time to Kill, just two days after the Broadway production's opening night. </body>

      <body>A woman has baked an "almost life-sized" Johnny Depp cake for a competition. Lara Clarke, an amateur baker from Brownhills, West Midlands, made the Pirates of the Caribbean-inspired creation for the Cake International competition in Birmingham. She said: "The judges are probably more used to seeing three-tier wedding cakes than giant Jack Sparrows." A competition spokesperson said entrants' creativity was "surprising". Ms Clarke, who is entering the 5ft 5in (1.65m) cake in the large decorative exhibit section of the competition, said she had only started baking two years ago. "All I'd really made before was some bog-standard banana cake in home economics," she said. "The first time I baked a decorated cake was for my mother-in-law's 25th wedding anniversary. I thought it was rubbish but everybody else seemed to like it." Since then, Ms Clarke has baked cakes for family and friends. Previous efforts have included a 4ft (1.2m) Grinch cake, a motorbike and a cake replica of her mother-in-law. Ms Clarke, who works for a bingo website, said she learned her skills from watching YouTube videos. The Johnny Depp cake is the first time she has attempted anything on such a large scale. "One of my friends was on the phone and said I should enter Cake International," she said. "At the time I was watching Pirates of the Caribbean. I was watching Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp, and I thought he would make the perfect cake. "He wears all these different fabrics, so he has lots of different textures to him. "He's just shy of life-size because I was worried we wouldn't be able to get him out of the door. "It took me 90 hours to make. We live with my fiancé's parents and I think they will be pleased to get rid of it. "When my father-in-law first saw him, he leapt about 10ft in the air thinking we had burglars." Ms Clarke has hired a minibus to take Johnny to the competition on Friday. The results will be known on Sunday. She said: "The competition is like the Crufts of the baking world. People like Mary Berry will be there." A spokesperson for Cake International said: "There really is no limit to the talent and ingenuity of the competitors." </body>

      <body>Drinking glasses that were a gift from Hollywood legend Humphrey Bogart have sold for more than double their expected price. Bogart gave public relations man Bill Rowland Hill the six small and five large glasses for his help publicising the 1951 film The African Queen. They were sold for £8,000 to a private buyer from Europe at an art and antiques fair in London. It had been expected that they would sell for about £3,500. The glasses, which were engraved with the initials HB, were accompanied by a letter on 20th Century Fox-headed notepaper from Pinewood signed "Bogie". He thanks Mr Rowland Hill for his PR work and "all the other little things". The letter reads: "My Dear Bill. Before I leave for home I want to say, one big 'thank you' from the bottom of my heart for all you have done publicity wise both on the set, and in Africa. "I wanted to send you some Hootch but on second thoughts I want you to have something to put it in. "Will you call at that fancy store (Heal's) on Tottenham Court Street and see a guy called Gaylard. Choose yourself a dozen glasses from the suite I have had made. "Once again sport, thanks a million." Huston's World War 1 film, The African Queen, tells the story of American Rose Sayer - played by Katharine Hepburn - who escapes a village burned down in German East Africa on a boat owned by rough-and-ready Charlie Allnutt, played by Bogart. It won Bogart the best actor Oscar in 1952. The 11 glasses were being sold by antique glass dealers Mark J West, of Redhill, Surrey, at the 23rd Winter Fine Art and Antiques Fair at London Olympia. </body>

      <title>Giacometti leads impressionist sale</title>
      <description>An auction of impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's in New York has fetched more than $290 million.</description>

      <body>An auction of impressionist and modern art at Sotheby's in New York raised more than $290m (£180m). Sales were led by a Giacometti sculpture and a Picasso oil painting, which fetched $50m (£31m) and $39.9m (£24.8m) respectively. Sotheby's claimed sales were driven by the fact that many of the 64 lots had never been auctioned before. "I wasn't anticipating how many bidders would be chasing the top lots," Sotheby's David Norman told Reuters. The sale followed a pair of lacklustre auctions at rival auctioneers Christie's earlier this week, when most of the top lots went unsold and totals fell far below even low pre-sale estimates. "I was concerned that the market was feeling nervous and cautious," said Mr Norman, Sotheby's co-chairman of impressionist and modern art worldwide. But the market appears to have been buoyed, once again, by investors from Latin America and Asia. "We've just seen an explosive growth," said Mr Norman. "This is a very sophisticated group of buyers. They enter the market at the highest level... It's really quite extraordinary," he added. Alberto Giacometti's bronze bust, of his brother Diego, is considered one of his best works, while Picasso's 1935 portrait of his pregnant mistress, Tete de Femme, easily beat its pre-sale estimate of $20-$30m. Picasso's 1969 Mousquetaire a la Pipe set a new auction record for a late work by the artist, fetching just shy of $31m - about 50 per cent more than its estimate. The auctions continue next week when Christie's and Sotheby's hold their sales of post-war and contemporary art. </body>

      <title>Nazi hoard: Allies 'returned items'</title>

      <body>Some of the works of Nazi-looted art presented in Munich on Tuesday were confiscated by the Allies after World War Two, and later returned to an art dealer, say German media reports. Suddeutsche Zeitung says Hildebrand Gurlitt successfully lobbied the Allies for the return of more than 100 works. Some of the items were among more than 1,400 art works found in the apartment of Gurlitt's son, Cornelius, it says. The hoard's total value is estimated at about 1bn euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Meanwhile, the German government says it now favours publishing some details about the art works; Jewish groups and others had said there should be immediate full disclosure of what is in the collection. The Suddeutsche Zeitung newspaper says it based its findings on the transcripts of interviews conducted by the Allies with the art dealer, Hildebrand Gurlitt. The newspaper says a list attached to one of the transcripts provides information about more than 100 pieces in what Hildebrand Gurlitt claimed to be his private collection. According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung report, Hildebrand Gurlitt lobbied the Allies for the return of this collection, which had been confiscated in 1945, and at the time was stored at a United States depot in Wiesbaden, in south-west Germany. The Allies returned this private collection - excluding two pieces - in 1950, says the report. The list of items given back to Hildebrand Gurlitt is reported to include some of the works of art presented by German officials on Tuesday, including a painting by Marc Chagall and a self-portrait by Otto Dix. Prosecutors say 121 framed and 1,285 unframed works were seized in Munich in March 2012 in the flat of Cornelius Gurlitt, who was being investigated for tax evasion. They included previously unregistered works by Max Liebermann and Henri Matisse; there were also works by Pablo Picasso, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Canaletto. The issue of ownership is still being clarified. Investigators have so far released very few details about the 1,400 works, saying that they are still continuing their investigations, and that people should come forward with inquiries. But Jewish groups are among those that have called for the works to be made public immediately, so that the families of Holocaust victims can identify and recover art that was taken from them. A German government spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters on Wednesday that "the government is in favour of publishing information about those artworks where there are already indications that they may have been confiscated from people persecuted by the Nazis". </body>

      <body>The artistic director of Russia's Bolshoi ballet has described having acid thrown in his face during the trial of a dancer accused of ordering the attack. Sergei Filin, who suffered severe burns to his face and damage to his sight, spoke of a "terrifying pain". Pavel Dmitrichenko has denied arranging the assault in a case that revealed bitter infighting at the Bolshoi. Two other men are being tried with him over the attack in January. Mr Filin, 43, began his testimony on Wednesday by saying he was fair and transparent in distributing roles. But he said that Mr Dmitrichenko, 29, kept trying to find compromising material on him. He described the night of the assault, and how his attacker said "Here's a greeting for you" as he threw sulphuric acid in his face. "Suddenly I felt liquid, I felt a sudden pain, I had never experienced such pain," he said. "Terrifying pain, my eyes couldn't see." Mr Filin's highly anticipated court appearance came despite doctors' orders for him to avoid stress, according to AFP news agency. Prosecutors say Mr Dmitrichenko colluded with ex-convict Yuri Zarutsky, who has admitted throwing the acid at the ballet chief outside his home. Mr Zarutsky insists he acted alone. A third defendant, Andrei Lipatov, who is accused of driving the car used to transport the alleged attacker, has denied any part in the attack. If convicted, the three accused could be sentenced to up to 12 years in prison. Mr Dmitrichenko has been in custody since his arrest in March. Meanwhile, Mr Filin has undergone more than 20 operations on his eyes since the attack. Doctors in Germany have managed to partially restore his sight, but he will reportedly need further treatment. He was once star of Russia's renowned Bolshoi theatre, and in 2011 became the artistic director of the ballet troupe. The acid attack exposed vicious internal rivalries which eventually caused the dismissal of Bolshoi director Anatoly Iksanov. </body>

      <title>Star Wars movie to hold open casting</title>
      <description>Unprecedented open casting sessions are to be held for Star Wars: Episode VII around the UK and Ireland in November, the BBC has learned.</description>

      <body>Open auditions are being planned for two lead roles in the next Star Wars film, the BBC has learned. The casting sessions for Star Wars: Episode VII will start later this week at locations around the UK and Ireland, including London, Dublin and Glasgow. According to a casting notice the film-makers are looking to fill two roles. They are a "street smart and strong" orphaned girl in her late teens and a "smart capable" man in his late teens or early 20s. The open auditions for a "major Hollywood Movie" were first published on the twitter account @UKopencall, which announced a "nationwide search for lead roles for a Disney movie". Disney bought Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars series, in October 2012. In the US open auditions also begin this week according to an online notice. Casting directors will be visiting cities including Nashville and Chicago as well as accepting online applications. Lucasfilm declined to comment to the BBC but it is likely the characters have been given non sci-fi names and descriptions in the announcement in an effort to disguise the auditions are for Star Wars: Episode VII. The broad nature of the characters is almost the same as in descriptions leaked online earlier in the year when the overall casting process began. While it is unprecedented for lead parts in a franchise of this size to hold open auditions in this way, Star Wars has in the past given major roles to little known actors and actresses through the traditional casting process, dating back to the original trilogy when the then unknown Mark Hamill won the role of Luke Skywalker. Other movies have successfully cast secondary actors and actresses through open auditions in the past most notably some of the later Harry Potter films. And actress Dakota Blue Richards won the lead role of Lyra in The Golden Compass, the film adaptation of Philip Pullman's Northern Lights, through open casting. Director JJ Abrams, who is also co-scripting the movie, will not be attending the open auditions which begin in Bristol on 9 November. Instead those at the auditions, who must be over the age of 16 for the female role, and over 18 for the male role, will briefly meet members of the casting team of the film. Star Wars: Episode VII is scheduled to begin shooting at Pinewood Studios in spring 2014, for an expected 2015 release. </body>

      <body>Tom Cruise has dismissed claims he has "abandoned" his seven-year-old daughter Suri following his divorce from actress Katie Holmes as "patently false". "I have in no way cut Suri out of my life," he said in a declaration filed on Tuesday in a $50m (£31m) defamation case against magazine publisher Bauer. The 51-year-old is suing Bauer over two 2012 tabloid stories that claimed he was absent from his daughter's life. Cruise and Holmes divorced in June last year after six years of marriage. The legal action relates to stories in Life and Style and In Touch magazines that claimed overseas film shoots had stopped the actor being a constant presence in Suri's life. In documents made public by Radar Online, the star acknowledged he was "a professional actor in motion pictures" whose job involved "extended periods of time in various parts of the world". However, Cruise insisted he and his daughter remained "extremely close" and had a "wonderful relationship and cheerful phone calls". "While I'm sure my daughter misses me when I am not with her (as I miss her), she is a very happy child," the actor's statement read. Suri, he continued, "has never indicated, in words or substance, that she has ever felt abandoned by me". Cruise's lawyers are asking a judge to order Bauer to declare it did not have any sources to support its contentions. Bauer's lawyers have argued the star's motion should be rejected, referring to statements from confidential sources that allegedly support its claims. </body>

      <title>Korean festival brings hits to London</title>
      <description>The eighth London Korean Film Festival opens this week, offering UK audiences the chance to see a number of titles that have enjoyed unexpected box office success in their home country.</description>

      <body>The eighth London Korean Film Festival opens this week, offering UK audiences the chance to see a number of titles that have enjoyed unexpected box office success in their home country. They include festival opener Hide and Seek, a low-budget home invasion thriller that reached five million ticket sales in less than three weeks, despite having no established stars. Also on the line-up is The Flu, a disaster movie about an influenza epidemic that had a similarly strong reaction in South Korea last August. Secretly, Greatly - a comedy about North Korean spies stationed in the South that enjoyed the biggest opening weekend for a domestic release last June - is another crowd-pleaser to feature in the programme. The event will also screen Wish, whose dramatisation of a real-life child abuse case that became a cause celebre in South Korea saw it top the country's box office chart last month. The resurgence of home-grown product has not gone unnoticed, with Variety's Patrick Frater remarking this week that "things are looking up for Korean cinema". "This year has seen a succession of local stories that emerged from indie roots... films made by first or second-time directors... and pic[ture]s that became hits without recognisable stars," the journal's Asia correspondent said. Earlier this year, Screen Daily reported South Korea's box office hit a record high in the first half of 2013 with 98.5 million admissions. More than half of these admissions were for local films, a factor that led Variety to suggest Korean cinema was "on the cusp of a new golden era". Its prediction appears to be borne out by Snowpiercer, an ambitious sci-fi epic whose $40m (£24.8m) budget makes it the most expensive South Korean release ever. The English-language film, whose international cast includes Chris Evans, Tilda Swinton and John Hurt, has made almost $60m (£37m) in South Korea since opening in August according to Box Office Mojo. It has since opened in France on 300 screens - the widest release ever in that country for a Korean film. Where the film goes from there remains a moot point, though, amid reports the film is to be substantially cut before distribution worldwide. The launch of this year's London Korean Film Festival conveniently coincides with a state visit by Park Geun-hye, South Korea's first female president. The president's visit will include a special preview of Hide and Seek, to take place in London later ahead of the festival's official launch on Thursday. The South Korean leader was in Paris earlier this week and made a point of highlighting Snowpiercer as an example of cultural collaboration between her country and Europe. "It is my hope that such similar collaborations can take place in terms of cultural content and technology, and furthermore contribute to cooperative relations," she said on Monday. Her attendance later will bring an additional charge to an event that has some experience when it comes to attracting high-profile guests. Last year's closing night gala, for example, saw Bruce Willis, John Malkovich and Dame Helen Mirren come out in support for Korean actor Lee Byung-hun, with whom they were shooting action sequel Red 2 at the time. Following this year's events in London, the 2013 Korean Film Festival - which features no films from North Korea - will present highlights from its programme in Oxford, Bradford and St Andrews. It will, however, have to compete for audiences with other specialised showcases of international cinema that are running concurrently. The capital is also playing host to the UK Jewish Film Festival, which is holding events in London, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow until 17 November. This week also sees the launch of the 21st UK French Film Festival, which will bring a selection of Gallic offerings to London, Warwick and eight locations in Scotland until 7 December. </body>

      <title>Taylor Swift honoured at CMA Awards</title>
      <description>The Country Music Association presents its Pinnacle Award to Taylor Swift, as George Strait is named entertainer of the year.</description>

      <body>The Country Music Association has handed Taylor Swift its Pinnacle Award - a prize only awarded once before to Country legend Garth Brooks in 2005. It recognises artists who take the genre to a worldwide audience, and comes despite Swift's recent shift towards more mainstream pop. George Strait, 61, won entertainer of the year at the ceremony in Nashville. Blake Shelton and wife Miranda Lambert were named best male and best female vocalists, each for the fourth time. Shelton, who has been a judge on the US version of The Voice since 2011, also won album of the year for Based on a True Story. Swift, 23, who was nominated in six categories, was surprised on stage by six country stars that she had opened for as a teenager. Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Keith Urban, George Strait, Brad Paisley and the members of Rascal Flatts all joined her, before a video featuring messages from stars including Justin Timberlake, Julia Roberts, Carly Simon and Mick Jagger. "I didn't know there was going to be all this. You've made me feel so special right now," said Swift, who also performed an acoustic version of her hit Red, accompanied by Vince Gill, Alison Krauss and Sam Bush. However, her Pinnacle Award attracted some criticism, including in the New York Times. "The only way for country music to respond to [Swift] - and for her to engage with country music, a dance partner she only sometimes favours - is to fete her endlessly, to let her be both serious in addition to frilly, to weave her even more tightly into the fabric of Nashville," wrote Jon Caramanica. He added: "She is country music's cash cow, its creative engine, its ambassador to the wider world." Despite having won a total of 17 CMA awards over the years, Strait shared his surprise at taking the entertainer of the year prize for the third time in his career. "This blows me away, I cannot believe it. This means the world to me," he said, after beating the likes of Swift and Shelton to the prize. Strait is currently on his Cowboy Rides Away farewell tour after announcing his retirement from touring, but has said he intends to continue recording with occasional live appearances. Florida Georgia Line won single of the year for their crossover hit Cruise, and best duo of the year. New star Kacey Musgraves, who had six nominations following her debut Same Trailer Different Park, went home with best new artist. "This first year has been just indescribable. It's amazing what 52 weeks can do to a person," said Musgraves. "Last year I had really crappy seats. I was just sitting back with my roommate just as a fan. And here I am holding this thing.'' The three-hour ceremony - shown live on ABC in the US - was hosted by Carrie Underwood and Brad Paisley for the sixth year running. Kenny Rogers was given a lifetime achievement award, telling fans "It's been a hell of a month." He continued: "The (Country Music) Hall of Fame last week, this this week. I can't wait to see what's coming next week.'' </body>

      <body>Many parents fear music videos have become too sexualised and violent, the founder of a parenting website has said. Siobhan Freegard, of Netmums, said parents were not prudes, but felt things had "gone too far". In a survey of some 1,500 website members, most (82%) said their children had repeated sexual lyrics without knowing their meaning. And three-quarters said they tried to stop children watching music videos. Ms Freegard said parents were most angry that their children were being exposed to "lewd viewing" on programmes shown before the 21:00 watershed for family viewing. "Modern parents aren't prudes - they know sex sells," she said. "But there's a strong feeling that things have gone too far now. It's toxic to tell young kids casual sex and violence are something to aspire to." Most (75%) of parents with daughters said very sexual pop acts were teaching girls they would be "judged on their looks, not their achievements or personality". About half of parents with sons said they were frightened explicit footage made them believe women were "too sexually available" and that they should have "unrealistic porn-star-style body shapes". About 1,500 members of the website opted to take part in the online survey last month, shortly after an outcry over the latest music video and performances by Miley Cyrus. The Irish singer Sinead O'Connor recently warned the former children's TV star not to let herself be exploited by the music business, sparking a row between the pair. Two-thirds of parents taking part said they thought young female singers were being exploited. Defending a recent controversial performance, Miley Cyrus said people were "over-thinking" what she had done and that she had been trying to "make history". </body>

      <title>BBC rapped over Dan Snow documentary</title>

      <body>The BBC Trust has upheld a complaint against Dan Snow's History of Syria, in which the presenter implied that Israel had started the Six Day War. The complainant said Snow's statement that: 'In 1967, Assad was Minister of Defence when Israel launched a series of strikes against Egypt, Jordan and Syria...' "vilified" Israel. The trust found that "more context was required" in the BBC Two documentary. It concluded it was "not duly accurate" to describe the events as Snow did. Addressing his initial complaint to the BBC, the complainant said "it was unsurprising that Israel was vilified when a BBC presenter could imply that the Jewish state started the 1967 war". The BBC responded saying that there had been no implication as to who had been the aggressor, merely that the attacks were launched by Israel and that this was accurate. The complainant took his complaint to the Editorial Complaints Unit, but it was not upheld "as it found that the language used in the broadcast was not materially inaccurate or in breach of the Editorial Guidelines". Appealing to the BBC Trust, the complainant said the wording in the one-hour documentary could have been changed to better reflect the situation at the time and the various events leading up to the outbreak of war, emphasising that Israel acted in self-defence in response to a military attack by Jordan. The trust said it was clear that the programme's focus was Syria and the history which lies behind the present conflict. It noted the earlier defence by the documentary's executive producer in which he said: "The 'offending' line - about Israel launching a series of airstrikes in 1967 - is not inaccurate." "It is bald, admittedly, but given the Syrian context of the film, I don't think it is reasonable to think that we should have created the space to place the line within a broader Israeli context. "The focus was Syria... to have spent more time on the background/context from an Israeli perspective would I think have been distracting or, worse still, confusing." However, the trust found that the events of the Six-Day War were of such significance in the history and politics of the Middle East, that, "despite the brevity of the reference, more context was required". It found "the need to use clear and precise language was particularly acute in relation to content dealing with conflict in the Middle East". The trust praised "an otherwise informative and nuanced programme" but concluded "particularly given the evidence that Jordan launched attacks on Israel before Israel's forces were engaged, it was not duly accurate to describe the events on 5 June 1967 in the way this programme did". The committee decided the programme breached the Editorial Guidelines on accuracy. </body>

      <body>BBC Worldwide "made mistakes" in the purchase of the Lonely Planet travel guide, which it sold in 2013 at a loss of £80m, a new report has found. The BBC Trust said forecasts on which the £132m deal was based were "too aggressive" and its estimated earnings before tax were "highly optimistic". The commercial arm of the BBC sold Lonely Planet to NC2 Media for £50m. The BBC needed more "clarity" and "accountability" for future investments, the report findings said. BBC Worldwide acquired a 75 per cent stake in the guide in 2007 and completed the purchase four years later. BBC Worldwide, said the report, "seemed to get carried away with the deal" and there should have been "an effective mechanism" in place to ensure that it did not end up over-paying. It added that not enough analysis was done on the potential downturn in the book market and into whether or not "optimistic" online forecasts could be achieved. The BBC was criticised for the length of time it took to migrate the guide's website to London, with the report adding: "The task... of migrating Lonely Planet's business on to other platforms, especially online and TV, was substantially under-estimated". It added that a negative public reaction to the deal "should have been better anticipated and appropriate measures put in place to deal with it". In 2009, a Culture Media and Sport Select Committee said the purchase expanded an area "where the BBC has no, or very limited existing interests". In 2010, a BBC Trust report said the "scale and nature of the Lonely Planet acquisition" would not be considered again. BBC vice chairman Diane Coyle said: "The important thing now is that the lessons highlighted by this review are implemented, alongside broader improvements to the strategy and oversight of the BBC's commercial operations. "It is important to view the significant financial loss from Lonely Planet against the backdrop of a sustained strong performance from BBC Worldwide as a whole, which brings significant benefits to licence fee payers." </body>

      <title>Greek police clear broadcaster's HQ</title>
      <description>Greek riot police clear the headquarters of former state broadcaster ERT, evacuating the building and arresting several people.</description>

      <body>Greek riot police have cleared the headquarters of the former state broadcaster ERT, using tear gas to gain entry and arresting several people. Police formed a cordon round the building in Athens, before going from room to room to evacuate protesters. Former employees have occupied the building since the government closed ERT and sacked its 2,600 staff in June. Greece's conservative-led coalition said the state broadcaster cost too much to run in an economic crisis. The closure of ERT prompted a left-wing party to withdraw from the governing coalition of prime minister Antonis Samaras in protest - a move which almost brought down the government. The BBC's Mark Lowen, in Athens, says the question is whether the ERT debacle again fuels social unrest here - and how much stomach the Greeks still have for a fight. Following the announcement of ERT's closure in June, hundreds of staff refused to leave the building and continued to broadcast their programming via the internet. But early on Thursday, Greek police arrived to secure the building in Agia Paraskevi, a suburb in the north of Athens. Riot police used tear gas to disperse about 200 protesters outside the building, and then cleared each room inside. One ERT journalist, Nikos Kourovilos, told the BBC by phone he had managed to evade police and was still inside. "They are in the building, they have control, they put everyone out. The good thing is they forgot about me, because I told them I had to take my stuff and I will go," he said. He said he was hoping to be able to make a broadcast later "because it's for democracy". "We feel like we are Robin Hood… We are the voice of the people," he said. Another member of staff told the BBC that once officers entered, it was fairly peaceful. Twenty or so workers were led out but three refused to go and were arrested. The state-run Athens News Agency reported that Panagiotis Kalfagiannis, a journalist and head of the ERT employees' union, Pospert, was one of those held for public order offences. ERT was Greece's only TV broadcaster until the advent of private TV channels in 1989. Despite several major overhauls to keep up with fierce private competition, a fall in ERT's ratings in the mid-1990s triggered a long-running debate about its cost and efficiency. In June, as Greece attempted to satisfy international creditors that it was fulfilling its debt restructuring and bailout commitments, the prime minister, Antonis Samaras, announced the closure of ERT. He said the Greek exchequer could no longer afford to pay for a public broadcaster that cost 300 million euros ($406m; £252m) annually, and has refused to reinstate ERT unless it accepts a complete restructuring. An interim TV station, called Public TV or DT, has been broadcasting in Greece since July while a restructured public broadcaster, called Nerit, is not expected to begin operating before 2014. On Wednesday authorities in Valencia, a heavily indebted region of Spain, announced that the regional public broadcaster RTVV was being closed down to save money for other services including health and education. Spanish unions have vowed to fight the closure. Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Ken Dodd: Don't call me eccentric</title>
      <description>Ken Dodd gets serious about life, love and laughter</description>

      <body>Ken Dodd is the last star comedian from the variety era. Now 86, he is still drawing crowds for his five-hour stage shows. Opening an exhibition about his career, he gets serious about life and laughter - and why he does not like being called eccentric. He is the king of the diddymen, the squire of Knotty Ash, the clown with the tickling stick and the owner of the most famous front teeth in the land. If the number of catchphrases is a mark of a comedian's success, Ken Dodd has done well, with such trademark sayings as "how tickled I am" and "by jove missus" and nonsense concoctions like "tattyfilarious" and "discomknockerated". At the Museum of Liverpool to launch an exhibition of photographs taken during his career, he fluffs up his hair for the cameras and wields a discomknockeratingly large tickling stick. This is his 60th year as a professional comedian - so has the eccentric image helped his career? "I'm not eccentric," he protests. "Not in the least." The funny thing is, he does not appear to be joking. In fact, he seems to take offence at the suggestion. Until now, the interview has been conducted with Dodd, eyes half-closed, recalling early BBC broadcasts from clubs and music halls in the 1950s. But now he is upright, looking me square in the eye. "I'm better dressed than you. You're wearing denim trousers. You look like an out-of-work plumber. "I'm not eccentric. Why am I eccentric?" There is the hair, the outfits, the tickling sticks, I suggest. "The hair bit - when I was a little boy I always wanted curly hair," he replies. "And part of it is a slight - only a very slight - rebellion. "I think all comedians are rebellious in various degrees. But I don't think I'm eccentric, no. Not in the least. I think I'm a very, very staid person. Very, very conservative." Not eccentric? Pull the other one, Doddy. He has cultivated the persona of the daffy professor of comedy since making his professional stage debut in 1954, inspired by the entertainers he saw while growing up in Liverpool. When Dodd was just seven or eight, his parents would take him and his brother and sister on weekly trips to variety theatres in the city. "Slowly this curtain would go up and you'd be transported into a magical world," he recalls. "Everything was rosy glow. Everything looked wonderful, happy. "This man came on - he'd wear a check suit with a red face and he'd shout at the audience. He would say things and everybody would fall about laughing. I thought, that's a good job, that's what I want to be." Today, his live sets are stuffed with affably absurd rapid-fire gags ("On Friday, there was a tap on the front door. That plumber's got a funny sense of humour"), plus slow-building anecdotes and sentimental songs, to which he adds humorous lyrics. At times, his humour is masterful and timeless. At others, it is musty and old-fashioned, often based on "oo-er-missus" innuendo or creaky stereotypes of 'her indoors' versus a useless husband. His crowds, largely made up of fans of a certain vintage, do not seem to mind, and the performances on his seemingly never-ending tour still regularly last five hours and more. "Comedians are jesters and jesters have a fools' licence," he says. "Political correctness doesn't apply to us. We are encouraged to say things that everybody would love to say but are scared stiff of saying. A jester is part-entertainer, part Mr Happy, part-anarchist." The star often speaks of how there are two Ken Dodds - the comedian and the real man. Asked what the private Ken Dodd does on his days off, he paints a picture of someone who is more serious than his on-stage image might suggest. "I can sum it up in one word - thinking," he replies. "As you go through life, you're given this wonderful brain to think with. Everybody wants to know the meaning of life. Where we've come from, where we're going to, what we do while we're here. Yeah, there's a lot of philosopher in every person's private life." Dodd also spends a lot of time researching the history and workings of humour. He used to visit a library in every town in which he performed, scouring books about comedy and comedians. "There are about 22 different rules for creating gags, comedy, jokes," he explains. He now has an extensive private library on the subject. At one point, Dodd mentions in passing how "the audience are my family". This is a reference to the fact that has never had children. He has also never married, although he has a long-term fiancee, Anne Jones, a singer, pianist and flautist who is the support act on his tour. The star says he was always ambivalent about having a family of his own, but has recently been reflecting on the subject while thinking about his own parents, who he describes as "the best mum and dad in the world". "I was driving the car about a year ago and suddenly the thought swept over me - by what right did I have to demand that two people, my mother and father, should take care of me, look after me, feed me, clothe me, nurse me when I'm ill? "We don't have any right to this. The more I think about this, this one word keeps popping up, a word that's much abused and maligned, but the word has been there for centuries - love. "There are all different kinds of love. Parents must love their children. I don't know. I suppose I would." In other words, he would have loved his children. He takes a rare pause for thought. "I love my dog. I love him very, very much," he goes on. "And all the dogs I've ever had, I've always loved them. So I must have the capacity to do it." The interview time is up and the real Ken Dodd retreats again. Eccentric? Yes. But there is more to him than meets the eye. The exhibition, titled By Jove! It's Ken Dodd!, features photographs by Stephen Shakeshaft and runs at the Museum of Liverpool until 21 April. </body>

      <title>Bombay Bicycle Club unveil new album</title>
      <description>Bombay Bicycle Club want to get fans dancing</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24805462</url>
      <date>1383896751</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70905000/jpg/_70905419_bbc-final-9343.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>If the old saying 'tidy house, tidy mind' holds true, then the mini studio-cum-'man cave' currently occupied by Bombay Bicycle Club frontman Jack Steadman is a worrying visual depiction of a chaotic mind. Luckily, that is completely at odds with the friendly, softly spoken bookish 20-something currently nibbling on a handful of olives. A large print of Max Ernst's 1921 surrealist painting Celebes dominates a smallish room with high ceilings - piled high on temporary shelves are albums and a pile of pillows that suggest that many evenings have turned into all-night recording sessions. Several acoustic guitars lean against the walls in varying states of decrepitude and a small portrait of Snoopy looks on. A mixing desk sits in front of the Ernst print, with speakers boasting petite jam jars on top, a copy of a vintage book on fishing sits on the coffee table. This little room of wonders in a non-descript office building in west London is where Steadman has been listening to the final mixes of songs from the band's forthcoming as-yet-untitled fourth studio album. In fact, the final mix of the album's closing track, the somewhat fitting So Long, See You Tomorrow has been sent to Steadman within the hour and he is itching to listen to it, which effectively means that this will be the first public play of the new material. It's all very exciting and actually a bit of privilege to be witness to a very small piece of history being made. The track is gorgeous, a long intro of descending minor chords before Steadman's airy falsetto waltzes in and out of a gentle melody. A false ending gives way to a full on, euphoric smack round the face ending. Steadman admits: "We wanted something that was a little bit like the Chemical Brothers". Just a few tracks have so far been released to the music press and admittedly without having heard much of the new album, it would be inappropriate to suggest it is the perfect finale. However, on the strength of a first listen, it sounds like a fitting ending to any album, particularly one that will be nearly three years in the waiting by the time it is released in early 2014. "We take a lot of time thinking about the album as a piece of art and how it should flow rather than just be happy with 10 good songs and not really care what order they go in," admits Steadman. "Its kind of like an added bonus for people who listen to the whole album," agrees bass player Ed Nash. Formed as The Canals in Crouch End in London in 2005 when they were teenagers, they eventually settled on Bombay Bicycle Club after a chain of Indian restaurants. Their debut album, I Had the Blues But I Shook Them Loose, was released in 2009, charting at number 46. Flaws, released in 2010, hit the top 10 with the acclaimed A Different Kind of Fix just missing the top five in 2011. Carry Me is the first track from the new album to have had its first play on national radio, on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show. It kicks off with range of samples and synthesizers and, at first listen, the electronic sound seems to be a radical departure from the three albums which precede it. However subsequent buzz on social networking sites has been positive despite Steadman's worries about fans' reactions. "The reaction has been the best we've had so far to new music," says Nash. But, playing a stealthy get out of jail free card, Steadman adds: "The stage we are at now, is that the expectation is the unexpected. So when people hear our single and it sounds completely different, then that comforts them I think because that's what they want". Take that would-be haters. The song's video too, is a massive step forward and allows the viewers to animate the band and two dancers. They have used stop-motion animation before in the video for How Can You Swallow So Much Sleep from their last album. The new video is inspired by the work of Eadweard Muybridge, an English pioneer of in motion-picture projection, most famous for his horse in motion, produced in 1878. Feel, another of the albums tracks begins with a sample of Bollywood-style music, influenced by a month Steadman spent in Mumbai. "Even before I went, I was getting into old Hindi film soundtracks and collecting them and there isn't really another style of music which has the same number of really catchy hooks," he explains. Rather than following the rather cliched well-trodden path of travelling to India to find himself spiritually, the singer immersed himself in the fast-moving, cacophonous buzz of the city which is home to 20 million people. "It's probably the most high-paced and generally crazy city that I've ever been to which meant I couldn't really relax, I always wanted to jump up run around make music." Nash, however, admits he spent the same amount of time in the altogether more sedate setting of Goa, the beach resort on India's west coast, "Yeah, I took one for the team," he smiles. Another track, Luna, begins with an Indian Tabla drum before launching into a piece of '80s-inspired synth-pop. Recorded at The Kinks' Konk Studios in London, the album is the first that Steadman has entirely produced himself. "We did go through a couple of producers but when it didn't work, we said, 'We think we've been avoiding the subject but maybe should do it ourselves'. It was a difficult decision," he admits. "The label has been good with us, I think they trust us, we're not a self indulgent band and we have no qualms about turning a song into something that's quite poppy". And the Chemical Brothers reference suggests the band want fans at forthcoming live shows to pull on their dancing shoes. "Yeah because some of our gigs have turned into manly fights with people killing each other", says Steadman. "It's quite a sight to behold because sometimes we're playing a really soft song and this circle in the pit starts and people are throwing punches at each other. "Sometimes the music we play is very aggressive." There is talk of a UK tour sometime early in the spring but for the time being there is the small matter of a name for the album. "There's a few things in the pipeline," said Nash. "It needs to sum up Eadweard Muybridge and loops and themes of the album. It's quite difficult". Any suggestions? </body>

      <title>Beatles in Belfast - 50 years ago</title>
      <description>The day the Beatles came to Belfast</description>

      <body>These were the scenes in Belfast city centre 50 years ago. Thousands of screaming fans gathered outside the Ritz Cinema in Fisherwick Place to catch a glimpse of the band that was making people scream, cry and faint during their 1963 Autumn tour. Among the crowd was 13-year-old Margaret Flynn. She was not able to get a ticket - but nevertheless, she wanted to soak up the atmosphere. "My friends and I walked down the Grosvenor Road to the Ritz and were just met with a sea of people," she said. "Screaming girls and lots of boys too - but of course we weren't getting anywhere near it. The police had crowd control and barriers everywhere." One of the officers on duty that night was Evelyn - who remembers seeing girls crying on each others' shoulders and fainting. She said there was a big security operation in the city centre. It was a great night for her because she was also a Beatles fan and got to see the Fab Four as they walked into the cinema. She said one of them - she cannot remember who - even waved at her. "I think I floated back to the station that night." Others like schoolboy Christopher Hill - now a professional photographer - queued up all night to get tickets a month before the band came to play. He got a seat on the second row in the middle and was able to capture some great photographs. He ended up selling around 800 of them to local students. "I had girls at the local schools who sold them for me without commission just for the glory of being able to sell these original Beatles photographs. People still bump into me and say: 'I remember the photographs I bought from you in 1963,'" he said. One of those who still treasures one of those photographs is his friend Chris MaCabe who was with him that night. The day after the concert he got his hair styled exactly like the Beatles. He remembers it as being a time of change for Northern Ireland "As I recall there were some protests from politicians and church leaders who felt the Beatles were breaking a mould that wasn't acceptable... Belfast was a very strict place and the Beatles brought a degree of fun, and I suppose broke down some barriers because they were extremely innocent and their songs at that time were very innocent too," he said. For some, like Margaret, who didn't manage to see the Beatles this time - there would be success in the future. The Beatles returned to Belfast in 1964 to play the Ulster Hall and, that time, she did managed to get tickets. </body>

      <title>The Good King Joffrey</title>
      <description>Game of Thrones' Jack Gleeson makes charity visit to Haiti</description>

      <body>It's a testament to Jack Gleeson's acting ability that most Game of Thrones fans may have to look twice at this picture. The young Irish actor is usually seen playing the tyrannical King Joffrey Baratheon - a man so evil, his own mother isn't sure she loves him. The role has propelled Jack to international acclaim, but unlike his bullish on-screen counterpart he is using his good fortune to help others. Earlier this week he travelled to the Haitian capital of Port au Prince to see the humanitarian work being carried out there by the charity Goal. It's almost four years since a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the country, displacing around 1.5m people. Jack described his trip as a "tremendous honour" and insisted it wasn't about distancing himself from the barbarous monarch he portrays on our TV screens. He willingly admits that he does not care what people think. "That's nothing to do with it really," he told the BBC. "I usually like to keep a low profile but that's a personal thing. I think that increases the audience's reaction to the show. They see me purely as the character." The HBO series has become a cult hit since its premier in 2011. Based on the novel A Song of Ice and Fire, it interweaves the stories of several noble houses, who are engaged in a raging civil war. Although the show features plenty of egregious villains, viewers would unanimously agree King Joffrey is in a league of his own. "I do get a bit of a shock when I see some of the scripts," said Jack. "But most of the time I read a scene and I rub my hands with glee. I get to work outside the standard back and forth dialogue. It's a very theatrical role." Much of the show is filmed on location in Northern Ireland and at the Titanic Studios in Belfast. Jack describes the city as "a home away from home". "I think the rest of the cast really like it too. Some of them took an exception to the weather, but in terms of Belfast people and Northern Irish people they're so welcoming," he said. "You don't really get stopped or asked for a picture. Perhaps they're too modest. They kind of leave us to it." Filming for the fourth season of the series will come to an end in the coming weeks, with the first episode due to air in March 2014. There are no impending spoilers ahead. Jack refused to divulge what happens next. "I can't really say too much. But the characters are getting more and more desperate and more intense. There are also some new characters and some will be leaving. "I actually read the first book, along with the online summaries. So I know the fate of my character. "Some of the cast haven't read it, like Lena Headey. I know she really enjoys watching the show so every time she gets a script it's the unknown." Although his day job is a time-consuming one, Jack manages to pursue several other projects and is a full-time student at Trinity College in Dublin. His trip to Haiti presented the 21-year-old with an altogether different challenge and got him out of his "comfort zone". He visited several projects including schools and housing camps and spent time with people who lost loved ones and livelihoods in the disaster. It's a far cry from the glamour of the television set. "It was very surreal," said Jack, as he described the moment he landed in Port au Prince. "It's a profound juxtaposition to find yourself in. Not just from my fictional character, but from my real life in Dublin. "When it's presented in the media it's very easy to abstract yourself and fictionalise the event. "Haiti was a profoundly impoverished country even before the earthquake, so to see it get back on its feet is uplifting. "They're so self-motivated here." Despite landing a lead role in a hit TV series and embarking on charity missions across the world, Jack is unsure whether life in the spotlight is entirely right for him. He has spoken of his desire to step away from acting in favour of a career in academia something he feels "really guilty about". "Everyone dreams of working on a successful show and it is a great opportunity. "I haven't decided yet. Acting isn't my priority at the moment. I really like being a student. "But I'm reticent to speak in definites. I'm a young bright-eyed man, so I may change my mind." Game of Thrones fans will certainly hope so. </body>

      <title>James Arthur: I don't want to be a robot</title>
      <description>James Arthur moves on from X Factor</description>

      <body>X Factor winner James Arthur talks about his mission to stay authentic, his dreams of working with Eminem and why he won't do media training. It's almost a year since he clinched victory from Jahmene Douglas in the 2012 X Factor final, scoring the show's fastest-selling winner's single ever - and the biggest single of 2012 - with a cover of Shontelle's Impossible. Now this week sees the release of Arthur's self-titled debut album. So James, how does it feel to finally have your own album coming out? I'm excited because I'm proud of it. I don't feel as though it sounds contrived or compromised, or overly produced or poppy or anything like that. I feel like there's pop songs on there but they're really - I hate using the word credible now - but they're really authentic sounding. The words are coming from me. It includes songs like Smoke Clouds and Suicide - not your average X Factor subject matter. Do you think you might genuinely be allowed to be yourself? I didn't ever work against [the X Factor team] but I would challenge them and I don't think they were used to that. I knew exactly what I wanted to do, who I wanted to be, which market I want to appeal to. They realised that if they didn't give me the licence I required then they won't get the best out of me. Emeli Sande co-wrote and sings on your track Roses, what was that like? It was absolutely incredible - for someone who was sat in his bedsit last year watching Emeli Sande on the TV. There is one artist in this country that is definitely for real, I feel like she just oozes artistry. They're the people I want to work with, people who understand that you have to be vulnerable when you're making music. You have to let your guard down and she does that so well. Who's next on the list then? I really want to work with Eminem. I know it will never happen, but I would love if he let me do a hook on one of his songs or he featured on one of my songs, it would be incredible. I've just always admired him since I was young. I admire the way he plays the media, the way he doesn't care what people think about him, yet he's so inspiring to so many people. And he's the best rapper on the earth. You mention the media. You've generated quite a few headlines yourself with things you've said recently - is that something you've done on purpose? A lot of the time it's just me being me, in the heat of the moment. I don't think about consequences too much. I want to be an example to people, so that in five year's time people say: "James always said what he thought, what he felt". I've done a few face palms after things I've said because it's stupid. But if I'm not like that I won't feel human anymore. I'll just feel like some robot saying what I'm supposed to say. I think that's when people lose it. Has anyone tried to media train you? I don't do media training. I don't do that. But has anyone suggested that you do it? Yeah. But what's the point in me getting up in the morning and coming in and speaking to 20 journalists and having a script in my mind? It's soul destroying. I'd rather just have a chat. The media like to twist things, that's the way it is. The things I've spoken out on [X Factor hopefuls Kingsland Road, One Direction] are not important things. It's just popular culture. But you have spoken about your own experiences - having panic attacks, contemplating suicide. They're big issues aren't they? You know when you read those things it looks like I've sat here and gone: "I've had such a bad year, I've contemplated suicide". But it's usually in passing: "Yeah couple of meltdowns I had last year". I did feel like I could have fell on my face and never woke up again, but then it gets made to look like I've sat here crying to the journalist and it's not the case. I'm just saying it's been hard, and it's the same with any profession. When you're under pressure you wish that you could just remove yourself completely from it. It is a massive change in lifestyle though, you walking in here with a couple of stylists and all the rest of it... Yeah, if I'd have sat there and said it's all been a walk in the park, nobody would believe you. It's hard, it's really weird. You can't have a night out any more because you see people getting more and more drunk and plucking up the courage to come and talk to you, and it kind of freaks you out. Even the people that you've grown up with. It's like, "Really? I'm the same dude who puked all over the front room one night". I've heard how so many people come from shows like X Factor and never recover. I want to have forgotten about it in 10 years time and had another life. Some people are very critical of the X Factor format and cynical about people that come through it, do you feel you have to fight back against that in a way? Yeah, I think it's amusing that. It's like, "why don't you just enjoy it?" It's entertainment, no one's trying to hurt anybody. I'm a big fan of the show. I don't want to be seen to be going, "I'm too credible, the X Factor's not how I want to be associated", because I think people have made that error in the past and it just makes you look like a pretentious idiot. I'm really proud to have come from it. It can be the only way to launch people now. On your UK tour next year you have an extra date in Middlesbrough, why was that important to you? It's going to be special because it's going to be the whole home town thing. They haven't had a show off me yet. I've only been there like twice [since winning X Factor]. I love where I come from. It's really important to give back to those people because they were probably the majority of people that voted for me, you know. James Arthur is out now. </body>

      <title>Is there an 'angst canon' of books that teenagers read?</title>
      <description>Do teenagers still read the same rite of passage books?</description>

      <body>It's 100 years since the birth of Albert Camus. His book The Outsider is one of a select set of works that generations of disaffected teenagers have turned to as a rite of passage. The 1942 novel, also known as The Stranger, is about a French Algerian's seemingly irrational murder of an Arab and his subsequent indifference to his own execution. Central character Meursault is a man alienated from the society in which he lives. There's The Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger. Central character Holden is alienated from the society in which he lives. George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is a critique of totalitarian societies, but it's also about Winston Smith and his alienation from the society in which he lives. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World provides a dystopian vision of the world - through the eyes of a man alienated from the society in which he lives. Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar has a female protagonist whose mental illness is partly because of her alienation from a society which has fixed expectations of women. Then there's Joseph Heller's Catch-22 where central character Yossarian is rather alienated. And Franz Kafka's The Trial where… You get the picture. These books have formed a kind of canon of disaffected literature for disaffected teenagers. At the age of 17 and 18, readers are often searching for something with a bit of existential angst. And nothing taps into teenage angst quite like the idea of exceptionalism. The books in "the canon" can provide a feeling of uniqueness - a clandestine understanding of the world that nobody else quite gets. "'I can see through this, and Kafka can, but you can't'," says Guardian literary critic Nicholas Lezard of the feeling. "'Me and Kafka, we're buddies.'" A book like Catch-22 provides a prism for teenage readers, says Prof John Sutherland, an English literature professor at University College London. "It had sort of this ironic view of the adult world, where you're always trapped. [These books are] intellectual breakthrough stuff, a way of breaking out, a rite of passage." As well as looking for echoes of their disaffection, teenagers are also often attempting to look, well, a bit cool. The books are like a badge of honour. An actual badge, in Lezard's case. "I found a badge for sale that just had the word 'Outsider' on it," he says. "I wore that on my school blazer for a bit." The book itself might be placed conspicuously on show, with the titles poking out of school blazer pockets and tops of satchels. "[They're] what you might call 'accessory books'," says Sutherland. "The book was, as it were, to make a statement. It was particularly pronounced in 1960s, 70s and 80s adolescence. People used to sit around in coffee shops holding a copy of whatever the latest Samuel Beckett was and probably couldn't answer how many Ts there are in Beckett." Any teenager seen reading the book on public transport is sending out a message. "You know that if you sit on the Tube reading that [type of book], people will know you're an angst-ridden teenager," says historian Lisa Jardine, who has researched the reading preferences of men and women. Some may even detect a note of pretentiousness although most teenagers stop short of sporting a beret and pipe and disdainfully peering over a French-language copy of L'Etranger [The Outsider]. But calling the majority of teenagers pretentious is too harsh, says Jardine. "I don't like that word. I would call it 'statement reading'," she says. "They're exploring them, and they're struggling with them, and therefore it's more about statement than showing off. You swap [the fact] that you've read these books and then you know you've got a kindred spirit." Even if there is some posturing, it's not unhealthy, says Lezard, as it's partly about raising your game into adulthood - and some of the ideas do filter in. "So I don't regret any of this," he says. "Perhaps the badge." But the canon of teenage angst books is not the same for both sexes. "There's an absolutely dramatic difference between what girls and boys read at puberty," says Jardine. "Boys read angst books, so they read Catcher in the Rye, L'Etranger and books like that. Girls read expanding emotion and sensibility books. Jane Eyre, [Dodie Smith's] I Capture the Castle, the Brontes… books about difficult relationships. "It was absolutely staggering how little teenage angst books came up on the women's list." Men also tend to cling on to their teenage favourites later into life more than women, Jardine's research showed. But does the canon stay the same? And is there always a group of angsty teenagers to read it? "Nineteen Eighty-Four makes you re-evaluate society," says 17-year-old Enosh Ghimire, from Ealing, west London. "It's a common theme in many of the books - criticising society or evaluating what society is." The canon itself isn't stable. New books may be added, others fall by the wayside. A good movie adaptation can be an obstacle. Trainspotting, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - those reaching adolescence after these films came out had to be extra committed to read the books after watching them - or disciplined enough to read them first. Ghimire says he and many of his friends enjoy reading Game of Thrones and that many are reading the Hunger Games, both of which have popular TV or movie franchises to accompany them. Laura Hampson, 18, from Liverpool, says her friends don't read that much but "they've read The Perks of Being a Wallfower recently because of the film". Hampson is a fan of contemporary John Green titles Looking for Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines. But she says her favourite book is David Nicholls's popular book One Day, pointing to its unusual time structure and relatable characters. "It didn't make out either character was without fault," she adds. "With some romance books the other character can sometimes be described as this perfect person, which most people can't relate to." Another obstacle to the cultish or cool feel of books in the canon is the way many of them have been absorbed into English literature syllabuses on both sides of the Atlantic over the past 30 years. Ghimire studies both Brave New World and Nineteen Eighty-Four as part of his course, admitting that they're not books he'd normally read. "School opens [them] up," he says. "I wouldn't have known about Brave New World if it wasn't for school. School made me aware that there are other books outside of what I would normally read." But news and current affairs makes some of the books resonate further, he says, citing the Edward Snowden spying affair as making Nineteen Eighty-Four really click. "And Brave New World is going to be relevant for a long time because of technological advances," Ghimire says. And it's only with a sense of irony, or perhaps disappointment, that teenagers realise their mum's favourite book was also Nineteen Eighty-Four and their dad's was Catch-22. "The feeling of being awkward and unhappy at school is in fact perennial," says Sutherland. Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>
