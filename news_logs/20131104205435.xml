      <body>Egypt's ousted leader Mohammed Morsi has gone on trial in Cairo, telling the judge the case is illegitimate as he remains president. He and 14 other Muslim Brotherhood figures face charges of inciting the killing of protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012. After Mr Morsi's remarks and his refusal to wear a uniform, the judge adjourned the trial until 8 January. He was then flown to Burj al-Arab prison in Alexandria. Security officials told the BBC Mr Morsi was transferred after registration to the prison hospital for a routine medical check. He is awaiting a medical report which will determine whether he will be sent to a cell or kept at the hospital, they added. Earlier reports had suggested that he would be taken to Tora prison on the outskirts of Cairo. Until now he had been held at a secret military location. Protests took place outside the court and elsewhere in Cairo. Mr Morsi was ousted by the military in July after protests against his rule. Early on Monday Mr Morsi was brought into the sprawling Police Academy compound by helicopter. Other defendants, including Essam el-Erian, Mohammed al-Beltagi and Ahmed Abdel Aatie, were said to have arrived in armoured personnel carriers. No television pictures were broadcast from the court although journalists were allowed in for the former president's first public appearance since he was deposed on 3 July. As he entered the courtroom, Mr Morsi refused to remove his blue suit and put on the required white prison uniform. The defendants, who were being held in a cage in the courtroom, chanted "illegal, illegal". When asked to give his name, the former president gave a defiant response, according to reporters inside the court. "I am Dr Mohammed Morsi, the president of the republic. I am Egypt's legitimate president. You have no right to conduct a trial into presidential matters." The judge twice temporarily halted proceedings before adjourning the case until January. Before the trial began Mr el-Erian, a deputy leader of the Brotherhood's political wing, told the BBC that one of his fellow defendants had been mistreated with some kind of water torture and had been beaten until he was on the point of collapse. Mr Morsi and the 14 other members of the Muslim Brotherhood had been widely expected to use the occasion to underline what they see as the illegitimacy of his removal from power. Police had to step in at one point because of heckling in the court. The BBC's Orla Guerin says some of those attending the trial, including women journalists, shouted that the defendants should be given the death penalty. The trial had been due to take place at Tora prison on the other side of Cairo but had been switched late on Sunday, apparently to deter protesters. Shortly after Mr Morsi's arrival, a small crowd arrived and began chanting outside the police compound more than one hour's drive from the centre of the city. The crowd soon grew and protesters were briefly seen on state TV chanting slogans against army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who led Mr Morsi's removal from power. Demonstrators shouted at a state TV crew and chanted "liars" before chasing them and pelting them with stones. Other protests took place in Cairo itself, outside the High Court in the centre of the city and at the Supreme Constitutional Court in the south. While state institutions were said to have opened normally on Monday, some private schools had told parents to keep their children at home. Although Mr Morsi won the presidency in a democratic election, during his 13 months in power he fell out with key institutions. The ex-president is accused of "inciting his supporters to carry out premeditated murder, and inciting the use of violence and thuggery" over the deaths of at least 10 people during intense clashes in December 2012 which followed a decree that gave him wide-ranging powers. After he was ousted, a sit-in protest at Rabaa al-Adawiya Square in Cairo by Mr Morsi's supporters was violently broken up by the military, leading to the deaths of hundreds of people. The interim government has also cracked down on the Muslim Brotherhood, banning the Islamist organisation and arresting dozens of senior figures. Pro-Morsi supporters say he was removed in a coup and is now facing a politicised trial. Human rights groups accuse the security services of acting without accountability. Legal experts say that if convicted Mr Morsi could be jailed for life or face the death penalty. His senior communications adviser, Wael Haddara, told the BBC that the process was a "charade" because everyone involved had been appointed by the military. "What is the military afraid of? Why won't they let him speak? Even prisoners have rights." The National Police Academy is also hosting the trial of his predecessor, Hosni Mubarak, - meaning there are two former Egyptian presidents being tried concurrently. An estimated 20,000 security personnel have been deployed to keep order amid fears that the trial could deepen the rift between Egyptians and cause greater unrest. On Sunday evening, gunmen killed two Egyptian policemen near the city of Ismailia. Send your pictures and videos to yourpics@bbc.co.uk or text them to 61124 (UK) or +44 7624 800 100 (International).

      <title>Blackberry abandons sell-off plan</title>
      <description>Shares in struggling smartphone maker Blackberry fall 13% after it abandons plans to sell itself to its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings.</description>

      <body>Shares in struggling smartphone maker Blackberry have fallen 13% after it announced it had abandoned a plan to sell itself to its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings. Instead, it intends to raise $1bn (£627m) in fresh financing. Chief executive Thorsten Heins will step down and former Sybase chief executive John Chen will serve as interim chief executive. Last month, Blackberry reported a second-quarter net loss of $965m. Those losses were blamed on poor sales of its new smartphone, the Z10. Fairfax was planning to lead a consortium of firms in a takeover of Blackberry worth $4.7bn. But that plan, announced last month, has fallen through. Last week, Reuters reported that Fairfax was struggling to raise the financing needed for the deal. Instead, Fairfax, which owns a 10% stake in Blackberry, is contributing $250m to the new fund-raising. "This financing provides an immediate cash injection on terms favourable to Blackberry, enhancing our substantial cash position," said Barbara Stymiest, chair of Blackberry's board of directors. In September, the company announced a plan to cut 4,500 jobs, or 40% of its workforce, to reverse giant losses. The interim chief executive, John Chen, acknowledged the challenge ahead: "Blackberry is an iconic brand with enormous potential - but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success." Some analysts remain sceptical about the firm's prospects. "Now we're back to the downward spiral," said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. "They've got $1bn more cash that buys them time. The drumbeat of negativity is likely to continue." </body>

      <title>Fighting 'empties' DR Congo town</title>
      <description>The entire population of Bunagana town in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo flees fighting between government and rebel forces, residents say.</description>

      <body>The entire population of Bunagana town in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has fled fighting between government and rebel forces, residents say. The BBC's Ignatius Bahizi, who is on the Ugandan side of the town, says missiles are being fired, killing four people. The government on Monday rejected the M23 rebel group's call for a ceasefire. At least 800,000 people have fled their homes since the conflict began in March 2012. Last week, the UN special envoy to DR Congo, Martin Kobler, said the group was all but finished as a military threat in DR Congo. Government forces captured Bunagana, the main base of the M23 on the DR Congo-Uganda border, the next day. However, fresh fighting erupted on Monday and the mood on the border is very tense, our correspondent says. Refugees have told him that only Congolese government troops are now in Bunagana, with the town's several thousand residents fleeing into Uganda. Other BBC reporters in the area say the rebels seem to be fighting back more fiercely than on previous days. But government troops have taken Mbuzi, a strategic hilltop above Bunagana, after hitting it with tank and rocket fire, UN sources have told the BBC. Seven rebels were captured, Reuters news agency reports. "Victory, Victory," soldiers in the nearby town of Ntamugenga chanted after receiving a radio message that Mbuzi was under government control, a journalist with the AFP news agency reports from the scene. Government forces are now targeting three other hilltops, where dozens of rebels are hiding, an army official told AFP. Shells fired by the M23 have fallen on both sides of the border, with at least four people killed and 17 wounded in DR Congo, various sources have told the BBC. They said the shells had landed on a market and a police station in Bunagana. Ugandan district commissioner Ahmed Mustapher Doka told the BBC's Focus on Africa radio programme that Ugandan troops have been deployed near the border to instil "confidence" in the population. Ugandan territory was shelled on four occasions as the fighting spilled over, he said. Security officials ordered the closure of shops along the border, and told residents to move deeper into Ugandan territory, our reporter says. The latest violence follows a string of victories by government troops who have driven rebels from all towns they once controlled during a 20-month rebellion. Peace talks in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, broke down last month following two months of negotiations. On Sunday, M23 leader Bertrand Bisimwa called for a ceasefire to "allow the continuation of the political process". He urged rebel commanders to "ensure the strict observance of this order". However, on Monday the M23 said in a statement that the government had launched a new assault using "heavy arms". Government spokesman Lambert Mende said the government wanted the M23 to "clearly announce the end of their armed rebellion". The M23 should also give up its weapons, he said, in a statement. However, the government was prepared to give the M23 "one last chance", Mr Mende added, without elaborating. BBC Africa security correspondent Moses Rono says the defeat of the M23 would send a powerful message to at least 10 other rebel groups operating in the area. It would raise hope that a lasting peace for the troubled nation may be in sight, he adds. The M23 movement is named after a 23 March 2009 peace deal that ended four years of rebellion in eastern DR Congo. They took up arms once more in April 2012, accusing the government of not respecting the agreement. The rebels briefly occupied the eastern Congolese city of Goma in November 2012 before pulling out under international pressure. Government forces have been backed by a UN intervention brigade deployed earlier this year to confront the M23 and other armed groups. Eastern DR Congo has been wracked by conflict since 1994, when Hutu militias fled across the border from Rwanda after carrying out a genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The M23 are mainly ethnic Tutsis, like most of Rwanda's current leaders. Rwanda and Uganda deny Congolese and UN claims that they have supported the M23 rebels. </body>

      <body>A man wielding a knife has hijacked a bus in western Norway and killed three passengers, media reports say. The suspect, said to be in his 50s and of foreign origin, has been arrested, police told Norway's TV2 news channel. The victims included the driver of the bus. There were no immediate details of the number of injured. The man was overpowered by firefighters who rushed to the scene of what was initially reported as a traffic accident, police said. The attack took place around 17:30 local time (16:30 GMT) on a remote mountain road near Ardal, about 220km (136 miles) north-west of Oslo. "For now, I have no information to indicate there was anyone else than the three victims" on the bus, police officer Joern Lasse Foerde Refsnes told TV2. The motive for the attack was not immediately clear. The suspect is being treated in hospital for knife wounds, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation said. Police in Oslo were preparing to send an anti-terror unit to the scene aboard army helicopters but called off the deployment after the suspect was arrested, the news channel said. </body>

      <body>Wall Street hedge fund giant SAC Capital has agreed to plead guilty to insider trading charges, according to the US Attorney's office. The firm, founded and run by billionaire manager Steven Cohen, will pay $1.8bn (£1.1bn) to settle the charges, a US Attorney statement said. SAC has also agreed to give up its investment advisory business, it added. The fund was charged in July with four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. Full details of the settlement are due to be revealed later, according to a notice sent by the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara. The settlement comes after a seven-year-long investigation. In July, SAC pleaded not guilty in a New York court and denied the insider trading charges. Prosecutors had alleged that the fund was involved in "systematic insider trading" that allowed it to make hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profits. Prosecutors said the alleged crimes dated back to 1999 and continued until at least 2010. They allege that SAC obtained inside information on publicly traded companies and traded on that information to boost returns and fees. "[SAC's] relentless pursuit of an information 'edge' fostered a business culture within SAC in which there was no meaningful commitment to ensure that such 'edge' came from legitimate research and not inside information," court filings said. At its peak, SAC Capital managed about $15bn in assets. </body>

      <description>Saudi Arabia begins detaining thousands of illegal migrant workers, after an amnesty introducing new employment rules expired.</description>

      <body>Saudi Arabia is rounding up thousands of illegal migrant workers, after an amnesty introducing new employment rules expired. Nearly a million Bangladeshis, Indians, Filipinos, Nepalis, Pakistanis and Yemenis are estimated to have left the country in the last three months. Four million others obtained work permits before Sunday's deadline. Some 3,000 Indonesian illegal workers in Jeddah are in detention, awaiting deportation, Indonesian officials say. They had gathered under a flyover with all their belongings, giving themselves up to the authorities. An estimated nine million migrant workers in Saudi Arabia - more than half the workforce - fill manual, clerical, and service jobs. Saudi Arabia has the Arab world's largest economy, but the authorities are trying to reduce the 12% unemployment rate among native Saudis. The government is carrying out its threat that if any illegal migrants are left they will be punished by fines, prison or deportation. Companies that break the new rules will also face penalties. Human Rights Watch has denounced the country's labour system as "abusive". "The kafala, or sponsorship system ties migrant workers' residency permits to sponsoring employers, whose written consent is required for workers to change employers or leave the country," it has said. "Employers often abuse this power in violation of Saudi law to confiscate passports, withhold wages and force migrants to work against their will or on exploitative terms." </body>

      <title>L'Aquila EU relief funds 'misused'</title>
      <description>A special EU inquiry criticises the "misuse" of EU funds intended to help rebuild the Italian city of L'Aquila, devastated by a 2009 earthquake.</description>

      <body>A special EU inquiry has criticised what it called the misuse of EU funds intended to help rebuild the Italian city of L'Aquila, which was devastated by an earthquake in 2009. The EU had made available 493,700 euros (£418,000: $666,000) for the region from its Solidarity Fund. But the report said there were serious allegations some of that money went to contractors linked to organised crime. More than 300 were killed in the quake and some 10,000 buildings damaged. In the report, EU rapporteur Soren Bo Sondergaard said there were serious allegations that part of the money spent on building new accommodation for the quake's victims was paid to companies with "direct or indirect ties" to organised crime. He also criticised as dangerous and unhealthy some of the new accommodation built in the town. He added "wanted criminals" were found at a factory run by one of the contractors. Much of the rapporteur's criticism is directed at the European Union Commission in Brussels, says the BBC's Alan Johnston in Rome. Mr Sondergaard said it should have been much more diligent in its efforts to ensure that EU taxpayers' money was better spent. There have been building projects on the town's outskirts to house victims of the quake, but reconstruction has barely begun in the town, our correspondent says. The historic centre of L'Aquila is a ghost town; its squares and alleyways are deserted, while damaged medieval buildings are being propped up on steel supports, he adds. The report is also scathing about the cost and the quality of some of the new accommodation. Dozens of families had to be evacuated because their homes were "dangerous and unhealthy", it says. One accommodation area caught fire because of a faulty electrical system; and there have been problems with sewers, water pipes and cracking walls. Regarding the quality of houses, Massimo Cialente, mayor of L'Aquila, told the BBC: "Some of the houses built have never-ending issues and we spend lots of money repairing them." But on the subject of whether funds were misused, Mr Cialente said: "I am inclined to exclude the possibility." "There was lots of attention from judges and anti-Mafia prosecutors to prevent this from happening. We will have to wait for the court documents." </body>

      <title>Swiss refiner 'laundered DRC gold'</title>
      <description>A major Swiss gold refiner is being investigated on suspicion of money laundering linked to the processing of gold allegedly looted from DR Congo.</description>

      <body>A major Swiss gold refiner is being investigated on suspicion of money laundering linked to the processing of gold allegedly looted from DR Congo. Swiss federal prosecutors confirmed criminal proceedings against Argor-Heraeus SA, over claims it knew gold it handled in 2004 and 2005 had been taken from DR Congo during an armed conflict. The case has been brought by the Swiss non-governmental organisation TRIAL. Argor-Heraeus has strongly refuted all allegations in a statement. The Swiss gold refiner said the allegation had "arrived like a bolt out of the blue" and there had been "no request or contact whatsoever from TRIAL beforehand". It said "Argor-Heraeus has been cleared of all above mentioned allegations", referring to an investigation at the time by the UN, SECO and FINMA. The firm said it would "collaborate in complete transparency with the authorities" to prove its innocence. The Swiss federal prosecutor's office said on Monday that after reviewing the criminal complaint submitted by TRIAL, it had decided to initiate proceedings against Argor-Heraeus "for suspected money laundering in connection with a war crime and complicity in war crimes". "Given the secrecy of the investigation and function, we are not able to provide more information for now," it said. TRIAL alleges that gold looted from DR Congo in 2004 and 2005 was smuggled to Uganda and then refined in Switzerland by Argor-Heraeus. According to TRIAL, the refinery knew or should have assumed that the gold resulted from pillage, a war crime. DR Congo was in the midst of an armed conflict at the time, driven partly for control of natural resources. An estimated six million people are believed to have been killed in DR Congo since 1997. TRIAL says the sale of the gold "contributed to financing the operations of an unlawful armed group in a brutal conflict". A report at the time by a UN Group of Experts recommended sanctions against Argor, saying the company must have known the gold was obtained illegally. Sanctions were imposed only on Ugandan businesses involved in the trade. TRIAL alleges that Argor escaped sanctions because of pressure applied at the UN by Swiss diplomats. However, Argor says that "subsequent detailed in-depth verifications executed by SECO and UNO resulted in the removal of the name of Argor-Heraeus from the report and confirmed that the company was in no way directly or indirectly involved in the alleged claim". Most of the world's gold is refined in Switzerland and the country is also a major trading hub for gold and other commodities. The BBC's Imogen Foulkes in Geneva says there is growing pressure for traders and refiners to be more transparent. Argor is owned partly by German company Heraeus, Commerzbank, and the Austrian Mint. </body>

      <body>Four people have been charged over the siege at the Westgate shopping centre in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, in which at least 67 were killed, police say. The four foreigners have been charged with aiding terrorist groups and being in Kenya illegally. Their nationalities have not been disclosed, but they are said to be ethnic Somalis. These are the first charges to be brought in relation to the four-day September siege. Those charged have been named as Mohammed Ahmed Abdi, Liban Abdullah, Adnan Ibrahim and Hussein Hassan. "The accused persons carried out a terrorist attack at Westgate Shopping Mall on 21 September by supporting a terrorist group," the charge sheet read. The police say the four accused had sheltered the attackers in their homes in Eastleigh - a Somali neighbourhood in Nairobi - and that they were in contact with the gunmen four days before the siege. All four, who had no lawyer, have pleaded not guilty to the charges, which also included obtaining false identification documents. None of the men is accused of being the gunmen in the centre. The court has ordered them to be remanded at a local police station after the prosecution asked for more time for further investigations. The Somali militant Islamist group al-Shabab said it carried out the attack. The Kenyan army has said that all four of the attackers died during the siege. One of the suspected attackers has been named as 23-year-old Somalia-born Norwegian national, Hassan Abdi Dhuhulow. </body>

      <body>A judge in Spain has ordered properties belonging to the king's son-in-law to be impounded amid a corruption scandal that has embarrassed the royal family. Inaki Urdangarin, the Duke of Palma, is suspected of misusing millions of euros in public funds that were given to a charitable foundation he ran. The judge ordered the seizure to cover a 6.1m euro (£5.23m: $8.2m) bond for the duke's liability in the case. The duke has denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with any crime. The former Olympic handball player is married to King Juan Carlos's second child, the Infanta Cristina. One of the properties targeted by the judge is a large luxury house on the outskirts of Barcelona belonging to the duke and Princess Cristina. Several other properties belonging to them in the Balearic Islands and in north-east Spain have also been seized. The duke and his former business partner Diego Torres are suspected of siphoning off money given by regional governments to the Noos Institute to organise sporting events. It is alleged that some of the money ended up in companies controlled by the duke and in offshore bank accounts. The events allegedly happened between 2004 and 2006, when the duke stepped down as head of the institute. Mr Torres has also denied any wrongdoing. The duke was suspended from official royal engagements in December last year. The princess, who is seventh in line to the throne and also denies any wrongdoing, recently moved to Switzerland in the hope of shielding the couple's children from unwanted media attention. Juan Carlos is credited with guiding Spain's transition to democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. </body>

      <description>Details emerge of how nine US skydivers and two pilots escaped as their planes crashed in midair, turning one of the aircraft into a "fireball".</description>

      <body>Details have emerged of how nine US skydivers and two pilots escaped as their planes crashed in midair, turning one of the aircraft into a "fireball". Four skydivers were preparing to jump when their plane collided with another, carrying five skydivers, at 12,000ft (3,600m) in the state of Wisconsin. All the skydivers safely jumped. One pilot ejected with a parachute and the other safely landed the second plane. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating Saturday's near tragedy. All of the skydivers were either instructors or coaches who have completed hundreds of previous jumps. Instructor Mike Robinson, 64, said that he and three other skydivers had climbed out on to the step of the Cessna 182 in preparation for their jump. "We were just a few seconds away from having a normal skydive when the trail plane came over the top of the lead aircraft and came down on top of it," he said. "It turned into a big flash fireball, and the wing separated. All of us knew we had a crash. The wing over our head was gone, so we just left." He watched as the aircraft fell in pieces from the sky. The pilot of the plane, who ejected with a parachute that could not be steered, suffered minor injuries. The second pilot landed the plane safely at Richard I Bong Airport, Douglas County. A witness on the ground told the Duluth News Tribune he heard a "boom and looked up and there's a fireball and smoke". Braydon Kurtz said one plane "was circling down and one was going down straight". Mr Robinson said while everyone responded professionally and quickly, they were lucky to have been in place to jump when the collision happened. "It might've been a lot worse," he said. "Everybody, to a person, responded just as they should, including the pilots." A skydiving accident in Belgium last month killed 11 people when a plane went into a nosedive as part of its wing broke minutes after take-off. </body>

      <body>Security forces have arrested and questioned a number of suspects over the deaths of two French journalists in northern Mali, officials say. Radio France Internationale's Ghislaine Dupont, 57, and Claude Verlon, 58, were kidnapped and killed on Saturday after interviewing a local leader in Kidal. France's Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said operations were ongoing to find the attackers. He has described the deaths as "cold and calculated assassinations". The bodies of the two journalists have been moved to the Malian capital, Bamako, ahead of their repatriation later on Monday, according to RFI. The desert town of Kidal is at the centre of a political dispute between ethnic Tuareg nomads and the rest of the population of Mali, who are black Africans. In an interview with French radio on Monday, Mr Fabius declined to confirm previous reports that French forces had arrested five suspects and transferred them to the city of Gao. But he said efforts were continuing to "identify a certain number of people in camps". Meanwhile, French news agency AFP quoted a police source in Gao as saying a dozen suspects had been arrested over the deaths of the journalists. And an unnamed intelligence official told the Associated Press that about six people had been detained. "We believe that of the people they now have in custody, they have at least one of the four killers," the official said. Mr Fabius said sound engineer Mr Verlon and reporter Ms Dupont were killed about 12km (seven miles) east of Kidal. One had been shot with two bullets, the other three. Mr Fabius called the killers "terrorist groups who reject democracy". He said investigators suspected the involvement of Islamist militants from either al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) or the Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (Mujao). No group has claimed responsibility for the attack. There are 200 French troops and 200 UN peacekeepers as well as a Malian army base in Kidal. RFI said Mr Verlon and Ms Dupont were on their second assignment there, having travelled to the town in July to cover the first round of the presidential election. Ambeiry Ag Rhissa, a local official of the MNLA ethnic Tuareg separatist group, said the pair had just left his house after interviewing him when they were kidnapped. He said he did not see how many kidnappers were there, but other sources said four men forced the journalists into a beige truck which was then driven off into the surrounding desert. France led an operation to oust Islamist rebels from northern Mali - its former colony - earlier this year, sending in thousands of troops. It handed over responsibility for security to a UN force in the summer. But French troops are still in the country helping to prevent a resurgence of militant activity in the region. </body>

      <body>A robot developed by Japanese scientists is so fast it can "win" the rock-paper-scissors game against a human every single time. The Janken robot - named after the game's Japanese name - is a faster version of one unveiled by University of Tokyo researchers in June 2012. Version two completes its chosen hand shape almost at the same time as the human hand. It uses high-speed recognition and reaction, rather than prediction. Technically, the robot cheats because it reacts extremely quickly to what the human hand is doing rather than making a premeditated simultaneous action as the rules state. Taking just one millisecond (ms) - a thousandth of a second - to recognise what shape the human hand is making, it then chooses a winning move and reacts at high speed. Version one completed its shape 20ms after the human hand; version two finishes almost simultaneously. The scientists at the Ishikawa Oku Laboratory, part of the University of Tokyo, specialise in a range of technologies, including "sensor fusion", which aims to replicate and improve upon the human senses using high-speed intelligent robots. But Sethu Vijayakumar, professor of robotics at Edinburgh University, told the BBC: "These robots are really fast at reaction, but there are scenarios where even a millisecond's delay is not acceptable, such as accident avoidance or virtual stock markets. "In these cases we need to combine high-speed reaction with high-speed prediction, using game theory and behaviour patterning." </body>

      <title>US eyes Virginia governor race</title>
      <description>The two leading candidates to be Virginia governor are on their last day of campaigning, in a race that is being closely watched nationwide.</description>

      <body>The two leading candidates to be Virginia governor are on their last day of campaigning, in a race that is being closely watched nationwide. Democrat Terry McAuliffe, a former key Clinton aide, has a solid opinion poll lead over Republican Ken Cuccinelli, who is backed by tea party activists. The candidates have traded blows on the troubled Obama healthcare law and the recent government shutdown. Virginia voters go to the polls on Tuesday. Long a Republican stronghold, Virginia has been reshaped demographically in recent years in a trend mirrored across the nation. The outgoing governor, Bob McDonnell, is a Republican, but Democratic President Barack Obama won the state in the 2008 and 2012 White House elections. On Monday, Vice-President Joe Biden joined Mr McAuliffe on the campaign trail near the Washington DC suburbs. The state's northern section abuts the US capital city, making it an easy trip for politicians. On Sunday, the candidate was joined by Mr Obama, who told a Virginia crowd: "This election is going to say a lot about Virginia's future and about the country's future." Mr McAuliffe was co-chairman of former President Bill Clinton's re-election campaign and chairman of Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign. Both have also made campaign appearances on his behalf. Mr Cuccinelli was joined in Monday's last-minute dash for votes by Republican Senator Marco Rubio. Mr McAuliffe, who appears to have a comfortable lead in the race, has characterised his opponent as part of a tea party-backed wave of ideologue conservative politicians. The Democrats have ridiculed Mr Cuccinelli's efforts to reinstate a Virginia statute that banned sodomy. On Monday, Mr Biden told supporters that if Mr Cuccinelli, the current Virginia attorney general, wins the election, the state would have to offer subsidies to firms to locate there because of his policies on women's healthcare and gay rights. Democrats have also attempted to tie the Republican candidate to last month's Republican-led federal government shutdown. Mr Cuccinelli has meanwhile sought to link Mr McAuliffe to the healthcare law, which is facing a backlash over the glitches plaguing its website selling insurance policies, and complaints from a number of Americans that they are now facing more costly premiums. The Democratic candidate has vowed that under his governorship Virginia would embrace the healthcare law, commonly known as Obamacare. During a campaign stop on Sunday, Mr Cuccinelli said: "I'm scared to death about what Obamacare is doing to Virginians. Terry McAuliffe is scared to death what Obamacare is doing to Terry McAuliffe. Tomorrow, we need to have his fears fulfilled." Mr Cuccinelli has also argued against stricter gun control efforts and coal regulations. Virginia is among several states involved in the US coal industry. </body>

      <title>Kerry: US-Saudi ties are enduring</title>
      <description>US Secretary of State John Kerry, in Saudi Arabia on the second stop of his regional tour, says ties between the two nations are strategic and enduring.</description>

      <body>US Secretary of State John Kerry, visiting Saudi Arabia, has said ties between the two nations are "strategic" and "enduring". There were "no differences" between them on Syria, Mr Kerry said. US ties with its long-standing ally have been frayed by the Syrian conflict and recent US policy on Iran. Speaking at a joint news conference with Mr Kerry, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal also played down recent tensions. The prince described the two nations as "friendly countries" with a relationship based on "sincerity, candour and frankness," according to Associated Press. Saudi Arabia is an important diplomatic and trading partner for the US. The kingdom is reportedly unhappy that peace talks over Syria could lead to an Iran-backed government in Damascus. Riyadh is also concerned about a US-Iran rapprochement as they try to resolve the dispute over Tehran's nuclear programme. Mr Kerry is in the Saudi capital as part of a regional tour. He described Saudi Arabia as the "senior player" in the Arab world, along with Egypt. He first made an unscheduled stop in Egypt, where he called for an end to violence and a move to full democracy. Mr Kerry also said the US was committed to working with Egypt's new rulers. Egypt is one of the issues that have caused tension between Saudi Arabia and the United States in recent months. Washington froze some of the $1.3bn (£810m) it gives in aid annually to Egypt when the democratically elected president Mohammed Morsi was ousted by the army earlier this year. Saudi Arabia has thrown its support behind the new military-backed government. It had earlier been widely reported that the Saudi intelligence chief, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, had told European diplomats his country would be making "a major shift" in its relations with the US. Speaking in Cairo before he flew to to Riyadh, Mr Kerry said he would not allow countries like Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt to be "attacked from the outside" - a message which was viewed by some as a veiled reference to Iran. He also stressed the need for Egypt to move toward democracy. "History has demonstrated that democracies are more stable, viable and prosperous than any alternative," he told a news conference. "With stability comes tourism and investment, and with both come jobs." His visit to Cairo was not disclosed by US officials until he landed. It is the first time a US secretary of state has travelled to Egypt on a visit that is unannounced for security reasons. The BBC's Kim Ghattas, travelling with Mr Kerry, says it is the kind of precaution that characterises trips by US officials to countries like Afghanistan and Iraq. This is a sign of US concerns about continued instability in the country, but it is also a reaction to the high level of anti-American feeling in Egypt, our correspondent says. Mr Kerry said Egypt's fortunes, and its bilateral relations, depended on its democratic transition. He said that the US was "committed to work with" the interim government. Mr Kerry's nine-day trip will take in a number of countries in the region and in Europe, including the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Morocco, Jordan and Poland. The secretary of state will also meet Israeli and Palestinian leaders to discuss the peace process in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. Correspondents say Mr Kerry may have to face difficult questions over allegations of widespread US spying. In the wake of revelations sparked by leaks from ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, Mr Kerry said last week that spying by the US National Security Agency may have gone too far. </body>

      <title>Thirteen killed in Mexico shoot-outs</title>

      <body>Thirteen people were killed on Sunday in gun battles in the northern Mexican city of Matamoros in Tamaulipas state, officials say. Twelve men and one woman were shot dead in three separate clashes. In two of the incidents, Mexican marines clashed with armed men, while in the third suspected members of rival gangs opened fire on each other. Matamoros is on the US-Mexico border in an area disputed by the Gulf and Zetas drug cartels. Four men and one woman were killed in the first shoot-out between two rival groups on the main highway leading from Matamoros to the city of Reynosa. The second gun battle happened just hours later on the same highway, when members of the Mexican marine force gave chase to an armed group and killed four of them. Four more men were killed in central Matamoros after they opened fire on marines, officials said. Local media said the weapons and munitions found at the scenes of the shoot-outs suggested they belonged to organised crime groups. The Zetas and the Gulf cartels have battled for years to control the lucrative smuggling routes through Matamoros, which is across the border from Brownsville, Texas. Mexican forces in July and August captured the head of the Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, and the head of the Gulf Cartel, Mario Ramirez Trevino. Analysts had predicted a rise in violence as cartel members tried to fill the vacuum left by their leaders. More than 77,000 people are estimated to have been killed in drug violence in Mexico since the then-president, Felipe Calderon, launched a war against the cartels in late 2006. </body>

      <body>The Colombian navy has seized 1,450 kg (3,200 lb) of cocaine from a speedboat in the Caribbean, following a tip off by US anti-drugs agents. Colombian officials say the boat had left the northern town of Manaure and was heading towards the Dominican Republic. It was intercepted in international waters Four Venezuelans and a Colombian have been detained and are being held in custody in Tampa, Florida. They are expected to be charged with drug trafficking, Colombian police said. The drugs allegedly belonged to Los Urabenos, which operates in northern Colombia. Los Urabenos is one of the groups the Colombian government calls Bacrim, short for bandas criminales (criminal gangs). Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos has made the fight against the Bacrim one of his government's priorities. Speedboats are used by gangs trying to avoid surveillance as they transport illegal drugs produced in South America to Central America, Mexico and the United States. In two joint operations last month, agents from the US, Colombia, Panama and the Dominican Republican seized 2,500 kg of cocaine in the region. </body>

      <title>May defends terror control system</title>
      <description>Home Secretary Theresa May insists the system for dealing with terror suspects is "strong and sustainable" despite a suspect escaping surveillance disguised in a burka.</description>

      <body>The home secretary has insisted the system for dealing with terror suspects is "strong and sustainable". It comes after a suspect, who was subject to an order restricting his movements, absconded from a London mosque disguised as a woman in a burka. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, is the second suspect under a so-called TPim order to go missing in under a year. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said changes to controls on suspects had made it easier for them to vanish. Somali-born Mr Mohamed entered the mosque in Acton, west London, in western-style clothes, but was seen on CCTV leaving with his face and body fully covered by a burka. It follows the disappearance of Ibrahim Magag in December, who absconded in a black cab after ripping off his electronic tag. Mr Mohamed, who has been linked to the Somali militant group al-Shabab, was subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPim) notice, which is aimed at protecting the public from people the home secretary believes to have engaged in terrorism-related activity but who it is not deemed feasible to prosecute or deport. Theresa May told MPs: "Even if we wanted to go back to the days of control orders, we would not be able to do so. "The powers available under control orders were being steadily eroded by the courts and the system was becoming unviable. Unlike control orders, TPims have been upheld consistently by the courts so we now have a strong and sustainable legal framework to handle terror suspects. "The police and the security services have always said that there has been no substantial risk since the introduction of TPims." Ms Cooper said the home secretary had made it easier for serious terror suspects to disappear, which was "irresponsible". "She was warned about changing the law, she was warned about weakening controls, she was warned more people would abscond and they have - twice -but still she won't act. The question on everyone's lips is how many more warnings does this home secretary need?," she said. Mrs May said Mr Mohamed's tag was thought to have be working correctly: "I have been advised that this abscond has not raised any new operational issues with the tags." Prime Minister David Cameron said TPims "do work" but when there was a problem the government needed to "act very, very quickly and get on top of it and we will". BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said what was extraordinary was that Theresa May had been entirely un-contrite about what had happened, insisting there was not going to be a return to control orders. He added that what was even more striking was the lack of a backlash from her own backbenchers. Mr Mohamed, 27, arrived at the An-Noor Masjid and Community Centre, in Church Road, Acton, at approximately 10:00 GMT on Friday, and was seen inside at 15:15 GMT. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The Counter Terrorism Command immediately launched inquiries to trace Mr Mohamed and these continue. "Ports and borders were notified with his photograph and details circulated nationally. Public safety remains our priority." Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile, the former reviewer of anti-terror laws, said: "We were assured by the government that extra money would be spent on surveillance to ensure that exactly this kind of event did not occur. "Yet the person concerned was able to walk in the front door of a mosque as a man and out through another door as a woman, on CCTV which was not seen, apparently, by the authorities." The court-approved TPim orders include a requirement that their subjects report daily to the authorities, stay overnight at a specified address, wear a GPS tag, and face restrictions on travel, movement, association and communication. They were introduced in January 2012 to replace control orders, which had been in place for seven years and also included the power to relocate suspects. When the TPims order was obtained, Mr Mohamed was said to have received terrorist training in Somalia and fought on the front line in support of al-Shabab. Court documents also say he supported a UK-based network supporting terrorist-related activity in Somalia and had been involved in attack planning against Western interests in east Africa. A spokesman for the mosque in Acton said: "The recent incident bears no semblance to the work we do as an organisation for the development of the community at large." </body>

      <description>A rare solar eclipse sweeps parts of North America, Europe and Africa, allowing a view of the Sun totally or partially blocked out by the Moon.</description>

      <body>A rare solar eclipse allowing a view of the Sun that is totally or partially blocked by the Moon has taken place. It was first visible in the southern United States, before sweeping east across the Atlantic Ocean and the African continent. The US space agency, Nasa, said the greatest total eclipse occurred over the Atlantic Ocean. One of the best views was in northern Kenya, where tour companies organised trips to view a total blackout. Local myths there attribute the event to the Moon eating the Sun. Partial views were available in eastern North America and southern Europe. This solar eclipse was a rare occurrence in that it was "hybrid" - switching between an annular and total eclipse. In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the sun, while an annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is at its farthest from the Earth and does not block out the Sun completely, leaving a halo of sunlight still visible around the Moon. The eclipse event began about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Jacksonville, Florida with an annular eclipse visible for four seconds at sunrise. As the Moon's shadow raced east the eclipse switched from annular to total along a narrow corridor. The greatest total eclipse occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 330km south-west of Liberia, and lasted for more than one minute. The eclipse continued across Africa through the Congos until it passed through northern Uganda and northern Kenya, ending in southern Ethiopia and Somalia. Either side, a partial eclipse was seen within a much broader path including eastern North America, northern South America, southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Experts warned that no-one should attempt to view the Sun with the naked eye. A safe view of eclipses can be obtained by using special welder's glasses or a pinhole camera. </body>

      <title>S Korea's Park highlights Japan rift</title>
      <description>South Korea's president tells the BBC there is "no purpose" to talks with Japan, even as the region struggles to rein in North Korea's nuclear capability.</description>

      <body>South Korea's president has highlighted a deep rift with Japan, as the region struggles to rein in North Korea's growing nuclear capability. President Park Geun-hye told the BBC she saw no point in a summit with the Japanese leader unless the country apologised for war-time "wrongdoings". Concern over regional security has grown in the past year, following North Korea's third nuclear test in February. Ms Park said nations had to break the "vicious cycle" of Pyongyang's actions. She said her country would take "firm and unremitting action" in response to any military provocation from North Korea. The South Korean president was speaking to the BBC ahead of a visit to the UK, which begins this week. Park Geun-hye took office in February with a promise to revamp the Korean economy and enact a "trust-building" process with the North. Her government reached an early agreement with Pyongyang to reopen a jointly-run industrial park at Kaesong, but further agreements - including a plan to reunite families separated by the Korean War - have not been honoured by the North. And as signs of Pyongyang's commitment to its nuclear and missile programmes continue, there are calls from some countries to reopen talks. In an interview before leaving for Europe, Ms Park said the familiar pattern of dealing with the leadership there must be broken: "We cannot repeat the vicious cycle of the past where North Korea's nuclear threats and provocations were met with rewards and coddling, and then followed by renewed provocations and threats," she said. "We must sever that vicious cycle… otherwise North Korea will continue to advance its nuclear capability and we will come to a point where this situation will be even harder to crack; where we won't be talking about whether North Korea should or should not possess nuclear weapons, but where… they will be calling for arms reductions, or arms talks." Over the past three years, North Korea has carried out a nuclear test; launched a long-range rocket; restarted a nuclear reactor at Yongybyon; and shelled a South Korean island, killing four people, including civilians. It is also blamed by Seoul for sinking a South Korean warship with 46 sailors on board. North Korea's actions have gradually brought its friends and enemies closer together. UN sanctions on Pyongyang were agreed this year by both China and the US, and Ms Park was greeted warmly and with fanfare when she visited Beijing in June. "China is a very close neighbour" she said, "and we are currently carrying out various programmes to give greater substance to that partnership." All of which makes South Korea's current relationship with Japan all the more striking. Eight months after taking office, Ms Park has still not met her neighbour and fellow US ally, and talk of a summit, she said, was still premature. "The fact is there are certain issues that complicate [that relationship]" she said. "One example is the issue of the comfort women. These are women who have spent their blossoming years in hardship and suffering, and spent the rest of their life in ruins." "And none of these cases have been resolved or addressed; the Japanese have not changed any of their positions with regard to this. If Japan continues to stick to the same historical perceptions and repeat its past comments, then what purpose would a summit serve? Perhaps it would be better not to have one." Japan's war-time use of military sex slaves, or "comfort women", draws great public anger here, as does its claim over the rocky islet of Dokdo (known as Takeshima in Japan), which lies in the waters between the two nations. Tokyo's new assertiveness on these kinds of issues is causing ripples with others in the region too, and with North Korea edging ever-closer to a deliverable nuclear weapons, regional co-operation - or lack of it - could carry real consequences. </body>

      <title>Musharraf step closer to release</title>
      <description>Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf wins bail in the last legal case against him, bringing him a step closer to release from house arrest.</description>

      <body>A Pakistani court has granted bail to former military ruler Pervez Musharraf over the 2007 army operation to oust militants from Islamabad's Red Mosque. The court approved bail on condition Mr Musharraf pay bonds totalling $2,000. BBC correspondents say he has now been bailed in all the cases against him, which makes it likely he will be released from house arrest. But the former general remains on a government exit control list and cannot leave the country. Speaking outside the court in the capital, his lawyer said Mr Musharraf had no intention of leaving Pakistan. The operation ordered by Gen Musharraf on the besieged Red Mosque left a cleric and more than 100 others dead, and fuelled a deadly militant insurgency inside Pakistan which rages to this day. Earlier this year, he returned to Pakistan from self-imposed exile to fight elections - which were won by Nawaz Sharif, the man he ousted in his 1999 coup - but swiftly ran into trouble. He was barred from running in the general election, and was placed under house arrest in April in the first of a series of cases relating to his time in power from 1999-2008. He faces murder trials over the assassination of former PM Benazir Bhutto and Baloch tribal leader Nawab Akbar Bugti. He has also been charged over his attempt to sack the higher judiciary in 2007. Mr Musharraf has been bailed in all three of those cases. Separately, the Sharif government said in June that it planned to try him for treason - but a formal complaint in that case has still to be lodged. Mr Musharraf insists all the charges against him are politically motivated. His house arrest is unprecedented in a country which has been ruled by the military for more than half of its history. The latest bail ruling means Mr Musharraf could soon be free to move around Pakistan. But he is likely to remain under guard at his villa on the outskirts of Islamabad because of threats to his life. </body>

      <body>A British expert on art looted by the Nazis says the hoard of 1,500 artworks found in Munich is just "the tip of the iceberg" and most works acquired by the Nazis are still untraced. The Munich trove is believed to include works by Matisse, Picasso and Chagall, the news magazine Focus reports. The total value is estimated at about one billion euros (£846m; $1.35bn). Anne Webber of the Commission for Looted Art in Europe said about 90% of Nazi-looted art is still missing. In Western Europe during World War Two, the Nazis often used devalued currency to acquire important artworks cheaply in occupied countries, though in Eastern Europe they carried out large-scale looting. The Munich works are thought to be among the many which the Nazis either seized from Jews or removed from galleries as "degenerate" modern art. The magazine said the artworks were found by chance when the tax authorities investigated Cornelius Gurlitt, the reclusive son of an art dealer in Munich. He was suspected of tax evasion, and investigators obtained a search warrant for his apartment in Munich in early 2011. There, they found the cache of some 1,500 artworks which had vanished from sight during the Nazi era. The younger Mr Gurlitt had kept the works in darkened rooms, surrounded by clutter, and sold the occasional painting when he needed money, Focus reports. They have been kept in a secure wing of Bavarian customs while experts try to find out who they belonged to, the magazine says. The Bavarian customs authorities and prosecutors will give a news conference about the discovery at 10:00 (09:00 GMT) on Tuesday, at the state prosecutor's office in Augsburg, a customs official told the BBC. Speaking to BBC News, Ms Webber said the German authorities were generally slow to trace the origins of artworks, despite the efforts of hundreds of families to trace their valuable property. "The Bavarian authorities didn't publish a list... it's very important that the Bavarian government take immediate steps now to say when they are going to publish and when they will return works to their rightful owners," she said. Ms Webber runs a registry of artworks that were held in Nazi collections during 1933-1945. The laundering of art from Nazi collections is "very much the unknown and unwritten history" of post-war Germany, she said. "There was a network of dealers in Bavaria after the war who had large amounts of Nazi-looted art that they were laundering and they still come up for sale at auction in Germany," she added. There are international warrants out for at least 200 of the Munich works, Focus reports. One of the pieces is said to be a portrait of a woman by Matisse which belonged to the grandfather of French TV presenter Anne Sinclair. Paul Rosenberg, an art dealer who represented Picasso as well as Matisse, was forced to leave his collection behind when he fled France in 1940. The US Holocaust Memorial Museum estimates the Nazis seized about 16,000 works of art in all. </body>

      <description>French police release a sketch of a motorcyclist wanted in connection with the murders of four people in the Alps last year.</description>

      <body>French police have released a sketch of a motorcyclist wanted in connection with the murders of four people in the Alps last year. Three members of a British-Iraqi family and a French cyclist were shot on 5 September near Lake Annecy. Investigators say eyewitnesses saw the motorcyclist on the road leading to the murder scene. The artist's impression shows him wearing a goatee and a rare type of helmet that opens from the side. Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf were shot along with cyclist Sylvain Mollier on a remote forest road in Chevaline. The family's two young daughters survived the attack, one by hiding under her dead mother's skirt. Police say the helmet the motorcyclist was wearing is of particular interest as only 8,000 were made in the black or dark colour described by witnesses. It is a full-face model that opens from the side to allow for conversations, without the rider having to remove the helmet. "The only helmet on the market that matches this description is the ISR-type GPA helmet," police said in a statement. Despite checking with distributors, police have been unable to trace the owner. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says witnesses gave a description of the motorcyclist to police in the early stages of their investigation, but the artist's impression was not released for fear the suspect would go into hiding. "This is someone who was close to the scene during a time period that interests us," a spokesman for the investigation said. Brett Martin, a British cyclist who discovered the attack, told the BBC's Panorama programme he saw a motorcyclist leaving the scene of the shooting. "He was going at a very slow, abnormally slow speed, and at the time it seemed odd," he said. A forestry worker coming down from a nearby mountain just minutes before the shooting also spoke to the programme. He said: "When I arrived, there was a motorbike pulling in to the parking area. I passed the parking and the motorbike was on the left here. "I remember it well, it was white, white and black, with panniers on either side. "The rider was all in black [and] his visor was completely closed." Police say the motorcyclist they want to speak to was on the Combre d'Ire road in Chevaline, near Annecy, between 15:15 and 15:40 local time (13:15 and 13:40 GMT) on the day of the killings. They are also looking for a right-hand drive BMW 4x4 that was spotted close to the scene. Mr al-Hilli's brother Zaid was arrested by British police in June on suspicion of planning the killings. He has protested his innocence but admits the pair had fallen out over their father's inheritance. </body>

      <body>An Israeli drone has come down in the northern Gaza Strip, with Israel denying Palestinian reports that it was shot down. The armed wing of Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, claimed it had shot down and seized the mini-drone. But the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the crash was the result of a technical fault and the matter was being investigated. Israel is among the world's biggest manufacturers of drones. They are unmanned aerial vehicles which Israel uses to gather intelligence and, sometimes, to carry out attacks. "IDF clarifies, in contradiction to Palestinian reports, that a 'Skylark' tactical mini UAV system crashed earlier today in the Gaza Strip due to a technical malfunction, and was not shot down by Palestinian militants," an IDF spokesperson told the BBC on Sunday. "The IDF is looking into the matter." But Hamas said fighters from its military wing, the Izz al-Din Qassam Brigades, had downed and seized the drone. Hamas sources told the BBC that it came down east of Jabaliya in the northern Gaza Strip. Last May, a drone of the same model crashed near Gaza, because of a technical error. Troops recovered the drone after a 12-hour search. </body>

      <body>Tunisia has been suspended from the Davis Cup tennis tournament after Tunisian player Malek Jaziri was ordered not to compete against an Israeli opponent last month. The International Tennis Federation said there was no room for prejudice in sport and the one-year ban was a "fitting penalty". Jaziri withdrew from the Tashkent Challenger last month ahead of a match against Amir Weintraub. He was cleared of wrongdoing. Officials found Jaziri - who had claimed to be suffering from a knee injury - had been ordered to pull out of the match. The ITF board voted unanimously to suspend the Tunisian Tennis Federation for one year from the Davis Cup, one of the most important tournaments in men's tennis. "There is no room for prejudice of any kind in sport or in society. The ITF Board decided to send a strong message to the Tunisian Tennis Federation that this kind of action will not be tolerated by any of our members," said ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti. </body>

      <title>Coulson 'never involved in hacking'</title>
      <description>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones", his barrister tells an Old Bailey jury.</description>

      <body>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones - whatever others might have been doing on his watch", an Old Bailey jury has heard. His barrister Timothy Langdale QC was speaking after the conclusion of the prosecution opening statement. He said Mr Coulson wished he had made some "different decisions" but "he did not commit these offences". Mr Coulson, 45, of Charing, Kent, denies conspiracy to hack phones. Mr Coulson, who also denies conspiracy to commit misconduct, left the newspaper industry in 2007 and went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director. He is among eight defendants, who all deny the range of charges against them. Making opening remarks, which he said was a "relatively uncommon" for a defence barrister, Mr Langdale said his client would be taking to the witness box later in the trial to give evidence about "the fast-moving world of Sunday tabloid journalism - a fiercely competitive world". He said Mr Coulson's job was "not to know about every story during the week", adding there were "many thousands of pieces of information, many of which never got in the paper at all". Reporters kept sources close to their chest, often protecting them from rivals on their own newspaper, Mr Langdale added. And he told the court that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who has a conviction for phone hacking for the News of the World and has admitted other phone-hacking charges, had targeted the phone of Mr Coulson. Mr Langdale said the case had "an unusual history" and "the trial itself will be unusually long". He also warned about "unfair reporting" of events, saying the Guardian newspaper had been wrong to say in July 2011 that News of the World journalists had deleted messages on the phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who went missing in 2002. There was no evidence to suggest Mr Mulcaire or any other person acting for the paper had deleted any message "deliberately or accidentally", he said. There was nothing the paper had done which gave rise to any "false hope" that Milly Dowler was still alive, he added. Later the court heard from the first witness, Det Sgt Gregory Smith, who investigated the phone hacking allegations. Jurors heard about a message from a recruitment firm left on the teenager's phone, a detail which became the subject of a News of the World story about her. Of the prosecution handling of the evidence, Mr Langdale said: "Their interpretation is wrong, their conclusions are wrong - there will be a time to reflect all that." Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC earlier told the court that notebooks went missing amid the "media firestorm" caused by the revelation that News of the World journalists had hacked Milly Dowler's phone. Those claims led to the closure of the paper in July 2011. Mr Edis said News International executive Rebekah Brooks and others hid evidence as police investigated the newspaper. He said security staff picked up a laptop and other material from Mrs Brooks's home in Oxfordshire, which was later found hidden in a bin bag near bins at her Chelsea Harbour flat. The court heard that, after it was hidden, a member of the security team sent a text to former security chief Mark Hanna that said: "Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Pizza delivered and the chicken is in the pot." Mrs Brooks, who was editor of the News of the World between 2000 and 2003, and her PA Cheryl Carter deny perverting the course of justice. Mrs Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, denies a second similar charge, along with her husband Charlie Brooks and Mr Hanna. She also denies conspiracy to intercept communications and conspiracy to commit misconduct. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>The mother of a teenage girl killed in a collision with a car outside her home said she kissed her daughter goodbye as she lay dead in the road. Jasmine Allsop, 14, was killed on Ann's Hill Road, Gosport, early on Sunday with her friend Olivia Lewry, 16. Police have been granted a further day to question a 20-year-old Gosport man on suspicion of murder. Rosemary Allsop said: "I told her she was my angel and I'd loved her since the day she was born." Speaking from her home, close to where Jasmine died, Ms Allsop, 37, described her daughter as "a gorgeous, lovely, bubbly character". "I kissed her - it was four hours before they took her body away because I did not want to let her go," she said. "I'm empty inside and lost. I keep expecting her to come through the door." Ms Allsop said she had gone to bed when the incident happened and was woken by the emergency services. "It was just all a blur," she said. "I cannot remember what happened. "I had gone to bed. I didn't see anything. I just thought they [Jasmine and Olivia] were playing CDs and talking about boys and make-up." She described the girls as "best friends". Jasmine died at the scene while Olivia was pronounced dead at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. Jasmine's father Kevin MacLaughlan, 58, also paid tribute to his daughter. He said: "I do not know how we are going to get through this. We have run out of words of comfort to say." Hampshire Police is appealing for anyone who saw the crash, near the junction of Ann's Hill Road and Brougham Street, to contact them. Officers were originally given until 19:30 GMT to question the suspect, but this has now been extended until Tuesday evening. Tributes were paid to both girls on social networking sites and friends have laid floral tributes at the scene of the crash. </body>

      <body>HSBC saw profit surge 30% in the three months to the end of September, boosted by a strong performance in the UK and Hong Kong. Reported pre-tax profit was $4.5bn (£2.8bn), compared with $3.4bn for the same period a year ago, the bank said. The bank's home markets of the UK and Hong Kong were responsible for more than half of the group's profits. HSBC also confirmed it was being investigated as part of a global probe into currency trading manipulation. Barclays, RBS, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS have already confirmed that regulators, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, have been in contact with them in relation to suggestions that currency markets could have been rigged. "We see reasons for optimism with some evidence of a broadening recovery," group chief executive Stuart Gulliver said on the outlook for the bank. Operating expenses fell by $700m to $9.6bn during the period, but the bank said that was mainly due to the absence of one-off costs from last year. Underlying costs were up on the year, which HSBC blamed on investments, wage inflation and regulatory-related costs. Mr Gulliver is aiming to streamline the bank's operations by focusing on high-growth markets in Asia. In October, it sold its Panama business for an estimated $1.1bn gain. The firm has closed or sold 12 non-core businesses since the start of the year. "Hong Kong continues to benefit from its close economic relationship with mainland China. We remain well positioned to capitalise on improving economic conditions in these markets," added Mr Gulliver. </body>

      <body>Drugs giant Johnson and Johnson has agreed to pay more than $2.2bn (£1.4bn) to settle allegations over its marketing techniques, the Justice Department has said. The firm is alleged to have paid incentives to doctors and pharmacies to promote three of its medicines. These included anti-psychotic drugs Risperdal and Invega, as well as heart drug Natrecor. The firm also allegedly promoted the drugs for uses not officially allowed. While US doctors can prescribe medicines as they see fit, pharmaceutical companies cannot advocate any use of their drugs that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is the third biggest settlement involving a drugs firm in US history. It is intended to resolve both civil and criminal allegations involving the drugs at both state and federal level across the US. </body>

      <title>Business not 'the enemy', CBI says</title>

      <body>Business is suffering a crisis in public confidence, the president of the CBI employers' group has said. Sir Mike Rake told the organisation's annual conference in London that business was seen by some people as the "enemy". But the truth was that the UK would only thrive with successful, productive businesses of all sizes, he said. "We want to be, we can be, and we are partners in building prosperity," he said. "Some of the rhetoric we've heard recently suggests that business is somehow the enemy - we are not, and this could not be further from the truth. "Business is undoubtedly suffering a crisis in public confidence - as we have seen in banking, and now in the current debate around energy." Recent prices rise by energy suppliers sparked calls for price controls, windfall taxes, and an investigation into whether the market was working efficiently. But Sir Mike, chairman of BT, said "over simplistic" statements just played to the public gallery. "But they will not address the complex problems that need to be resolved - indeed, they are very likely to have the opposite effect." Transforming the energy market will be costly, he warned, adding: "The obvious issue is how to balance long-term investment with the short-term pressures on household budgets. "People are of course concerned about rising prices. They feel, rightly or wrongly, that they're being unfairly treated. "There are no easy answers, but the public deserves better than politicians playing the blame game," he said. The CBI president criticised the "commercially harmful" indecision over HS2 and urged politicians to stick to long-term infrastructure decisions. "Vision and implementation are the answers to many of the UK's perennial challenges on transport: Road, rail and air, and energy. A co-ordinated plan for making this happen is essential," he said. The delivery of some big projects on the ground "is just not happening", he warned. "Political indecision is commercially harmful - delivery has got to be ramped up." </body>

      <title>Change head injury rules, urge unions</title>
      <description>Footballers should be removed from the field of play if they lose consciousness, say two of football's player unions.</description>

      <body>Footballers should be removed from play if they lose consciousness, say the world players' union Fifpro and the Professional Footballers' Association. Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris was allowed to carry on after being knocked out in Sunday's 0-0 draw with Everton. "If anyone suffers severe trauma to the head and loses consciousness, they should be required to leave the field," said the PFA's John Bramall. The Football Association says a player can continue if assessed by a doctor. Lloris briefly lost consciousness after colliding with striker Romelu Lukaku late on in the match at Goodison Park and was assessed on the pitch before continuing. Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas said he believed Lloris looked capable of continuing and the French international later underwent a CT scan, showing no signs of concussion. "This decision is unacceptable," said Fifpro medical advisor Vincent Gouttebarge. "Fifpro condemns that the health and safety of players are left to coaches, trainers or even to players themselves. "Medical professionals should be aware of any relevant medical guidelines and apply them in order to empower the health and safety on the field." Fifpro urged all clubs to follow guidelines laid out by sport medicine groups in Zurich last year, which called for the removal of a player from the field if they were showing a loss of consciousness. Fifa's chief medical officer, Professor Jiri Dvorak, also said Lloris should have been substituted, in accordance with the world governing body's guidelines. "The decision was not right," added Dvorak. "We have a very clear recommendation for doctors if concussion occurs or even if there is a strong suspicion of concussion then the player should be taken out of the play. "This injury could have led to more severe complications." Bramall added: "It is important to take the pressure off the players, club medical staff, and the manager - removing the need for them to make a very difficult decision. "The PFA will continue to work with the stakeholders within the game, to evaluate what guidelines are currently in place and to see if and how they need to be improved." In rugby union, Dr Barry O'Driscoll resigned from his role as medical advisor to the International Rugby Board in October following concerns about the treatment of concussion. </body>

      <body>Zak Hardaker has withdrawn from England's Rugby League World Cup squad because of "personal issues". The Leeds Rhinos full-back, 22, is the second player to exit Steve McNamara's squad after Salford's Gareth Hock was thrown out for disciplinary reasons. Hardaker was not chosen for either of England's first two tournament matches. An England Rugby League statement read: "Due to personal issues, Zak Hardaker is unable to commit to the England Rugby League programme." It continued: "He has informed the England RL management team that he wishes to withdraw from the squad and will not play any further part in Rugby League World Cup 2013. No replacement has been called up. "England Rugby League will work with Zak's club, Leeds Rhinos, to support him during this period." McNamara cited illness as the reason for Hardaker's absence on Saturday. When asked if he was being punished for a breach of discipline, McNamara said: "Absolutely not." Former Leeds, Great Britain and England player Keith Senior told BBC Look North that it was a "massive disappointment" for Hardaker that he was no longer involved in the World Cup. "Hopefully he will get through his troubles because he has great potential and he has a very big future," added 37-year-old Senior. Second-rower Hock confirmed his own removal came after he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy before oversleeping the next morning and missing a recovery session. Former captain James Graham was also left out of England's squad for their opening match against Australia, with McNamara walking out of a pre-match media conference when asked by journalists about the player's absence. </body>

      <description>Stanislas Wawrinka claims a three-set victory over Tomas Berdych in the opening match of the ATP World Tour Finals.</description>

      <body>Stanislas Wawrinka claimed a three-set victory over Tomas Berdych in the opening match of the ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in London. Impressive serving helped the Swiss take the first set, but a resurgent Berdych capitalised on Wawrinka's errors in the second-set tie-break. However, Wawrinka turned on the style in the decider for a 6-3 6-7 (0-7) 6-3 victory in two hours and 25 minutes. Juan Martin Del Potro plays Richard Gasquet later on Monday. Victory gives Wawrinka - who had not before qualified for the World Tour Finals - an early advantage in Group A, which also includes Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, who play on Tuesday. "It was a dream come true to win on my debut here," the world number eight told BBC Sport. "I have watched many times on TV and today I was here on court. I'm happy to get the win. It's never easy on your first time here but I'm happy with way I played today. "It's only one match - I take it match after match. I know how I can play and now I'll get ready for the next one." Wawrinka, who beat Andy Murray en route to the semi-finals of the US Open in September, looked immediately at home on his debut at the O2 Arena, dropping only one point in his opening three service games. He forced a break in the sixth game of the match and, after a wobble when serving for the set, eventually grasped a fifth opportunity. Berdych, the world number six, improved in the second set but still could not find a way past Wawrinka, the Czech wasting four break points. In the tie-break, though, rare Wawrinka errors opened the door for Berdych and the 2010 Wimbledon finalist raced through 7-0 to send the contest into a third set. But Wawrinka was not to be denied and, after a Berdych double fault gifted away a break point, a further mistake gave the Swiss the advantage. Now oozing confidence, best demonstrated by the deftest of drop shots from the baseline, Wawrinka eased through the decider and served out for victory. "Losing is not a good start but there are still two other matches to go," said Berdych. "It was really about the small chances - Stan was better in executing the chances. "He had four break points and made two; I had five, made zero. I think that's been a really big difference today." The Del Potro-Gasquet contest is in Group B, where they are joined by Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. </body>

      <body>Sci-fi adventure Ender's Game has zoomed to the top of the US box office chart in its debut weekend. Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, about an 86-year-old and his eight-year-old grandson, was shunted into second after hitting the number one spot last week. Ender's Game, a story about children forced to fight an enemy race, took $28m (£17.5m) according to estimates. The film stars Harrison Ford as a commander who manipulates a young boy (Asa Butterfield) into leading a war. Double Oscar nominee Viola Davis plays Ford's second in command. Based on the best-selling 1985 novel of the same name, Ender's Game was in line with box office forecasts which predicted it would take between $25m (£15.6m) and $30m (£18.8m) in its opening weekend. This was despite calls by some to boycott the film after the book's author, Orson Scott Card, made some comments expressing his opposition to gay marriage. But with the highly anticipated Thor: The Dark World opening next week, box office analyst Jeff Bock said: "It looks like Ender's Game is one-and-done... (next weekend) there won't be much of the box office pie left for Ender's Game." Last Vegas, featuring an all-star cast including Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline, opened in third place with $16.5m (£10.3m). Rentrak's Paul Dergarabedian said: "It's interesting to see the number of stars that are not in their 20s in the top films. "Ender's Game has Harrison Ford and Viola Davis, and Last Vegas is like a Hangover for the older crowd. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney - in Gravity - appeal to an older audience, and 12 Years a Slave... is a very sophisticated drama." Children's animation Free Birds, which features the voices of Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson and Amy Poehler, debuted in fourth spot with takings of $16.2m (£10.1m). Gravity, now in its fifth week, rounded out the top five. Thor: The Dark World, which opened in the UK last Wednesday, beat all contenders at the UK and Ireland box office this weekend, earning £8.65m in its first five days in cinemas. Even without previews it was the comfortable victor, taking £5.54m between Friday and Sunday according to Screen International. According to its distributor Walt Disney, its weekend takings exceeded the entire first week box office of the first Thor in April 2011. Last week's top film, animated sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, fell to second place with a second weekend tally of £2.1m. </body>

      <body>Marcia Wallace, the late actress who provided the voice of schoolteacher Edna Krabappel in The Simpsons, has been remembered in its latest episode. Sunday's edition of the series began with Bart Simpson at the blackboard, standing beneath the poignant message: "We'll really miss you Mrs. K." Wallace died of complications from pneumonia on 25 October at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 70. The actress won an Emmy in 1992 for her work on the long-running animated show. Sunday's edition of The Simpsons was preceded on the Fox channel in the US by a re-run of 2011 episode The Ned-liest Catch. Wallace appeared in 178 episodes in all, voicing grumpy fourth-grade teacher Edna in all but three of them. The actress's death was confirmed on 26 October by The Simpsons' executive producer Al Jean, who said she had been "brilliant and gracious". "She was beloved by all at The Simpsons and we intend to retire her irreplaceable character," he said in a message on Facebook. </body>

      <title>No investigation for Downton rape</title>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to take no action against Downton Abbey over its contentious rape storyline, despite receiving 244 complaints from viewers. The regulator said it had decided not to pursue the complaints "after careful assessment... because they did not raise issues warranting investigation." Some viewers complained to ITV about the storyline, which saw housemaid Anna attacked and raped by a guest's valet. The broadcaster received 200 complaints after the show was aired on 6 October. A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes was broadcast before the episode, which was seen by an audience of almost 12 million. An Ofcom spokesperson said the warning had been into account, as well as the fact that the controversial scene was broadcast after the 9pm watershed. The fact that the attack itself took place off-screen also played a part in the regulator's decision. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended the storyline and its treatment, insisting it was neither gratuitous nor sensationalist. "Downton deals in subjecting a couple of characters per series to a very difficult situation and you get the emotions that come out of these traumas," he told the BBC. Joanne Froggatt, who plays Anna May Bates, has also defended the plotline, saying she was "proud" the show could tackle such a weighty subject. The fourth series of Downton Abbey reaches its conclusion on Sunday. </body>

      <title>The unfinished art business of World War Two</title>
      <description>What Munich trove reveals about Nazi art collection</description>

      <body>The astonishing find in a Munich flat of 1,500 paintings missing since 1939 points to two art crimes. The first is Adolf Hitler's crusade to fill his Fuehrermuseum at Linz, Austria, with the supreme paintings of the world - looted, confiscated and purchased by the Nazis in the occupied countries of France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Russia. The second is the crime of covering up the truth ever since. Cornelius Gurlitt, 80, whose hoard of paintings in Munich was allegedly hidden behind a wall of ancient cans of food, has kept his secrets for 68 years. What they tell us about Hitler is more important than what they reveal about Gurlitt. His pictures descend from his father, Hildebrand, one of four senior Modern Art dealers in Germany who were appointed in March 1938 to the Nazis' Confiscation Committee - with orders from Hitler and Herrmann Goering to sell "degenerate art" (entartete Kunst) for foreign currency. Hildebrand Gurlitt, Karl Buchholz, Ferdinand Moeller and Bernhard Boehmer set up shop in Schloss Niederschonhausen, just outside Berlin, to sell the near-16,000 cache of paintings and sculptures which Hitler and Goering removed from the walls of German museums in 1937-38. They were first put on display in the Haus der Kunst in Munich on 19 July 1937, with the Nazi leaders inviting public mockery by two million visitors. Propagandist Joseph Goebbels in a radio broadcast called Germany's degenerate artists "garbage". Hitler opened the Haus der Kunst exhibition with a speech, at the end of which saliva fell out of his mouth in rage. In it he described German art as suffering "a great and fatal illness". Hildebrand Gurlitt and his colleagues did not have much success with their sales, mainly because art labelled "rubbish" had small appeal. So on 20 March 1939 they set fire to 1,004 paintings and sculptures and 3,825 watercolours, drawings and prints in the courtyard of the Berlin Fire Department. The propaganda act raised the attention they hoped. The Basel Museum in Switzerland arrived with 50,000 Swiss francs to spend. Shocked art lovers came to buy. What is unknown after these sales is how many paintings were kept by Gurlitt, Buchholz, Moeller and Boehmer and sold by them to Switzerland and America - ships crossed the Atlantic from Lisbon - for personal gain. Gurlitt was arrested by the Allies near Bamberg in 1945, hiding in the castle of Baron von Pollnitz. He turned down an offer from the baron to hide his art collection in a new secret place. Or so he let a writer know. What we now know is that he did successfully hide more than 1,000 paintings - or his teenage son did. It is possible they were cached in France. Gurlitt's chief job on the Confiscation Committee was to work in Paris during the war, where he lived from 1941 to 1945 in the Hotel de Jersey. He had two ways of collecting for Hitler's Fuehrermuseum. One was to visit abandoned Jewish homes and remove their artworks; his licence was a Nazi law declaring that French nationals who had fled had lost French citizenship. The other was to spend Reichsmarks at the Drouot auction house in Paris, where distress sales were big business. Gurlitt was no small buyer. He paid more than one million French francs for the four most expensive paintings in the highest-value Paris sale of the war - the Georges Viau Impressionists auctioned by Etienne Ader between 11 and 14 December 1942, which fetched £922,000 in wartime values. The sale's top price of 5m francs was paid by Gurlitt for Cezanne's Vallee de l'Arc et Mont Sainte Victoire. It demonstrated Nazi purchasing power. Unfortunately the tiny painting, for which Gurlitt gave 94 times the then record for a Cezanne, proved to be a fake. So what was stored in his son's Munich flat? It is highly likely that pictures acquired in France are foremost and it is French families who will emerge to make claims for them. But there must also be German museum confiscations of Picasso and Matisse and paintings taken from Jewish owners in both Germany and Austria. Gurlitt would have intimately known their value. The top price for Matisse reached £2,600 at auction in 1941, that for Picasso was £880 (paid for a Blue Period Blind Man by the Toledo Museum in Ohio). Gurlitt did not set fire to these nor hand them over. He kept them for himself. Art is the last unfinished business of World War Two. Though the Allies uncovered large numbers of stolen paintings in 1945 in the Alt Aussee salt mines near Salzburg, and in a castle south of Munich, an unknown number have been lost forever. Russia holds more than 120,000 wartime art objects in three museums round Moscow. In many cases, the quality of vanished art was the highest. An important Raphael - Portrait of A Young Man - taken from Catholic owners in Poland heads a list of missing art which amounts to a small National Gallery: paintings by Rubens, Van Dyck and Rembrandt to the fore. Five years ago Austria revealed the existence of more than 10,000 paintings and sculptures, hidden since 1945 in monasteries along the Danube and in state institutions. Their Jewish owners had not been traced; how hard the Austrian government had tried to trace them was not made clear. An Austrian list exists on the internet for descendants of the original owners to come forward - if, that is, they can prove the ownership of Jews in concentration camps, or who fled in panic without documents or photographs as Nazi forces approached. London dealers close to the "restitution" business predict that 100 to 150 paintings will come off the walls of German museums in the next 25 years and be restored to the families of their original owners. As paintings washed around Europe in the 1950s without clear ownership, German museums whose collections of the 20th Century had been wiped out by Hitler bought what they could, at cheap prices, without asking too many questions. The past now catches up with the present. Lawyers in Vienna and Berlin now offer "no win no fee" deals to the descendants of concentration camp victims. The Nazis and their art collecting will continue to make headlines. Meanwhile the Fuehrermuseum - a long, low Fascist-style horizontal building lit by blue neon at night - still stands on the banks of the Danube at Linz. </body>

      <title>Why 'Death to America' remains Iran hardliners' slogan of choice</title>
      <description>Why Iran has not dropped anti-US slogan despite signs of detente</description>

      <body>Annual anti-US rallies have been held across Iran - the first since the election of Hassan Rouhani, a proponent of a more moderate approach towards Washington after years of outright hostility. Despite this recent "thaw", Monday's demonstrations were unprecedented in their scale and scope - and not without good reason. Iran's propaganda machine had been working for weeks ahead of the ceremonies to mobilise maximum public participation. The anniversary of the US embassy occupation in Tehran 34 years ago is taking place in unchartered territory for Iranian authorities, fresh from holding face-to-face nuclear talks with their US counterparts. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told his supporters a day before the rallies not to undermine Iranian negotiators, while he let the audience chant "Death to America" fiercely. Organisers and speakers of Monday's rallies have been careful to ensure that they keep a balance between their "Death to America"' chants and supporting the country's diplomatic efforts. Walking this tightrope is unlikely to please President Rouhani, who was elected on the promise to embark on a different approach in his foreign policy, and is regarded as a relative moderate. Conscious of their lack of public support on the issue of talks with the US, hardline critics of President Rouhani have done their utmost to promote suspicion and scepticism of such talks. They put up huge anti-US banners in the nation's capital but were forced to take them down after administration officials voiced their displeasure, saying they felt undermined. President Rouhani thanked the Supreme Leader for keeping hardliners at bay, even though each time he lends his support to Mr Rouhani Ayatollah Khamenei also reminds his audience that he is pessimistic about the outcome of talks with the US. How to strike an upbeat tone about the talks while giving credibility to the Supreme Leader's scepticism has proved to be a confusing task for President Rouhani. His website reported that he told visiting MPs he was "not optimistic" about nuclear talks - only for the statement to be removed from the website a few hours later. Hardline voices in the US pushing for further sanctions and an iron-fist approach, with repeats of the phrase "all options are on the table" have not helped win the Supreme Leader over either. He was particularly furious over remarks by US billionaire Sheldon Adelson - a staunch supporter of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and a big donor to the Republican party - who said dropping an atom bomb in the middle of Iran's desert would ensure that they get the message. "They should crush his mouth," declared Ayatollah Khamenei. During President Rouhani's trip to the UN in September, he spoke by phone with US President Barack Obama. Many Iranians were overjoyed as they felt that sanctions relief and better relations with the West was a likely prospect for the first time in many years. Since then, critical voices from hardliners have grown louder, starting from expressions of reservation to outright criticism of the government's moderate approach. Their response and continued insistence on keeping an antagonistic posture quickly dampened any illusion that the genie of US talks is out of the bottle - at least not yet. "We will keep chanting 'Death to America' as we continue our engagement in negotiations," said Ahmad Khatami, an influential hardline cleric. With Monday's anniversary having been promoted by official bodies affiliated with hardliners, including state-run TV, Iran's political calendar has highlighted the inconsistency between the government's trust-building approach and the state's traditional anti-US template. Iranian leaders have reason to be sceptical of talking to the US. The bitter memory of George Bush's "axis of evil" speech after Iran's help in overthrowing the Taliban in Afghanistan is still fresh and continually mentioned in order to evoke mistrust of the US. Hardliners as well as the Supreme Leader know that President Rouhani's election is indicative of the public's mood in support of at least engagement with the US if not a fully fledged friendship. At the same time, they are extremely conscious of not weakening Iran's nuclear leverage before extracting as many concessions from the American side as possible. A final statement issued by Monday's rally organisers said: "Sanctions removal is our minimum demand of US leaders if there is to be any trust-building." The main speaker at the ceremony in the capital was Saeed Jalili, Iran's former hardline chief nuclear negotiator, who came third in presidential elections. The choice of Mr Jalili was designed to deliver a clear message to the US: the genie can be put back in the bottle at any time. </body>

      <title>Kosovo violence leaves election in tatters</title>
      <description>Kosovo vote marred by attacks on polling stations</description>

      <body>It was a local election that was supposed to have an international impact. But it started with farce and ended with chaos - amid tear gas, smashed ballot boxes and accusations of "dark forces" at work. The votes from the majority ethnic-Serb, four most northern municipalities in Kosovo were supposed to have been tallied up on Sunday evening. But by Monday morning they remained uncounted, and it was unclear whether the abruptly curtailed election could be declared valid. Trouble had been brewing ever since Serbia agreed to normalise relations with the Republic of Kosovo in April. That was a key condition for the European Union to approve the start of membership talks with Belgrade - but it was greeted with dismay by the 50,000 or so ethnic Serbs who live in Kosovo's four northern municipalities. The deal spelled the end of the "parallel institutions" in which Belgrade funded healthcare, education and judicial systems for the North Kosovo Serbs. Instead there would be an association of Serb municipalities within the Republic of Kosovo. The municipal polls were supposed to make that possible. The Serbian government said the ethnic Serbs could only benefit by electing mayors and councillors who would be recognised in Pristina as well as Belgrade. It was never likely to be an easy sell. The Serbs in North Kosovo have been steadfast in their refusal to recognise the legitimacy of the government in Pristina. And for that matter, despite the normalisation agreement, Belgrade still says it will never recognise the Republic of Kosovo's unilaterally-declared independence. But Serbia was under pressure to keep its EU membership ambitions on track by showing that it was co-operating with the elections. So it tried to persuade the North Kosovo Serbs to vote. It formed a list of candidates under the banner "Srpska" (Serbian) - and promoted it with posters of Serbia's most powerful and popular politician, First Deputy Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic. Then it started appealing to people's pockets - suggesting a high turnout of Serb voters was the best way to ensure Belgrade continued payments to public sector workers. As polling day approached, the arm-twisting became ever more explicit. The implication was that if the people of North Kosovo were so proud to be Serbs, then they should follow the instructions of their government - or pay the price. "If you don't believe your own country, then don't believe your own pocket," said Danijela Vujicic, a senior member of the "Srpska" list in North Mitrovica, the largest municipality in North Kosovo. "If you don't want to accept your own country's message, please be good enough not to go and get a salary from the Republic of Serbia every month." But there were other arm-twisters at work. A campaign to boycott the vote was particularly well-organised in North Mitrovica, where the "No" banners and posters far outnumbered the publicity for any of the candidates. One of the boycott organisers, Nebojsa Jovic, said no-one was listening to the people whose lives would be most affected by the new system. "I invite all sides - the Serbian government, international community and Kosovo institutions - to understand the reality on the ground. Ninety-five percent of Serbs don't want to live in the state of Kosovo. We demand the same rights that the ethnic Albanian people had when they declared independence from Serbia." On election day, it seemed the boycott campaign was poised to score a spectacular success. There was a farcical start when some of the ballot boxes marshalled by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) were not ready for the early voters. But after that the polling stations in North Mitrovica were extremely quiet. With two hours to go before they shut, it seemed that very few Serbs had voted - raising the possibility that an ethnic Albanian mayor might be elected in North Mitrovica. That would have been an untenable - if darkly comic - proposition. More importantly, the whole idea of an association of Serb municipalities would have been in tatters. But an incident at a polling station at St Sava primary school prevented that scenario becoming reality. Masked intruders smashed up ballot boxes and assaulted staff. OSCE staff made a dramatic exit from North Mitrovica in full body armour and a convoy of Land Cruisers immediately after the intrusion. They said other polling stations in North Mitrovica were also attacked - and called a halt to the vote in nearby Zvecan. In a late night press conference, the head of the OSCE in Kosovo, Jean-Claude Schlumberger, said that "indications that the elections would be a success were obviously not acceptable news for everybody". With no count in the four northern municipalities, no-one could claim victory - or suffer defeat. The government swiftly placed the blame for the fiasco on "extremists" - but the "No" campaigners claimed the polling station attacks were ordered when it was clear the boycott had succeeded. They condemned the incidents, and suggested the "dark forces of the official political agenda" were responsible. Now the question is whether there will be another attempt to persuade North Kosovo's Serbs to vote in an election called by a state which they fervently believe should not exist - and to which, they insist, they will never belong. </body>

      <title>How Pakistan's Musharraf shook off legal cases</title>
      <description>Pakistan's former leader sheds legal challenges</description>

      <body>When Pakistan's former military ruler, Pervez Musharraf, ended his four-year exile and returned to the country to participate in May's elections, he took many people by surprise. He had made many powerful enemies during his eight-year rule, and some of them had been in power or were about to be. Besides, a slew of criminal charges had been lying dormant against him in various courts, awaiting his return. But on Monday, a court granted him bail in the last of the four criminal cases instituted against him, paving the way for his release. How he managed to turn what many had considered a miscalculation, into a legal triumph can be partly explained by the shifting nature of the country's political and judicial systems. He obviously returned to Pakistan thinking he had done no wrong. He also believed that his party could win some seats in parliament on the strength of an economic bubble his policies had created in the services sector in urban areas. In addition, he knew that the country's powerful military, of which he had been the head until 2008, would not allow the politicians and the judges to drag him through the courts and convict him as a criminal. Many thought he had miscalculated because the judges that he sacked in 2007 had been swept back to their positions by a wave of popular agitation that forced him out of power in 2008. Since then, the judges, led by Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, have used a policy of "judicial activism" to encroach significantly on the sphere of the executive. It is generally believed that what happened to Mr Musharraf was largely the result of an insurgent judiciary wanting to make history by arraigning a former army chief, something that no-one had done before. The May elections also restored a political leadership that had been ousted from power by Mr Musharraf in a military coup in 1999. The expectation was that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government would go the whole way to bring him down. It mostly seemed that way in the beginning. Days after landing in Pakistan in March, Mr Musharraf suffered the insult of having a shoe thrown at him in a crowded corridor of a court building. It narrowly missed. A little more than a week later, the Supreme Court instituted hearings to explore if he could be put on trial for treason for suspending the constitution and imposing emergency rule in November 2007. In April, an election tribunal, comprising high court judges, declared he could not be a candidate. He was arrested later that month for putting nearly 60 senior judges under house arrest in November 2007, when he was president. Over the next few months, his re-arrest was ordered in two high-profile murder cases; the 2006 killing of a rebel Baloch politician, Akbar Bugti, in a military operation, and the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in a gun and bomb attack. Since April, when he was first detained, he has remained under house arrest at his residence in Islamabad. During this period, public interest in his fate has been overtaken by other events, and the high pressure of the initial days has gradually eased. He managed to get bail in the judges' detention case when the complainant, a lawyer, decided he did not want to pursue the matter. Whether he was persuaded by someone from the military remains a matter of speculation. He was also granted bail in the Benazir Bhutto murder case on 20 May. The bail came two weeks after the chief prosecutor in the case, Chaudhry Zulfiqar, was gunned down in Islamabad, ostensibly by militants with alleged links to the 2008 Mumbai attacks - another case that he had been investigating. On 9 October, Mr Musharraf was given bail in the Akbar Bugti case, clearing him of all charges pending against him. But before he could be set free, he was re-arrested in the case of the 2007 Red Mosque siege in Islamabad in which more than 100 people, many of them armed militants, were killed. With the bail granted in this case as well on Monday, Mr Musharraf is now set to walk free. Legal experts say there was no evidence linking him directly to any of the offences for which he was charged. But there are also those who point out that if he were not a former army chief, he would have still be in the dock, given the vast powers the judiciary has arrogated to itself. The government of Prime Minister Sharif is also showing signs of a retreat. The only case in which Mr Musharraf could have been pinned down legally - the high treason case - failed to take off because the government, which alone can initiate a treason case under the law, has been procrastinating despite a commitment it made in the court in August. So unless he is charged in a fresh offence, Mr Musharraf cannot be kept in detention any more or banned from travelling abroad, experts say. The question is, will he opt to leave the country, which most elements in the government and the army would like him to do, or stay on to carve a political future for himself in Pakistan? The situation should become clear over the next few days. </body>

      <title>Facebook beheading: Who was the woman?</title>
      <description>Who was the victim in the Facebook beheading video?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24772724</url>

      <body>A film of a woman being beheaded in Mexico caused an international outcry in October when Facebook refused to remove it from its site. There have been hundreds of reports about the video - but why has no-one identified the victim in it? In the grainy footage, the woman is on her knees in jeans and a pink top, before a masked man holding a knife behind her says in a gruff voice: "Well, gentleman, this is what happens to all those in the Gulf Cartel. On behalf of Los Zetas." The rest of the video is a gruesome 40 seconds of cold-blooded murder, which caused international controversy recently when it was posted on Facebook. "Irresponsible" was the word used by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, about the social network's policy permitting the video to be uploaded. After a day or so of impassioned debate on both sides, Facebook reversed its decision and took the video down. Needless to say, it is still easy enough to find online, especially in Mexico. There are numerous websites dedicated to uploading videos of "narco-killings" or executions similar to the Facebook example. Yet despite the fact the victim is clearly identifiable and that presumably someone somewhere in Mexico must recognise her - as their wife, daughter or sister - no-one has come forward to name her. As far as the BBC has been able to ascertain, there is no investigation under way in Mexico to establish the woman's identity, or find the culprits of her murder. "The place to start [such an investigation] is with the municipal police," says Dr George Grayson, one of world's authorities on Los Zetas and author of the book, The Executioner's Men, about the criminal organisation. The problem, he says, is that although many municipal police officers may work for the public during the day - and sometimes even that is questionable - at night they work for the cartel. As such, he says, fear is a powerful tool used by both the Zetas and their rivals. "People are reluctant to report crimes, even heinous crimes. State forces are not much better in terms of their corruption and their collaboration with the cartels." Meanwhile, the unfortunate lady in the controversial film continues to be nameless and with no known identity - a "Jane Doe", reminiscent of dozens, perhaps hundreds of others who met a grisly end on camera in Mexico. In the case of the Facebook victim, one is faced with an even more basic problem when trying to identify her. Based on the non-descript wasteland in the video clip, it is almost impossible to establish where in Mexico she was killed and therefore which local authorities are responsible for investigating her murder. In essence, the act could have happened almost anywhere in the country where there is drug-related violence. Los Zetas' and Gulf Cartel's areas of influence, Oct 2013 QandA: Mexico's drug-related violence Stratfor: Cartel influence map "This gets to the heart of one of Mexico's biggest dramas - and that's the issue of investigation," says newspaper columnist, Julian Andrade, who has also published a number of books on the drug war. "Remember that statistics show we have a 96-98% rate of impunity. The majority of crimes are never going to be investigated here in Mexico. This is the profound problem - that even high profile cases like this one which make an impact in the world's media still reflect the incapacity of the authorities to carry out investigations." The BBC was due to interview the National Security Commissioner in Mexico, Manuel Mondragon, to pose questions about security and the investigation into the beheading which appeared on Facebook. Despite repeated requests, the security commissioner's office has still not granted us an interview or made any comment on the video. It may be the case, of course, that the woman in the film was deeply entrenched in the drug war as an active member of the Gulf Cartel, as her killer intimated before the attack. But George Grayson says it is almost impossible to know for sure what her supposed crime against Los Zetas was. "Often these ghoulish events take the form of settling scores against someone who has offended Los Zetas or is in conflict with Los Zetas," he says. It's possible she was just a relative or friend of a member of a rival drug gang, and was killed for revenge. He recounts a story he has written about in the past in which a woman in Nuevo Laredo, said to be an informant, was allegedly beaten to death by the sadistic former leader of Los Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino or "Z-40", in front of an assembled group of corrupt policemen, sending out a clear message not to cross the cartel. "Twenty to 25 years ago, women were involved in the narco-trade but you typically didn't kill women. Now all the rules have changed and the Zetas have been the main impulse in changing the rules." Despite the reams of words written about the Facebook beheading video, seemingly no-one asked the basic question, "Who was this woman?" If her execution is now considered so normal in today's Mexico that it doesn't even merit an investigation, in the final analysis, it is perhaps this - rather than any decision by Facebook - that is the most "irresponsible" element of this brutal killing.

      <title>Central African Republic: Religious tinderbox</title>
      <description>Muslim-Christian attacks escalate Central African crisis</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24802898</url>

      <body>Concern is growing that the Central African Republic is sliding into religious conflict following the overthrow of President Francois Bozize in a rebellion in March, as the BBC's Laeila Adjovi and Abdourahmane Dia report. Bossangoa, the birthplace of the deposed president, looks like a ghost town, with abandoned buildings, deserted streets and empty markets. In some of the government buildings, vegetation has taken over. But at the centre of Bossangoa, the Catholic Mission is bustling. It almost seems like the whole town has moved in, turning the Catholic Mission into a huge market and camp for displaced people. Tailors, hair-dressers and food- and cigarette-sellers are going about their business, next to thousands of blue tents covered with plastic sheeting with the logo of the UN children's fund, Unicef. More than 35,000 Christians have sought refuge here, after their homes were attacked by a loose alliance of former rebels known as Seleka, who ousted Mr Bozize. The figures are still rising and an estimated 1,000 people, mainly women and children, arrived last week, non-governmental organisations say. But even as people try to get on with their lives, this is a community under siege. People are too afraid to leave the Catholic Mission, even when their homes are just down the street. Nina Saragba was leaning against her shack and sobbing, when she spoke to the BBC. She said she had just heard that her brother had been shot dead as he tried to go to town. Fortunately, he was eventually found, badly beaten but alive. Residents say such attacks are common - as soon as they leave the Catholic Mission, they can be detained, beaten or shot and killed by Seleka fighters, if they are identified as members of a Christian self-defence militia called anti-balaka (anti-machete). The thirst for revenge is great among some residents. "I want to become a rebel and kill members of Seleka. We suffered too much. Muslims are our enemies," one 20-year-old man said. The CAR has been unstable most of the time since it gained independence from France in 1960, with numerous military coups and civil wars. However, the current conflict is unprecedented. For the first time in this small country, described as the heart of Africa, religious tension is taking centre stage. The Christian majority and Muslim minority always lived in harmony until March 2013 when Seleka leader Michel Djotodia seized power after his forces overran the capital, Bangui. Mr Djotodia became the first Muslim to rule CAR, installing himself as interim president and forming a transitional government that he says will organise democratic elections. The government denies targeting any group, but recognises the rise in inter-community violence. It sees the anti-balaka as a new rebel group, created by Mr Bozize's sympathizers in his political heartland of Bossangoa, about 400km (250 miles) north of the capital Bangui. Mr Djotodia has tried to reassure the international community by announcing the dissolution of Seleka. Officials say most Seleka fighters have been disarmed and confined to military barracks. In Bossangoa, there is fear on both sides. At the Muslim Friday prayers, some people came into the mosque leaving their shoes outside but not their Kalashnikovs. Khadija al-Hadj Abdou, the wife of a cattle herder, looked fragile and traumatised under her red and green veil, but her black eyes stayed dry when she told her story. The anti-balaka militia raided her village in early September, she said. She was shot in the neck, and fell to the ground. When she regained consciousness, she found the bodies of her father, husband and children, lying dead around her, Mrs Abdou said. She is now the sole survivor in her family. Similar violence has taken place in the city of Bouca, about 250km from Bangui. Moustapha Mohamed, a Muslim, says he saw the assassination of his father, a village chief, on 9 September. He escaped, thanks to his Christians neighbours who alerted many Muslims that armed groups were coming after them. On the same day, Muslims organised reprisal attacks against Christians. Aukin Nountabaye, a priest in the Bouca diocese, says he managed to escape after his church was stormed by members of the Muslim community. He fled Bouca, walking for four days to reach Bangui - where there is religious tension but no violence between the majority Christian and minority Muslim populations. More than 200 people are said to have fled to Bangui since violence erupted in Bouca. Both Mr Mohamed and Mr Nountabaye are influential members of the Association of Citizens of Bouca Living in Bangui, formed to improve relations between Christians and Muslims. They say there is a crisis of confidence between the two communities that had co-existed peacefully until now. The president of the association, Gourna Zako Justin, has called on the transition government to send to Bouca "a neutral force", implying the current army is not. With growing insecurity and the government accused of lacking control over its troops, the international community is under pressure to protect civilians. Last week, the United Nations approved a special 250-strong military force to protect UN workers in the CAR. The African Union has 2,100 peacekeepers in CAR, but promises to increase the number to 3,600 have not been kept. Nor have regional leaders come up with a peace plan to end conflict in CAR. And yet the CAR borders seven countries - Cameroon, Sudan, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Chad, Uganda, and Congo-Brazzaville. Many of these neighbours are already battling rebellions, which have displaced hundreds of thousands of people. So a more unstable CAR could bring more chaos to the region. Last week, the UN director of humanitarian operations, John Ging, described the situation in CAR as "chaotic". "We are seeing the seeds of a profoundly dangerous development between communities," Mr Ging said. "It's a tinderbox that can ignite into something very, very big and very, very bad." </body>

      <title>M23's decline raises hopes of DR Congo peace</title>
      <description>Does rebel defeat mean an end to years of conflict in Congo?</description>

      <body>The imminent defeat of DR Congo's M23 rebels is the result of shifting military and political dynamics that are presenting the most concrete prospects of peace in the vast, unstable central African nation for many years. M23 rebels in the east of the country have suffered major military defeats in the past week, forcing their political leader Bertrand Bisimwa to declare a ceasefire and seek a return to peace talks in Uganda. A defeat would send an intimidating message to at least 10 other rebel groups operating in the area, raising hopes that a lasting peace for the mineral-rich nation may be in sight after two decades of conflict. "M23 has only been the most active group in the east. Its defeat does not mean instant peace. It is early days," Stephanie Wolters of the South African-based Institute of Security Studies said. To understand the tenuous hope of possibly ending DR Congo's conflict, it is important to look at how M23 rebels were recently routed from its main bases by the Congolese army, a force generally known for its indiscipline, inefficiency and corruption. When M23 took control of Goma - the main city in the east with a population of one million - in November 2012, it embarrassed the government and put pressure on the international community to act after human rights violations emerged. President Joseph Kabila made changes to the military hierarchy and troops fighting in the east. In a sign that the changes might have started working, no reports of human rights violations blamed on the Congolese army have recently emerged, as has happened during previous operations. In March this year, the UN approved a new mission of 3,000 African soldiers with a mandate to fight the rebels. With the operational support of the existing UN Mission in DR Congo (Monusco), the new forces have used helicopters to target the rebels, allowing the army to advance on the frontline. It is expected that the UN mission will soon have drones for surveillance, a development that will offer insight into rebel movements and arms supplies. UN investigators have accused Rwanda and Uganda of supporting the M23. Both deny this. In what it says is a sign of goodwill that it wants a resolution to the conflict, Kampala has been hosting talks between Kinshasa and the M23. Jason Stearns wrote on his Congo Siasa blog that the absence of support from Rwanda to the rebels appeared to have tipped the scales. "The M23 was largely left to its own devices - the Rwandans just wouldn't pick up their phone calls," he posted, quoting an M23 leader. Ola Bello of the Cape Town-based South African Institute of International Affairs contends that for a long time, US military aid gave Rwanda "military and diplomatic carte blanche" in the regional conflict. The US has since withdrawn that military support, accusing Kigali of backing the M23 rebels, believed to use child soldiers. "This… shift in the regional diplomatic balance of forces has resulted in the Rwandan government's move to significantly scale back both its covert and overt support to the M23," Mr Bello said. It is, however, too soon to say M23 has been permanently pacified. For years, Kinshasa has failed to deal with rebellions in the east in any concerted way, partly because of the involvement of foreign actors. Kigali has said in the past it has sent its troops to DR Congo specifically to hunt down the FDLR - a Hutu rebel group linked to Rwanda genocide and which opposes Tutsi influence in the region. Unless DR Congo moves to deal with the FDLR, there is nothing to suggest that Rwanda would not be sucked back into the conflict, even if it stood back on this occasion. It has been alleged that DR Congo's army has worked with the FDLR to fight the M23. A comprehensive political process that seeks to address a series of issues beyond the armed insurgencies may save DR Congo. Ms Wolters said: "For years, Kinshasa has lacked the political will to really deal with the political problems for many different reasons. It is now up to them to decide what they want to do with the latest victory." Mr Bello said it was time that DR Congo acknowledged the significance of its neighbours in seeking solutions to the conflict in the east. "The M23's defeat… creates the political space to include all the conflict elements [economic motives especially] into a fulsome process of diplomatic negotiation between the DR Congo and its eastern neighbours and other conflict parties," he said. For the international community, the involvement of UN troops in direct combat may offer a model to reform peacekeeping missions to better protect civilians caught up in unrest and actively contribute to ending wars. </body>

      <description>Shares in struggling smartphone maker Blackberry fall 13% after it abandons plans to sell itself to its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings.</description>

      <body>Shares in struggling smartphone maker Blackberry have fallen 13% after it announced it had abandoned a plan to sell itself to its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings. Instead, it intends to raise $1bn (£627m) in fresh financing. Chief executive Thorsten Heins will step down and former Sybase chief executive John Chen will serve as interim chief executive. Last month, Blackberry reported a second-quarter net loss of $965m. Those losses were blamed on poor sales of its new smartphone, the Z10. Fairfax was planning to lead a consortium of firms in a takeover of Blackberry worth $4.7bn. But that plan, announced last month, has fallen through. Last week, Reuters reported that Fairfax was struggling to raise the financing needed for the deal. Instead, Fairfax, which owns a 10% stake in Blackberry, is contributing $250m to the new fund-raising. "This financing provides an immediate cash injection on terms favourable to Blackberry, enhancing our substantial cash position," said Barbara Stymiest, chair of Blackberry's board of directors. In September, the company announced a plan to cut 4,500 jobs, or 40% of its workforce, to reverse giant losses. The interim chief executive, John Chen, acknowledged the challenge ahead: "Blackberry is an iconic brand with enormous potential - but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success." Some analysts remain sceptical about the firm's prospects. "Now we're back to the downward spiral," said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. "They've got $1bn more cash that buys them time. The drumbeat of negativity is likely to continue." </body>

      <body>HSBC saw profit surge 30% in the three months to the end of September, boosted by a strong performance in the UK and Hong Kong. Reported pre-tax profit was $4.5bn (£2.8bn), compared with $3.4bn for the same period a year ago, the bank said. The bank's home markets of the UK and Hong Kong were responsible for more than half of the group's profits. HSBC also confirmed it was being investigated as part of a global probe into currency trading manipulation. Barclays, RBS, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank and UBS have already confirmed that regulators, including the UK's Financial Conduct Authority, have been in contact with them in relation to suggestions that currency markets could have been rigged. "We see reasons for optimism with some evidence of a broadening recovery," group chief executive Stuart Gulliver said on the outlook for the bank. Operating expenses fell by $700m to $9.6bn during the period, but the bank said that was mainly due to the absence of one-off costs from last year. Underlying costs were up on the year, which HSBC blamed on investments, wage inflation and regulatory-related costs. Mr Gulliver is aiming to streamline the bank's operations by focusing on high-growth markets in Asia. In October, it sold its Panama business for an estimated $1.1bn gain. The firm has closed or sold 12 non-core businesses since the start of the year. "Hong Kong continues to benefit from its close economic relationship with mainland China. We remain well positioned to capitalise on improving economic conditions in these markets," added Mr Gulliver. </body>

      <body>The UK is set to grow faster than any other Western economy, according to the ICAEW - the body representing English and Welsh accountants. Its monitor of business confidence, sponsored by accountants Grant Thornton, suggests economic growth of 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The report identified signs of rising business confidence. Its view of the economy mirrors that of the CBI, whose recent assessment also suggest a strong pick-up in growth. The CBI, whose annual conference begins on Monday, said the UK economy was recovering at a "slow and steady" pace. The ICAEW report says the recovery is happening among both business and consumer sectors and that companies are expecting growth in exports and business investment next year. It says confidence in business is at its highest for the 10 years it has been running and has also been the longest sustained period of rising optimism registered. Michael Izza, chief executive of ICAEW, said: "This quarter's report shows that the UK economic recovery is well under way. "The shape of the recovery is changing as businesses respond to rising confidence by looking to new markets and increasing their investment plans." The ICAEW uses forecasts from the Centre for Economics and Business Research to compare the outlook for UK growth to other western nations. It says that the UK is likely to be leading those countries by the end of next year. The CBI predicts growth this year of 1.4%, up from the 1.2% forecast in August, following a strong third-quarter performance. It then expects a growth rate of 2.4% in 2014, Cridland said. Latest official figures showed that the UK's economy grew by 0.8% between July and September, with the Office for National Statistics saying there had been a "fairly strong" performance across all sectors. </body>

      <body>Business is suffering a crisis in public confidence, the president of the CBI employers' group has said. Sir Mike Rake told the organisation's annual conference in London that business was seen by some people as the "enemy". But the truth was that the UK would only thrive with successful, productive businesses of all sizes, he said. "We want to be, we can be, and we are partners in building prosperity," he said. "Some of the rhetoric we've heard recently suggests that business is somehow the enemy - we are not, and this could not be further from the truth. "Business is undoubtedly suffering a crisis in public confidence - as we have seen in banking, and now in the current debate around energy." Recent prices rise by energy suppliers sparked calls for price controls, windfall taxes, and an investigation into whether the market was working efficiently. But Sir Mike, chairman of BT, said "over simplistic" statements just played to the public gallery. "But they will not address the complex problems that need to be resolved - indeed, they are very likely to have the opposite effect." Transforming the energy market will be costly, he warned, adding: "The obvious issue is how to balance long-term investment with the short-term pressures on household budgets. "People are of course concerned about rising prices. They feel, rightly or wrongly, that they're being unfairly treated. "There are no easy answers, but the public deserves better than politicians playing the blame game," he said. The CBI president criticised the "commercially harmful" indecision over HS2 and urged politicians to stick to long-term infrastructure decisions. "Vision and implementation are the answers to many of the UK's perennial challenges on transport: Road, rail and air, and energy. A co-ordinated plan for making this happen is essential," he said. The delivery of some big projects on the ground "is just not happening", he warned. "Political indecision is commercially harmful - delivery has got to be ramped up." </body>

      <body>Drugs giant Johnson and Johnson has agreed to pay more than $2.2bn (£1.4bn) to settle allegations over its marketing techniques, the Justice Department has said. The firm is alleged to have paid incentives to doctors and pharmacies to promote three of its medicines. These included anti-psychotic drugs Risperdal and Invega, as well as heart drug Natrecor. The firm also allegedly promoted the drugs for uses not officially allowed. While US doctors can prescribe medicines as they see fit, pharmaceutical companies cannot advocate any use of their drugs that has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is the third biggest settlement involving a drugs firm in US history. It is intended to resolve both civil and criminal allegations involving the drugs at both state and federal level across the US. </body>

      <body>Wall Street hedge fund giant SAC Capital has agreed to plead guilty to insider trading charges, according to the US Attorney's office. The firm, founded and run by billionaire manager Steven Cohen, will pay $1.8bn (£1.1bn) to settle the charges, a US Attorney statement said. SAC has also agreed to give up its investment advisory business, it added. The fund was charged in July with four counts of securities fraud and one count of wire fraud. Full details of the settlement are due to be revealed later, according to a notice sent by the office of US Attorney Preet Bharara. The settlement comes after a seven-year-long investigation. In July, SAC pleaded not guilty in a New York court and denied the insider trading charges. Prosecutors had alleged that the fund was involved in "systematic insider trading" that allowed it to make hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profits. Prosecutors said the alleged crimes dated back to 1999 and continued until at least 2010. They allege that SAC obtained inside information on publicly traded companies and traded on that information to boost returns and fees. "[SAC's] relentless pursuit of an information 'edge' fostered a business culture within SAC in which there was no meaningful commitment to ensure that such 'edge' came from legitimate research and not inside information," court filings said. At its peak, SAC Capital managed about $15bn in assets. </body>

      <body>The Co-operative Bank plans to cut its branch network by at least 15% by the end of next year, shedding 50 of its 324 branches and large numbers of jobs. The bank said it would "significantly enhance" its internet and mobile banking services as a result. The details came as it unveiled its rescue plan, drawn up at the weekend. The deal will see creditors to the group, led by half-a-dozen hedge funds, end up with 70% of shares in the bank, leaving Co-op Group with 30%. Speaking about possible job cuts, Euan Sutherland, group chief executive, told BBC Radio 5 live: "We do need to take the overall costs down, unfortunately [that] will hit jobs, but we don't have the details today." Mr Sutherland added that he was "optimistic" about the future. "We have taken a major step forward towards achieving our plan to secure the future of the bank," he said. The Co-op Group will contribute funds of £462m towards the rescue plan. It plans to list the bank on the London Stock Exchange in 2014. Investors must now vote to back the plan if Co-op Bank is to avoid being taken over by the Bank of England in a process called resolution. The Co-op Group hopes to protect the co-operative culture of the bank, by writing a pledge into the bank's principles or articles of association that it will conduct only what it sees as ethical business. It has taken the unusual step of communicating this change to the bank's constitution to its five million customers in newspaper adverts. Co-op had to come up with a rescue for its bank after the discovery of a £1.5bn hole in its balance sheet, caused by bad loans and the 2009 merger with Britannia building society. Two weeks ago, the mutual group said it would lose overall control of the Co-op Bank, following a restructuring of a rescue deal, which will provide the bank with extra capital. </body>

      <body>The boss of Centrica, which owns British Gas, has said he will not take his bonus this year amid anger over energy bills. Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, said that trust in the industry was at an "all-time low". British Gas is one of four big energy firms to raise prices for the winter, having announced a 9.2% increase from 23 November. Mr Laidlaw said bills could be cut if green levies were switched to taxation. Mr Laidlaw was speaking at the CBI annual conference in London, where he said the energy sector needed to urgently rebuild trust with consumers. As a result, he said he was not going to take a bonus. "Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it," he said. Mr Laidlaw, who joined Centrica as chief executive in July 2006, repeated the industry's pledge to cut bills if the government moved environmental and social costs to other forms of taxation. "Those cost reductions would be immediately passed on to customers," he said. Mr Laidlaw, said the energy industry was "in the eye of the storm", conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills were made up and improve the process of switching suppliers. The average dual-fuel annual British Gas bill will rise by £123 this winter. Other firms have also announced price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November. Npower announced the biggest rise, of 10.4%, which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power is raising prices by 8.6% from 6 December. </body>

      <body>More than 30,000 low paid workers will receive a pay rise worth up to £400 a year after a rise in the voluntary "living wage" rate. The UK Living Wage rate, which is not binding on employers, has been increased by 20p to £7.65 an hour. It is much higher than the legal UK minimum wage of £6.31 an hour. In London, the Living Wage rate has been increased by 25p to £8.80 an hour. A total of 432 employers have signed up to pay the rate, up from 78 last year. Firms signed up to the voluntary scheme include Barclays, Oxfam, Legal and General and the National Portrait Gallery. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said the living wage had become "a must-have badge of honour for employers". "By looking out for the Living Wage badge, you can now choose to support businesses that are doing right thing. It works just like Fairtrade and will grow even faster with consumer support," he added. Dominic Johnson, employee relations director at Barclays, said paying the rate had improved retention rates for its cleaners. "Early research on the impact of the Living Wage for cleaners on Barclays' contracts shows our suppliers have a 92% retention rate versus an industry average of 35%," he said. The Living Wage is set independently each year, based on the basic cost of living in the UK. The new rates were announced at the start of Living Wage Week. Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband said if his party won the next election, it would offer firms a 12-month tax break in 2016 if they agree to pay the living wage. </body>

      <body>(Close): Stronger mining and banking shares boosted the FTSE 100, which ended the day up 28.8 points, or 0.43%, at 6763.62. HSBC gained 2.3%, its biggest one-day rise in four months, after it reported a 30% jump in quarterly profits. Fresnillo, up 4.5%, was index's biggest riser, followed by Rio Tinto, up 3.3%. Royal Bank of Scotland, down 2.4%, continued to fall after Friday's warning that it will make a loss this year. The mining sector was lifted by strong data on China's economy - the world's biggest market for mined products. A report said China's service sector grew at its fastest pace in a year in October. That comes just days after data showed that China's manufacturing activity rose to an 18-month high October. </body>

      <body>UK construction activity grew at its fastest pace for six years last month, an influential survey has suggested. The Markit/CIPS construction purchasing managers' index (PMI) rose to 59.4 in October, up from 58.9 in September. It is the sharpest increase since September 2007, and higher than economists had forecast. Any figure greater than 50 indicates expansion. The construction PMI has now been above that level for six months in a row. "UK construction output continues to rise like a phoenix from the ashes, with housing, commercial and civil engineering activity all seeing strong rates of expansion at the start of the fourth quarter," said Markit economist Tim Moore. Housing activity was the strongest performing sector in the survey. However, the pace of its expansion slipped slightly from September's 10-year high. Construction was one of the hardest-hit sectors of the UK economy in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, as the government and businesses axed building projects to save money. The figures are the latest in a series of positive figures on the UK economy and follow a strong reading for the UK manufacturing sector on Friday. However, IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer said construction was a relatively small part of the UK economy. "It needs to be remembered that the sector only accounts for 6.3% of national output," he added. </body>

      <title>EU best for UK business, says CBI</title>
      <description>Staying in the European Union is worth between 4-5% of annual output and is by far the best thing for business, the CBI says.</description>

      <body>Staying in the European Union is worth between 4-5% of UK annual output and "overwhelmingly" best for business - but reforms are needed, the CBI says. Ahead of its national conference, the business group said research found EU membership is worth £62-78bn to the UK. It calls for barriers to e-commerce to be removed by the EU, for it to become more outward-looking and for a "re-focus" in the work of EU commissioners. It also wants to see a permanent opt-out from the Working Time Directive. The CBI report, compiled after questioning its members, also said business wanted a moratorium on legislation which could be made at national level. The CBI's director general, John Cridland, said: "We have looked beyond the political rhetoric to examine the pros and cons of EU membership and British business is unequivocal - the Single Market is fundamental to our future. "We are better off in a reformed EU than outside with no influence. Each year, membership is worth £3,000 to every household in this country." The government wants to negotiate a new deal with the EU. Mr Cameron has said the EU needs to change to allow Britain, or other member states, not to be bound by all its decisions. If he can secure a new deal, Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged a referendum on the UK's relationship with the EU by 2017 should the Conservative Party win an outright majority. The Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, said: "This compelling report makes a powerful business case for the UK's continued membership of the EU." He said he had been told on a visit to India last week that EU membership was one of the reasons why the UK was an attractive place to invest. The comments come after the group suggested the UK economy was recovering at a "slow and steady" pace. "The UK is now set fair for growth with confidence returning to Britain's entrepreneurs," Mr Cridland added. "The recovery won't be spectacular, just slow and steady, but appears more solid and better-rooted." Shadow minister for Europe Gareth Thomas said: "The CBI's report clearly shows that the business community doesn't want to see Britain sleepwalk out of the EU. "Today's report shows that Europe brings each UK household £3,000 a year. David Cameron is willing to put this at risk because his approach to Europe is based on narrow party interest, not Britain's national interest." "Labour believes that a commitment to staying at the heart of the EU, along with a clear programme of deliverable reforms is the best course for Britain. "Labour has long called for reforms to make Europe work better, including a new EU Commissioner for Growth to help focus Europe on delivering the jobs and prosperity that our country needs." </body>

      <title>EU support wafer thin, says Cameron</title>
      <description>British people's support for staying in the European Union is "wafer thin" but can be increased if the relationship with Brussels changes, David Cameron says.</description>

      <body>British people's support for staying in the European Union is currently "wafer thin", David Cameron has said. The prime minister argued that his promise to renegotiate powers with Brussels before holding an "in-out" referendum had the "overwhelming support" of the public. He told business leaders the argument for remaining in the EU could be won if there was substantial reform. Labour is warning that the UK could "sleepwalk out of the EU". But Sir Michael Rake - president of the CBI business group - has warned both the Conservatives and Labour against political posturing on Europe and other issues, including energy prices, immigration, and the HS2 rail project. "It is very important that politicians, across the board, are careful about the words they use and the policies they espouse because this can lead to prejudicing investment and careless words can cost jobs," he told the BBC. Mr Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on whether the UK should quit the EU by the end of 2017 if the Conservative Party wins a majority at the next general election. This, he says, would follow a fundamental renegotiation of the relationship between London and Brussels. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, Mr Cameron said: "The current consent for remaining inside the European Union is wafer thin. We haven't made the argument enough about why it matters." He added: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It's a long-term strategy for Britain." Mr Cameron also said: "What I've put forward, I believe, has the overwhelming support of the British people and business people too." The CBI has published a report saying the EU is worth between 4% and 5% of UK annual output and is "overwhelmingly" best for business but that reforms are needed. The prime minister described the findings as "hugely helpful" to the European debate, adding: "The trouble is that the debate was just slipping away." He added: "We are doing what the British people and, I think, most business want. Let's get in there and negotiate a better deal for Britain. Then let's put the question." Mr Cameron said it was not for the UK to "stand in the way" of further political and financial integration by members of the eurozone, but it was "perfectly legitimate to say we outside the euro need some changes too". For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the conference that the UK was "better placed to shape Europe's future if we are fully engaged rather than having one foot out the door". He added: "We are clear that there is no future for Britain in walking away from our biggest market - or threatening to do so for reasons of internal party management. "Europe needs reform, but to walk away from our EU membership would be reckless, foolish and deeply damaging. On Britain's future in Europe, the national interest must come first." The CBI has said uncertainty about the outcome of a future referendum is already having a negative impact on inward investment. But the UK Independence Party said the CBI's view that leaving the EU "would somehow mean a sudden end to trading with Europe" was "deeply flawed". "The CBI does not consider the more realistic option that if we left the single market and freed ourselves from its red tape and politicised agenda we would still be able to continue to trade strongly with Europe on our own terms," said the party's leader Nigel Farage. "Leaving the EU would not mean turning our back on Europe." </body>

      <body>Eurozone factory orders rose for a fourth consecutive month in October, leaving factories unable to keep up with demand, according to a survey. Manufacturers in the 17-country eurozone saw their backlogs rise higher as stocks of finished goods continued to fall. The Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) stood at 51.3 in October, up from 51.1 in September. Any reading of above 50 suggests expansion. Markit said that only France and Greece, out of the 17 countries that use the euro, failed to enjoy improved conditions. The organisation's chief economist, Chris Williamson, however, said that the pace of growth was "modest overall". "While the recovery goes on, it is by all accounts frustratingly slow. In particular, the modest gains in output and new orders remain insufficient to encourage firms to take on more staff," he added. Demand for manufactured goods increased last month, but at a slower pace than in September, while factories made little change to prices, the survey showed. "Output charges rose for the second successive month, but the rate of inflation remained marginal as competition remained strong and market demand lacklustre," Markit said. </body>

      <body>The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) says it has opened an investigation into the government's contracts with G4S and Serco for tagging criminals. It comes after an audit suggested the firms had been charging for tagging criminals who were either dead, in jail or never tagged in the first place. In July, the government had asked the SFO to consider carrying out an investigation into G4S. G4S said it would co-operate fully with the SFO investigation. A spokesman for G4S said: "G4S confirms it has today received notice that the director of the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into the 'contract for the provision of electronic monitoring services, which commenced in April 2005, as amended and extended until the present day'. "G4S has confirmed to the SFO that it will co-operate fully with the investigation." The audit by accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, launched in May, alleged that the charging discrepancies began at least as far back as the start of the current contracts, in 2005, but could have dated back to the previous contracts in 1999. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the two firms that an independent "forensic audit" - a search for possible illegality - should be conducted, which among other things would need to examine email trails between bosses. G4S was reported to the SFO when it refused to co-operate with this further audit, while Serco allowed a further forensic audit to take place. In the course of the audit in September, the Ministry of Justice provided material to the SFO in relation to Serco's conduct. G4S made headlines after it failed to provide all of its contracted security guards for the London 2012 Olympics, prompting extra military personnel to be called in to fill the gap and leaving the firm with losses of £88m. </body>

      <body>Ryanair shares have slumped 13% after the company warned that profits are likely to fall this year. It now expects to make a profit of between 500m euros (£423m; $674m) and 520m euros for the financial year ending in March, down from its previous projection of 570m euros. The airline said it expected fares to fall 10% over the winter months and was grounding aircraft as a result. Ryanair will also introduce allocated seating from February next year. Monday's profit warning means that Ryanair will report its first fall in annual profits in five years. It also comes just two months after the company made its first profit warning in a decade. Europe's biggest discount airline said that fares had been falling because of "increased price competition, softer economic conditions in Europe and the weaker euro-sterling exchange rate". "The continuing fare and yield softness means that full-year profits will be lower than previously guided," Michael O'Leary, chief executive of Ryanair, said in a statement. The warning came as the airline reported a net profit of 602m euros for the six months to the end of September, a rise of just 1% from a year earlier. It said it carried 49 million passengers during the period and generated a revenue of 3.26bn euros, up 5% from the same period last year. Ryanair has enjoyed robust growth over the past few years as a global economic downturn saw many consumers turn to more affordable travel options. However, the company said that "the next 12 months will see a brief pause in traffic growth". Given the weak conditions in key markets and increased competition, the airline is looking to focus on improving its service in an attempt to retain customers and attract new ones. It has announced a plan to introduce allocated seating from 1 February next year which will allow passengers to select seats on aircraft, as long as they check in more than 24 hours before departure. The airline said the move will make "the boarding process smoother" and enable "families or other groups to ensure that they sit together". It added that the return to allocated seating was in response to enormous demand and was "part of the airline's commitment to listen to its customers". In recent weeks, the carrier has also introduced measures such as allowing a small second carry-on bag and a 24 hour "grace period" to allow passengers to correct minor booking errors. </body>

      <title>HS2 opponents risk UK's future - PM</title>
      <description>Opponents of the HS2 rail link are "putting our country's future at risk", Prime Minister David Cameron tells the CBI annual conference.</description>

      <body>Opponents of the HS2 rail link are "putting our country's future at risk", Prime Minister David Cameron has said. He spoke at the CBI annual conference after speculation that Labour would withdraw its support for the high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will say Labour's support is "not at any cost". Mr Cameron also said the new boss of HS2 would find ways to cut the estimated £50bn cost of the scheme. He said Sir David Higgins would "make absolutely sure we drive every extra bit of cost out of this that we can, so it comes in under the budget that's been set". "I want to make sure we get every penny of value for money from this HS2 investment," he said. "I think it is fantastic that Sir David Higgins - the man who built the Olympics on time and on budget - is going to be running HS2." He added: "People who are against it, in my view, are putting our country's future at risk, they are putting the future of the North of England at risk," he said. "We need to have a concerted consensus across business, across politics, that we get behind these large infrastructure projects." He said making the investment would "make sure our economy shares growth between the north and south - it will link eight of our 10 biggest cities". Sir David has said he believes the scheme can come in "substantially" under the current budget if the £14bn set aside for contingency costs is reduced. Mr Balls, meanwhile, told the conference: "The Labour Party cannot - and will not - give the government a blank cheque." "That is what you would expect from any credible official opposition seeing a government desperately mismanaging a project. And that is what is happening here with the costs having shot up to £50bn. "We will put the national interest and the taxpayer interest first. "We will take a hard-headed look at the costs and benefits of the scheme to ensure this is the best way to spend £50bn for the future of our country." He said a Labour government would set up an independent infrastructure commission to end delays in major infrastructure projects. In his speech, CBI president Sir Mike Rake criticised "commercially harmful" indecision over HS2. "We cannot have every major infrastructure decision continuously redebated at every turn, as we're seeing with HS2," he told the conference. "Undoubtedly, a better effort should be made to communicate the benefits of high speed rail, and this must be positioned within an overall, long-term strategy of what the country needs across all modes of transport. "Decisions have to be made, and once they have been made then we should stick to them." MPs last week approved funding to prepare for the high-speed rail network. The HS2 project would see lines built between Birmingham and London, followed by a V-shaped second phase building separate tracks from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. The government hopes to begin construction on the first phase of HS2 in 2017 and open that part of the line in 2026. The additional lines to Leeds and Manchester could then be completed by 2032-33. </body>

      <title>Downton Abbey 'can help UK business'</title>
      <description>The popularity of the Royal Family and the TV drama Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers are told.</description>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <title>Tesco to use face-scan ad targeting</title>

      <body>Tesco is installing face-scanning technology at its petrol stations to target advertisements to individual customers at the till. The technology, made by Lord Sugar's digital signage company Amscreen, will use a camera to identify a customer's gender and approximate age. It will then show an advertisement tailored to that demographic. Tesco says the screens will be rolled out across all of its 450 forecourts in the UK. "It's like something out of Minority Report," said Amscreen's chief executive Simon Sugar, Lord Sugar's eldest son. "But this could change the face of British retail, and our plans are to expand the screens into as many supermarkets as possible." A Tesco spokeswoman said: "This is not new technology." "No data or images are collected or stored and the system does not use eyeball scanners or facial-recognition technology", she added. The length of someone's hair could be used to work out their gender, she said. Privacy campaigners said companies had to tell their customers they were using the technology. Nick Pickles, from Big Brother Watch, said: "If people were told that every time they walked into a supermarket, or a doctor's surgery or a law firm, that the CCTV camera in the corner is trying to find out who they are, I think that will have a huge impact on what buildings people go into." Systems could only be "ethically deployed" if customers agreed to opt in to having their behaviour tracked, he added. Philip James, joint head of technology at Pitmans law firm, argues that this technology is similar to the way social media sites tailor adverts to users based on the content of their profiles. "The capture of facial signatures represents a potentially much greater infringement of customers' privacy in the absence of prior consent," he said. The screens are expected to reach five million customers. </body>

      <body>The government is expected to announce the creation of a commission to look at the reasons behind high levels of complaints surrounding used car sales. Second-hand car sales by independent traders consistently top the list of gripes according to the Citizens Advice consumer helpline. Consumer and industry groups are being invited to discuss the trend and report back by the spring next year. Trade bodies say complaints are dealt with quickly by reputable dealers. Used car buyers are being given purchasing tips and reminded of their rights as part of National Consumer Week, which starts on Monday. The campaign is aimed at preventing the kind of situation that 22-year-old graduate Natasha Akintunde found herself in. She bought a used Nissan Micra, with low mileage, for more than £1,000, only for the clutch to fail within weeks. She said she found out later that the car had been an insurance write-off. She was given a replacement, but said the brakes failed when her mother was driving it home from the seller. "It has put me off driving for a while, because of the worry of what happened. I just want my money back, I don't really want to buy another used car," she said. Buyers are being encouraged to go through a checklist before they buy a second-hand car. Tips include: Consumer minister Jo Swinson said it was vital, with seven million used cars sold every year, that consumers were "better equipped to make good decisions" when buying cars. "Rogue dealers are going to find there is action taken against them. They need to shape up, because they are not going to get away with it," she said. Stuart James, director of the Retail Motor Industry Federation, agreed there were unscrupulous operators in any business, but said many car sellers were reputable and would deal quickly with genuine complaints. He said many of the calls to Citizens Advice were from people seeking information about their rights, rather than actual complaints about traders. There are many approved schemes that have independent arbitration if things go wrong with sales and repairs. The Retail Motor Industry Federation has set up schemes such as the Trust My Garage programme that ensures members that carry the badge adhere to a code of practice. There are certain rights that people can fall back on if they discover a problem soon after driving off the forecourt. Any purchase must be as described by the seller, of satisfactory quality given its age and the price paid, and be roadworthy. Andy Foster, director of operations and policy at the Trading Standards Institute, said this meant traders should generally offer a repair if something goes wrong within a few weeks, assuming the problem was not pointed out at the time the car was sold. A replacement or even a refund could be available. If the problem occurred after a number of months, then the buyer might have to prove that the fault existed at the time of sale in order to get a repair. However, buyers have fewer rights if they buy the car from a private individual, such as through an internet auction site. </body>

      <title>Labour offers living wage tax breaks</title>
      <description>Firms could earn a year-long tax break if they agree to pay the so-called "living wage", under plans drawn up by Labour leader Ed Miliband.</description>

      <body>Some of Britain's lowest-paid workers could get pay rises under plans drawn up by Labour leader Ed Miliband. If the party wins the next election, Mr Miliband plans to offer firms a 12-month tax break in 2016 if they agree to pay the so-called "living wage". The pledge was cautiously welcomed by business groups, but there were fears many firms would find it unaffordable. The government said it encouraged firms to pay their lowest paid staff more provided it did not cost jobs. The living wage is an informal benchmark based on the amount an individual needs to earn to cover the basic costs of living. It is set at £8.55 an hour in London and £7.45 an hour in the rest of the UK. The national minimum wage, set by the chancellor, is significantly lower at £6.31 an hour for adults, and £5.03 for those aged 18 to 21. Under the proposals put forward by Mr Miliband, private firms would be able to claim back about a third of the cost of raising their staff members' wages to the living wage - amounting to £445 a year on average per worker, although it could potentially reach £1,000. Labour claims the plan will save money because benefit bills would go down and tax revenues would increase. But costs to businesses would rise as a result of signing up. And those that do so could only claim the money back for one year. Conservative former chancellor Ken Clarke said Mr Miliband's proposals were ill-judged "electoral bribery" that employers and the economy could ill afford. "It isn't quite free beer for the workers but it is electoral bribery really, and [Mr Miliband] is quite incapable of understanding how a country in an acute financial crisis, with an enormous fiscal deficit, can possibly afford this," said the cabinet minister. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps added: "Labour got us into a mess with too much borrowing and too much debt and now they're calling for yet more borrowing and more debt." The government said it encouraged employers to pay above the national minimum wage "when they are profitable and when it's not at expense of jobs". It said ministers were doing everything they could to "help people on low pay with the cost of living". The living wage announcement comes ahead of a speech on Tuesday in which Mr Miliband is expected to say that tackling low incomes is key to solving squeezed living standards. He is expected to warn that Britain risks "an era of growth without prosperity" as wages stagnate while household costs continue to rise. He will add: "Low wages aren't just bad for working people and their families. They are driving up the social security bill too, as the country has to subsidise more and more low paid jobs with tax credits and benefits. "So to those who say we can't afford to do anything about wages in our country today: I say we can't afford not to." Katja Hall, chief policy director for the Confederation of British Industry, said the scheme may help some firms pay more, but many companies simply could not afford it. "The best way to boost wage growth in the longer term is to build a sustainable recovery and invest in the productivity growth that will boost wages," she said. The Federation of Small Businesses said it was an "interesting proposition" but said a national insurance exemption next year could help firms increase pay sooner. The Living Wage Foundation, which encourages companies to set wages which reflect the cost of living, said paying the higher rates was necessary. The Foundation, which was set up by community group Citizens UK, runs the long-running living wage campaign backed by charities, trade unions and businesses for the introduction of a living wage. Rhys Moore, the group's director, said: "With working poverty on the rise, paying a living wage is becoming a must for every responsible employer. "We are working with businesses across the UK to help them do the right thing, so that from the chief executive to the cleaner, hard work pays." But RMT union leader Bob Crow said: "Poverty pay should not be an option and the only solution is to raise the statutory minimum wage to the current living wage rate." Updated living wage rates are due to be announced on Monday. The UK rate will be announced by Bishop of Nottingham Paul Butler, while the London rate will be set out by London Mayor Boris Johnson. It comes as it emerged the number of people paid less than the living wage grew from 4.8 million to 5.2 million in the last 12 months, according to the consultants, KPMG. And the number of children living in households earning less than the living wage has increased from 1.82 million to 1.96 million, according to research by Save the Children. </body>

      <title>'Action' on water bills promised</title>
      <description>Downing Street says "action on water bills" will be announced next week as part of government efforts to address concerns about rises in utility costs.</description>

      <body>Downing Street has indicated "action on water bills" will be announced next week as part of efforts to address concerns about high utility costs. A No 10 spokesman said it wanted regulators to examine whether the market was "delivering for consumers". Labour leader Ed Miliband has said the water industry should be "scrutinised", alongside energy, to deal with what he says is a cost of living crisis. Thames Water has said it wants to increase bills by up to 8%. But regulator Ofwat has challenged the proposed increase and is examining whether financial gains the company has made elsewhere make such bill rises unnecessary. Thames Water is the only one of the 18 regulated water companies to have applied to the regulator to increase prices in advance of the next pricing review. Unlike gas and electricity, consumers cannot switch their water suppliers. Concerns have been raised about price levels in parts of the country, particularly the south west of England, where consumers were given a £50 rebate on their bills earlier this year. A No 10 spokesman said the PM took the size of "household bills across the piece seriously". "There will be some action next week from Defra with the intention of looking at water bills," he said. "The prime minister wants to see household costs across the piece being reduced as low as possible. The intention is to try to reduce the burdens on hard-pressed families." The prime minister "wants regulators to look at the industry they regulate and make sure that they are robust and delivering what they need to deliver for consumers", the spokesman said. Mr Miliband told the Western Morning News: "I think we should be looking at all markets to make sure they are working properly and that includes the water industry. "I think the water industry is something that should be scrutinised to make sure it is working properly and make sure it is working properly for the benefit of consumers, because I know concerns have been raised. "I'm proud Labour is championing this agenda and I think it is consistent with believing what a market economy can do, and water is part of that." Shadow Environment Secretary Maria Eagle called on Mr Cameron to "require water companies to introduce a social tariff to help those who are struggling". She said Labour would seek to amend the forthcoming Water Bill legislation to "require all water companies to participate in a national affordability scheme and review whether there is a need for a tougher regulatory regime". </body>

      <title>China service sector growth speeds up</title>
      <description>China's service sector grows at its fastest pace in a year in October, the latest sign of a recovery in the world's second-largest economy.</description>

      <body>China's service sector grew at its fastest pace in a year in October, the latest sign of a recovery in the world's second-largest economy. The non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 56.3 in October from 55.4 in September. The report comes just days after data showed that China's manufacturing PMI rose to an 18-month high October. China's service sector, which includes construction and aviation, accounts for nearly 43% of its overall economy. The PMI is a key gauge of the sector's health and a reading above 50 indicates expansion. "The non-manufacturing sector should continue to develop at a stable rate over the next few months, though there still needs to be more market training and promotion to further release the service sector's potential," said Cai Jin, vice-president of the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing. After years of rocketing growth, China saw its pace of growth slow in the first two quarters of this year. There have been concerns that its growth may dip further. not least because of a slowdown in demand for its exports from key markets. However, data released over the past few weeks has helped allay those fears. Figures released last month showed that its economy expanded 7.8% in the July-to-September quarter from a year earlier. That is up from the 7.5% growth recorded in the previous three months. Official figures also showed growth in industrial output, retail sales and fixed asset investment in October. China's President Xi Jinping, who took charge earlier this year amid the slowdown, said he is confident that the country's economy will continue to grow. "There are sufficient factors supporting China's economic development," the president was quoted as saying by the state-owned Xinhua news agency over the weekend. "We are confident that the Chinese economy will keep growing in a sustained and healthy way." He added that China will continue to push ahead with reforms to help sustain its growth. "The more China is developed, the more the country will open up," he said, adding that it is impossible for China to "shut the door already opened up". </body>

      <body>Germany has hit back at US criticism of its export-led growth model, describing the attack as "incomprehensible". The rebuff came after a US Treasury report said Germany's dependence on exports for growth was hurting the eurozone and the wider global economy. It also said that domestic demand growth in Germany had been "anaemic". But Germany's finance ministry said there were "no imbalances" in its economy and that its current account surplus was not a cause for concern. A surplus happens when a country's income from exports is greater than its import bill. In its report, the US Treasury said that "Germany has maintained a large current account surplus throughout the euro area financial crisis, and in 2012, Germany's nominal current account surplus was larger than that of China". Germany is the eurozone's largest economy and has been one of its key drivers of growth in recent years. Its export prowess is seen as one of its key strengths and has helped cushion the impact of the region's debt crisis on its economy. Germany narrowly avoided recession earlier this year, but GDP in the second quarter of 2013 was driven up by demand from both consumers and businesses. However, the US Treasury report said that Germany's dependence on exports coupled with slow growth in domestic demand had "hampered rebalancing" of Europe's growth. "The net result has been a deflationary bias for the euro area, as well as for the world economy," it said. Germany refuted those claims saying that its "current account surpluses are a sign of the competitiveness of the German economy and global demand for quality products from Germany". "The innovative German economy contributes significantly to global growth through exports and the import of components for finished products," a finance ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the Financial Times. </body>

      <body>UK manufacturing continued to grow strongly in October, making a "solid start" to the final quarter of the year, a closely-watched survey says. The latest Markit/CIPS Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for the sector was 56.0 last month, down slightly from September's revised figure of 56.3 but still indicating robust growth. A figure above 50 indicates expansion. The sector was helped by a rapid rise in export orders, which grew at the fastest pace since February 2011. Markit said manufacturing production and new orders grew strongly last month, leading to "further job creation". "Despite only accounting for less than 11% of the economy, the current strength of growth seen in manufacturing means the sector will still provide a major boost to the economy in October," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit. "The survey suggests manufacturing output is growing at a quarterly rate of around 1%-1.5%." Last week, official figures showed that the UK economy grew by 0.8% in the three months to September, with the manufacturing sector growing by 0.9%. </body>

      <title>Australia's small farmers struggling with low prices</title>
      <description>Despite a bumper crop of spring produce, Australia's farmers are struggling against low prices, as the BBC's Phil Mercer reports.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24610074</url>
      <date>1383179185</date>

      <body>A near-perfect growing season for small farmers in two of Australia's biggest food belt regions - south-east Queensland and Victoria - has produced a bumper crop. But despite a bountiful yield, there is a nasty sting for numerous family-run farms as oversupply has driven down prices. It should be a time for celebration for growers, who have become hardened to a relentless cycle of droughts and floods in recent years. Instead many are complaining that they are being paid less at wholesale markets than the cost of harvesting their crops. At Peak Crossing, south-west of Brisbane, Wayne Allum saw part of his 10-acre (four-hectare) property disappear under murky brown floodwaters last year, but has now enjoyed textbook weather conditions following a mild Antipodean winter. Yet still he frets about his financial future. "It's a hard game sending your stuff to the markets and then not knowing what you're going to get for it. It is stressful and disheartening," says the former truck driver, who grows tomatoes, lettuces, cabbages, courgettes, and spring onions. "Prices were terrible compared to what it costs you to grow them, get them picked, grade them, box them and send them to the markets," he adds. "I won't send my stuff to the markets any more." Instead, he sells his produce from the back of a truck parked under the shade of a jacaranda tree on the main road to take advantage of passing trade. "It's not a huge living," says Mr Allum. "I'm better off just growing what I can, do everything myself and just sell it at the farm for a profit and make a living that way." The number of farmers in Australia is shrinking, and it's not just the current domestic oversupply that is hurting the bottom line. The amount of imported fresh produce has reached record levels, and Mark Vogler, owner of the Aratula Markets in Queensland, says growers are facing unfair competition from overseas imports, which he says are of lesser standard. Mr Vogler sells fruit and vegetables from local farms and wants prices to be set by the federal government to guarantee those on the land a decent return. If not, he believes the sector will continue to contract. "To see how fast the farms are going backwards has been alarming," he adds. "The Australian public doesn't know about it yet. The problem is once we do lose the ability to feed our people locally, we'll have to rely on produce that has come in from overseas unregulated." Ausveg, the industry body representing 9,000 of Australia's vegetable and potato growers, which generates about 4bn Australian dollars ($3.8bn; £2.4bn) per year, believes that financial security for its members lies far beyond the horizon. Australian carrots are an unlikely hit in Singapore and the Middle East, along with asparagus, humble fresh potatoes and leafy greens. Last year, just 7% of Australia's fresh fruit and vegetables were exported, but Hugh Gurney from Ausveg wants that to change. "There is a lot of product entering the market, and it makes it tough for growers to get a decent price for their product," he says. "As a result the Australian vegetable industry is looking more and more to overseas markets to supply fresh produce to Asia and hopefully relieve some of the oversupply in the domestic market." Yet Australia is so big that conditions for growers vary immensely, as do the triumphs and challenges, including October's bushfires in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, where some of the worst bushfires seen in New South Wales tore across vast swathes of forest and farmland. Perched off the southern coast is the "apple isle" of Tasmania, so nicknamed because it has long produced large crops of the fruit. The island of course grows many other crops, and artisan farming has blossomed on the island state in recent years, where small enterprises beaver away making high-value, niche specialities, including hand-ground spelt rye flour along with boutique jams and relishes. Crucially, the industry has established direct links to the public, according to Jan Davis, chief executive of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association. "The thing that our small farmers do very, very well here in Tasmania is build on that relationship directly with consumers. So we've got a very strong farmers' market and farm gate sector down here," she says. Tasmanian farmers are also leading the way on exporting extensively. "We have product going right across the globe into Asia, Europe and the Americas. Just about anywhere you can think of there is Tasmanian product on a table somewhere," Jan Davis adds. But Tasmania's optimism gives way to a sense of gloom in other parts of Australia. In Queensland's sugar capital, Bundaberg, Mark Presser, a fourth generation cane farmer, enjoyed a record crop last year, and is on course to harvest another reasonable yield this time around. Yet he too feels besieged by falling prices and growing competition from overseas, most notably Brazil and India, where production costs are far less. He also complains about protectionism in Europe and the US. "Some days you wonder why you are doing it. We've got that much money tied up (in the business) we just can't walk away," says the 47-year old farmer, who owns 270 acres (110 hectares) of land. "The majority of the people who live in the big cities have got no idea at all how hard it is," he adds. He warns about the fate of other family-owned operators. "There aren't too many little ones left," he says. "They are just standing on the edge of the precipice and are on borrowed time." </body>

      <title>The self-critical boss</title>
      <description>A profile of Jeff Immelt, the boss of US giant General Electric, who says it is essential that chief executives are tough on themselves.</description>

      <body>Jeff Immelt, the boss of US giant General Electric (GE), has a simple explanation for how he has lasted so long in the top job - he is very tough on himself. "I think you can't do a job like this for a long time unless you're horribly self-critical," he says. "You have to be massively self-aware, because if you're not, it is so easy to be blind [to problems]." Mr Immelt, 57, has been chief executive and chairman of GE for 12 years, and it is a big and historic ship to steer. A huge, multi-national conglomerate, whose business interests include everything from manufacturing jet engines, to providing firms with finance, developing software, and making consumer goods such as dishwashers and coffee-makers, it has been in existence for 121 years. An American institution if there ever was one, GE was formed in 1892. Four years later it was one of the original 12 companies on the Dow Jones industrial average, the main US share index. Today GE is still on the Dow Jones. With offices and other operations in more than 160 countries around the world, GE has more than 300,000 employees, and last year it made a net profit of $13.6bn (£8.5bn) from revenues of $147bn. You might imagine that running such a successful and long-established business is a case of sticking to a safe, time-honoured course. But that couldn't be further from Mr Immelt's approach. Instead, over the past decade and a bit, Mr Immelt has worked hard to make GE leaner and more quick-footed, something he says is essential as the company continues to increase its presence in developing economies. "We were working on too many things that just weren't important, and so I launched an initiative inside the company called "simplification", which is really about lean structure, less bureaucracy, a complete passion for the market," he says. However, one man's leaner company is another person's redundancy, and Mr Immelt has cut thousands of jobs in recent years, particularly in GE's home market. This led to accusations of hypocrisy, because from February 2011 to January 2013, Mr Immelt was asked by President Barack Obama to look at how more jobs could be created in the US, in the role of chairman of the President's Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. Yet Mr Immelt says GE needs to have "a lean, simple structure", especially in terms of removing excessive management in the US and other established markets, to better focus instead on emerging nations. "The sad thing is we have great people everywhere, but it is a zero sum game," he says. "So when you have structure in the developed world that's trying to make decisions in the developing world, it just doesn't work." Regarding the issue of securing more deals in the developing world, Mr Immelt says it is something that concerns him on a daily basis, because that is where the economic growth is. "I sit in my office every day, and say, I've got to have higher market share in China than I have in the US," he says. "I've got to win Brazil, I've got to win Africa. They're not choices, I've got to, I've got to win those countries." Mr Immelt adds that when he took over the top job at GE its operations were "70% inside the United States". He says they will never be that level again "unless we are failing horribly". More than half of GE's revenues now come from overseas. With specific regard to China, Mr Immelt says it has taken "years and decades" for GE to secure the trust of the Chinese, and that as chief executive he has led from the front. "Let's say I have gone to China two or three times a year for 25 years, so I have 75 trips' worth of contacts, and I have been in hundreds of meetings," he says. Mr Immelt adds that while some meetings may be frustrating and not seem to be worthwhile, "each one adds to the one before", and you slowly build up working relationships. "We've earned the right, I think, to be a good Chinese company, only because we put in decades' worth of work." Looking ahead, Mr Immelt, who first joined GE back in 1982, and went on to head its healthcare division, says he has no plans to give up the top jobs. "In many ways I'm the same as I was 12 years ago, but in many ways just my experience and my contacts, and my ability to look around corners, and things like that, is just so vast," he says. "You can stay too long in a job, that's for sure. But by the same token, in the 12 years I have been CEO of GE there have been four CEOs of Toshiba. So there's too short a time to do it, and there's too long a time to do it." To help keep his focus firmly on the job, Mr Immelt says he leads "a relatively simple life". "I'm like one-wife, one-company," he says. "You know I don't drink much anymore. You've got to clean up a lot of elements of your life, I think, to be able to maintain the focus and the attention." And that brings us back to the self-criticism. "I worry about the 300,000 employees, and am I being a good leader? Am I being good enough?" This feature is based on an original television interview by Steve Tappin for the BBC's CEO Guru series. </body>

      <title>Leah Busque: Taskrabbit's early days</title>
      <description>Leah Busque is the founder of online errand-running business Taskrabbit.</description>

      <body>One thing many entrepreneurs have in common is the way they respond to problems they find irritating or annoying. Instead of just accepting the frustrations they encounter, they try to do something to fix the situation. The result can often be a new kind of business. For Leah Busque, founder of online errand-running business Taskrabbit, the event that caused her to start a company happened one evening when she and her husband had just called a cab to take them to meet friends for dinner. "We realised we had run out of dog food," she says. At the time the couple lived in Boston, Massachusetts, where Ms Busque worked at IBM as a software engineer. Worried that all the shops would be closed on their way home, she and her husband began discussing the problem. "My husband's also in technology, so we've always had these very geeky conversations," she says. "And that night it turned into, 'Wouldn't it be nice if there was just a place online we could go, say we needed dog food, name the price we're willing to pay?' "We were certain that there was someone in our own neighbourhood that would be willing to help us out, and it was just a matter of connecting with them." Before she left the house that evening, Ms Busque used her phone to register an internet domain name for her new business idea. A few months later, she left her job at IBM to work full time on the project. Once they've hit on what they think is a good idea, many entrepreneurs keep it to themselves, fearful that others might steal it. Leah Busque took the opposite approach. She says she talked to "anyone who would listen - family, friends, the guy sitting next to me on the bus, the person in the coffee shop, it didn't matter". She noticed that out of hundreds of conversations "no-one said, 'You're insane. This is not a good idea.' Everyone was like, 'Why doesn't this exist yet?'" Convinced there was a real potential market, she pressed on with her plan. "Ignorance is bliss, I think, when you're first starting out," she says. "I wasn't thinking about starting a company, about raising money, about hiring. I was just thinking, I have to build this idea in my head." Ms Busque began by putting an advertisement on Craigslist, an online classified advertising service, seeking people to help her try out her idea. She was surprised by the response. "I thought I would get all these college students involved that would want to make extra money… but that actually wasn't the case at all," she says. As well as students, there were enquiries from retired people and out-of-work professionals such as lawyers, pharmacists and teachers. But, Ms Busque says, the idea resonated most of all with working mothers. This group seemed not only to be interested in part-time work as errand-runners, but also in becoming customers of the service. "They were trying to balance work and life and kids, and they would love for someone to deliver their groceries or pick up the dry cleaning," Ms Busque says. For her experimental run, Ms Busque spent many hours in local coffee shops interviewing about 100 people, picking 30 of them to take part. The experience helped her later on, when she was developing a more automated vetting and background-checking system for errand-runners. Ms Busque's plan involved creating an online marketplace, where customers who wanted small tasks done could connect with people willing to carry them out. Customers would invite bids for various jobs. The company would offer guidance on pricing for many popular tasks and would take a percentage of the price paid, to cover its costs. A reputation ranking system and profiles of errand-runners would help customers to choose the right person for their job. After a successful small-scale trial, Ms Busque set about building an enterprise. A chance conversation led her to contact Scott Griffith, who was chief executive of car-sharing business Zipcar at the time. Mr Griffith liked the sound of her plans and offered her space in the Zipcar offices while she got the business off the ground. "It was an incredible opportunity," says Ms Busque. "I got to watch [Scott] run a 200-person company and grow it and scale it and raise money of his own right before my eyes." Despite this help, turning an idea into a business was not easy, particularly in late 2008 and 2009. "It was a really tough time to be raising money," says Ms Busque. "We were in a recession. Investors were not investing. And so that was incredibly stressful and took up a lot of time and energy and a lot of late nights wondering if we should continue or not." Ms Busque persisted in her efforts to find backers. A breakthrough came after she spent several weeks attending a business incubator programme in California, run by social networking giant Facebook. "It was kind of like a start-up boot camp - I just learned so much," she says. Partly through connections she made through the incubator programme, she was able to put together a round of seed-funding, so she could take her business to the next stage. It was Ms Busque's first visit to the west coast of the US, and she found the atmosphere of Silicon Valley inspiring. She decided to open a second base in San Francisco, which is where the company now has its headquarters. The firm now operates in several US cities. It is also looking to expand overseas and is planning to launch an operation in the UK soon. Taskrabbit is just one example of a player in the so-called "sharing economy", where firms attempt to use the internet to make better use of facilities that have spare capacity. Other examples include car-ride sharing firm Zimride, wi-fi access sharing business FON, and Airbnb, which enables home owners to rent out spare rooms as holiday accommodation. Compared with, say, a manufacturing business, an internet-based company might seem fairly easy to set up. It also means that online businesses might find they have more competitors than traditional ones. Certainly, Taskrabbit has not found its path to be completely smooth. In July, the company had to lose some staff. Taskrabbit has expanded from domestic errands into offering help to businesses - a field currently dominated by some huge temporary employment agencies. Ms Busque says she's not worried about competition from big players. "The temporary labour industry is one that hasn't been reinvented in decades, and so it's prime for disruption," she says. "We're really excited about tackling that market." It remains to be seen whether Leah Busque and her errand-runners are equal to the task. </body>

      <body>Swansea City made a profit of £15.3m for the year to May 2013 - the club's second season in the Premier League. The club said it has used the money to build a youth academy training facility near the Liberty Stadium and a training complex at Fairwood. The figure is up on the previous year but slightly down on the record £15.9m half yearly profits announced earlier this year. Turnover, excluding player dealings, increased by £1.9m to £67.1m. "The board is extremely pleased with the latest results and the year in general, both on and off the pitch," said Swansea's finance director, Don Keefe. "We have put the funds generated by these profits to good use with the completion of a new £6m Youth Academy training facility near the Liberty Stadium, plus an initial £5m on a new training complex at nearby Fairwood. "The club has also continued to invest in the playing squad to maintain a performance standard required for participation in the Barclays Premier League." Swansea finished ninth in the Premier League last season and won their first major trophy, the Capital One Cup, which gave them entry into this season's Europa League. Player registration costs up to the end of May increased by £8.9m to £19.1m on the previous year. The club have made a profit ever since joining the Premier League, and are building towards the future. They have submitted plans to increase the capacity of the council-owned Liberty Stadium home from 20,500 to 32,000, and work is underway on the new training facility on land acquired on lease from Swansea University. </body>

      <body>BT has said that more than two million customers are now signed up to its BT Sport TV service, which it launched in August this year to compete with Sky and boost BT revenues. BT reported six-month pre-tax profits of £948m on Thursday, a fall of 13% from the same period in 2012. New chief executive Gavin Patterson said that the sport offering had made a "confident start". BT has a £738m three-year deal to show 38 Premier League matches a season. However, initial viewer figures for some programmes were low. Speaking on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Patterson said that viewer figures were improving. "Some shows are still building audiences," he said. "The audiences we are getting for rugby were higher than Sky in the past season." When asked if the BT Sport investment was about defending its market share in broadband, Mr Patterson said: "We need to increase the revenues of the business and this is one of the ways of doing it." Claire Enders, chief executive of telecoms and media research firm Enders Analysis, said that it was a "calm and steady" set of results. "What this company wanted to achieve was a positive performance and it did that. The UK is a huge market for content and connectivity. It is the biggest in Europe," she said, adding that it was a "very positive start for the new boss". The firm previously announced it had signed up more than 500,000 subscribers - but many were existing BT broadband customers who receive the channels free after renewing their contracts. BT said profits slipped because of the sports investment. However, the company added 156,000 new broadband users in the single quarter to the end of September. That is up from 81,000 for the same period in 2012. Ms Enders said that this was due in part to a high demand for technological products from the older consumer. "The primary growth is from older demographics. The over-50s are driving up BT's broadband numbers." BT now has about seven million broadband users. </body>

      <body>Sallie Krawcheck used to be the most powerful woman on Wall Street - before two very public sackings at the height of the financial collapse. Now the head of women's networking organisation 85 Broads, she says she's grateful she was fired. From 2007-2011, Ms Krawcheck held prominent roles at banks Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. Those positions made her, arguably, the highest ranking woman on Wall Street. But, at the height of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, she had very public clashes with Vikram Pandit, the then chief executive of Citigroup, over her insistence that the bank should repay investors who had lost money using defective financial instruments that Citi had created. Eventually, she was forced out - a fate that would once again befall her, just a few years later, after taking on the role of chief executive at Merrill Lynch, a subsidiary of Bank of America. Although those firings certainly stung, they gave Ms Krawcheck an epiphany - she felt that in times of distress, companies react by closing ranks, and diversity, particularly gender diversity, suffers. "What I saw a thousand times during the downturn was, 'We'd like to give her that opportunity, but we need to go with the sure thing - we can't afford diversity right now,'" she says. So now, as the boss of 85 Broads, Ms Krawcheck says her goal is to work in a more active way to correct the gender imbalance at the top. Ms Krawcheck bought 85 Broads for an undisclosed fee from its founder, Janet Hanson, in May. Created by a group of women who worked at Goldman Sachs' former headquarters at 85 Broad Street, it was initially created to mentor women in the bank. Now, it's exploded to a membership organisation with more than 30,000 paid subscribers from 130 countries. Ms Krawcheck is candid in acknowledging that her purchase surprised many people. "For most of my career, I tried to avoid the topic of being a woman in business, vaguely concerned that talking too much about it would hold me back in some way," she wrote in a post announcing her purchase. "My standard response: 'Oh gosh, I never really think about being a woman in business. I'm just focused on getting the job done.'" However, she says her first job - as a research analyst at Solomon Brothers in the 1980s - taught her to invest in what is supported by research. And she says research shows that "women are a phenomenal investment and that is true in almost any way you can define it". Ms Krawcheck cites data showing that companies with greater diversity in senior management have higher returns, lower volatility, more innovation, greater customer focus, better stockholder returns and lower gender pay disparity. However, despite those statistics, she thinks that gender diversity - particularly in the financial services industry - has stalled, mostly as a result of the fallout from the financial crisis. "During periods of stress, it's easier for all of us to be with people like ourselves," she says about Wall Street's behaviour during that time. "But eventually it becomes a shortcut." She thinks that as a result of this impulse to push out outsiders, bad decisions can often get made. "What I saw was a good deal of groupthink [during the financial collapse]," she says. "The same people, same types of backgrounds, looking at the same data coming to the same conclusion - which in this case was wrong." During that time, she adds, she was "talked at" a couple of times - but not necessarily listened to. She says that her goal at 85 Broads is to listen to the membership to figure out ways to convince Wall Street bosses and other large organisations that gender diversity is crucial to their success - that in times of stress, instead of closing ranks, companies should look for an outsider perspective. Furthermore, she wants to expand the mission of 85 Broads to invest in companies helmed by some of its members or by other powerful women. Ms Krawcheck is candid that while her two firings helped her crystallise what she wanted to do as an executive, it certainly wasn't easy to fall so swiftly, twice. "In my mind, I sat on my sofa in my sweatpants for nine months and waited for the phone to ring," says Ms Krawcheck, about the time after she was sacked by Citigroup. But she says she is grateful for both the highs - and the lows. "I've had a lot of ups and some downs and people have asked about how I've weathered them," she says. "I know for a lot of entrepreneurs there's a sense of optimism [in being boss of your own company]. I'd say the more overwhelming emotion is one of gratitude." </body>

      <title>Europe: The fight for UK hearts and minds</title>
      <description>Big business joins battle for UK role in Europe</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24801895</url>
      <date>1383574255</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70897000/jpg/_70897590_1524742f-266d-442b-8c2b-8b523233a3f6.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>It used to be said, perhaps first by Calvin Coolidge, that: "What's good for business is good for America." In the UK the main business lobbying organisation the CBI has joined the debate about Britain's future in Europe. Its argument can be summed up as: "What's good for business is good for Britain." A lengthy study, according to the CBI's director general John Cridland, came "to the unequivocal conclusion that British business, large and small, wants to remain within a reformed EU". The CBI has produced an array of statistics concluding that membership of the EU is worth an extra 4-5% of GDP which translates into £78bn a year for the economy. That is presented as the equivalent of £1,225 per individual or £3,000 per household. The CBI wants to define the choice for the British people as "in with reform" or "out with no influence". It is a position supported by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and by David Cameron who told the CBI's annual conference that he could secure a "yes" vote in a promised referendum. The kind of reforms the CBI would be looking for would include less red tape, removing barriers to e-commerce, and ring-fencing national employment law from EU directives. Despite the CBI's enthusiasm for staying in the EU it does register unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. The CBI's intervention in this debate follows a drum-beat of statements from the business community; the first salvos in a three-year campaign to get the British people to vote "yes" to Europe. So we have had Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of financial services industry body TheCityUK saying: "I do not believe the City's pre-eminent position will survive if we lose our role as Europe's financial capital." We have had a report entitled Manufacturing: Our future in Europe which concluded that 85% of UK manufacturing firms support EU membership. Other indicators have been more cautious. There was a YouGov survey, published by the campaign group Business for Britain, which reported that - by a majority of 46% to 37% - company bosses believed that the costs of complying with the single market outweighed the benefits of staying in the EU. In October, the think tank Open Europe estimated that the top 100 EU laws cost the UK economy £27.4bn a year. So the battleground is being marked out. It is much less about a fundamental re-negotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. It is more about reforming the EU. It is the road that the rest of Europe is trying to channel the British debate down. Numerous EU leaders have made it clear that Britain will not be able to cherry pick what it likes or dislikes. There will be no tolerance of further British exceptionalism. Senior German officials have been loud and clear; they are open to reforms if they are for all 28 EU members. So David Cameron's emphasis, in recent times, has been on making the EU work better. He tried to make the recent summit about cutting red tape. He came armed with a little booklet explaining how "sweeping away barriers to growth" would "benefit all of Europe". The Commission has eagerly supported some of this agenda. They have said that 74% of Europeans believe the EU generates too much red tape. President Barroso has said the EU should be "big on big things and smaller on small things". In Brussels it is said that there was "blood on the wall" when some regulations were withdrawn by the Commission. There is a message here. The Commission is saying there is flexibility over reviewing legislation on a case-by-case basis to gauge its impact on competitiveness but the door is closed to a fundamental re-negotiation about the competences of the EU. Speaking at the CBI conference, David Cameron said: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It is a long-term strategic choice for Britain: let us reform this organisation. Let us make changes to how it works, and then let's put those changes to the British people in a referendum." He was clear that EU membership is "overwhelmingly in Britain's economic interests". So as the argument about Britain's future in Europe develops it appears less about the repatriation of powers or challenging the commitment to "ever closer union" but more about making the EU work more efficiently, with the prime minister being urged to go out and build an alliance for reform. The question is whether this kind of "reformed" EU will be enough to convince the British public, whose support for EU membership was described again by the prime minister as "wafer thin". </body>

      <title>Si Shen: Rebuilding Papaya Mobile</title>
      <description>The mobile game that survived falling off Apple's shop</description>

      <body>Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families? One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of Papaya Mobile, which produces games for mobile phones. Si Shen was born and grew up in China. Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot. Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise. When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist. But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas. Her mother's example influenced her heavily. Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. "He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.' And because of this dream, he changed the world." She remembers thinking: "That's so cool! I want to do something like that!" Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California. By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company. At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur. He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first. Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal. At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time. She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying "I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company." She got the job. After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008. They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market. After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise. At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular. Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone. The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point. "All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users." Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store. As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on. The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion. "Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.' That was a very serious situation," she remembers. "I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees. Everybody was looking at me every day. They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer." She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area. Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games. "Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone," she recalls. She was devastated. Her investors pulled out and she knew she had to do something fast. She quickly decided to take the risk of moving Papaya's games to a different mobile phone system, Google's Android platform. She took the chance because although Android was just getting established at the time, she knew "it was going to be big". Her bet paid off. Papaya's games proved popular on phones running the Android system. Later, after making some technical changes, the company's games were allowed back on sale through Apple's App Store. Ms Shen says she learnt a lot from the episode, gaining a better understanding of how the business world works and the dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket. "As a start-up, you cannot just rely on one platform, because one day if that platform tells you 'no', then you lose everything. You have to have back-up." She has also learned a lot about herself. Until then her whole business experience had been very smooth, and she had not known "the taste of failure". "That taught me that no matter what happens, if you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome." </body>

      <title>Is tide turning against German energy privatisation?</title>
      <description>Germans mull taking electricity back into public hands</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24763311</url>
      <date>1383458603</date>

      <body>Is the tide now turning against privatisation? In the 1990s, a wave of sell-offs swept away countless publicly owned enterprises (though privatisation's fans would say that "enterprise" was the wrong word to describe them). Hard-pressed governments everywhere sold power stations and electricity grids to private companies. If the taxpayer could not afford the huge bills for investment and modernisation, then why not let capitalism bear the burden - and reap the benefits? So ran the argument. But now the trend is being reversed in Germany. In a referendum in Hamburg a month ago, 51% voted to buy back the energy grid the city sold. Church groups and environmental campaigners had pushed for the official, city-wide vote - and the voters in Germany's second-biggest city responded with a "yes", albeit by the narrowest of margins. Now the capital, and Germany's biggest city, may well go the same way. Every lamp-post in Berlin seems to be plastered with posters urging the citizenry to vote for two things: One of the driving forces is a group called Energietisch, or Energy Table - an assortment of activists and different green groups who became unhappy that Vattenfall, the current provider, was not supplying enough electricity from non-coal, non-nuclear power stations. "We want to found a utility that produces renewable energy in Berlin, and we want the power grid to be brought back under public control," Energietisch says. One of the ironies of this is that Vattenfall is actually owned by a government - the Swedish government - though it does behave in the market like other, private electricity companies. Energietisch said it wanted the public authorities to get the grid back from Vattenfall because "the profits from the grid [150m euros, or £130m/$200m, last year] now go to the pockets of a Swedish nuclear and coal firm". Dr Stefan Taschner of Energietisch told the BBC that privatisation had not worked: "The consumer was promised falling prices, better quality and a more customer-oriented service but none of this was ever delivered." But there are doubters who argue that owning an electricity grid is not a sure-fire way to print money. Apart from anyone else, the city authorities are not that keen. Berlin has a debt of 60bn euros (£50bn; $80bn) and the Berlin government says that buying back the grid will only add to that - big-time. Berlin has already bought back its water supply and the city authorities fear that adding electricity would just be too big a financial undertaking. The Berlin Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) takes a similar view. Its head, Jan Eder, said: "It's a lot of money that Berlin doesn't have just lying around." But there has been a sea-change in attitudes towards public ownership in Germany. Part of the reason is that electricity prices have risen steeply to finance the switch of the country from nuclear to solar and wind power. Even Chancellor Angela Merkel, who ordered the change, called this re-engineering of the economy a "Herculean task". New wind farms are being built in the North Sea to replace closed nuclear power stations, often in the south of the country. New locations for power stations mean new routes for cables and pylons. And all that means lots of money - coming from extra on the bills of ordinary consumers. As news magazine Der Spiegel commented: "Germany's aggressive and reckless expansion of wind and solar power has come with a hefty price tag for consumers, and the costs often fall disproportionately on the poor." On top of that, rather than solar and wind replacing nuclear, it has more often been coal - and that was not the way it was meant to be. In this discontented atmosphere of rising prices and unfulfilled hopes, myriad groups across Germany have been planning to retake control of the system. According to the German association of public utilities, more than 70 new publicly run services have started in the last six years. Public operators have taken over more than 200 projects to supply energy to local people. It is what the association calls a "re-municipalisation" because, as it put it, "the idea of the state has not lived up to its promise". The citizens of Berlin will decide whether they agree. A "yes" vote would not bind the city to buy the grid back but it would force it to start preparing the way for that to happen, and it would mean a new publicly owned company offering green energy. Perhaps significantly, when the wave of privatisations of public utilities swept Germany, two cities resisted: Munich and Frankfurt, the country's two prominent hubs of capitalism. Were they right to resist a political fashion or just timid? That's what the rest of Germany is now asking. </body>

      <title>Dead daughter was chased for debts</title>
      <description>How debts are chased even after death</description>

      <body>Dealing with the financial affairs of a loved one when they die can be difficult. The probate process distributes the deceased person's property and assets. But what happens when someone leaves no assets but they do leave debts? On July 4 this year Julia and Pat Quigley's daughter Hannah took her own life. She was 45 and had battled against mental health problems for the best part of two decades. Hannah left no assets but she did have some debts with her bank and mobile phone provider. Julia Quigley says they were quick to notify EE (Everything Everywhere) and HSBC that Hannah had died, as she told Radio 4's Money Box programme: "They were phoned within three days by my son who came down from Newcastle to support us." The businesses and debt collection agencies (who were now in charge of attempting to collect the money owed) were advised that the death certificate would be forwarded to them and that the accounts should then be closed. But the letters, many of them addressed to Hannah, kept on coming asking for payment. Julia wrote back, saying that Hannah had died, enclosing the death certificate and advising that she had left no assets. But the letters continued. One from Pastdue Credit Solutions, dated October 21, said; "We will not attempt to contact you again with regards to this case number however our client may continue to contact you or pass on the account to another debt collection agency." It was nearly four months since Hannah had died, but Julia Quigley said it seemed that a resolution was still not in sight: "I was very shocked because they had been told that she'd died and I immediately called my son and he checked on the web and said, 'No, she's definitely not liable for this money'." Money adviser Nick Lord said: "Debts are only liable to be paid if they are in the name of a person but if they are in joint names there is joint and several liability." This means that debts in a sole name die with a person if they do not leave any money or assets. However, if someone has a debt with a partner and one party dies then the other party assumes liability for the debt. Debt collection guidance provided by the Office of Fair Trading clearly states that "putting undue pressure on debtors or relevant third parties is considered to be oppressive and an unfair or improper practice". It goes on to say that creditors must "ensure that accurate and adequate information is held about a borrower in relation to the provision of credit". Julia Quigley contacted Money Box to express her frustration at the treatment she had received. The programme contacted the businesses involved to ask for an explanation. EE said that the debt had initially been passed to its own debt collection department in April 2012 but had subsequently been sold to Pastdue Credit Solutions. EE has bought back the debt and closed the account: "We're sorry to hear of Ms Quigley's passing. Ms Quigley's account was first sent to debt collection on 5 April 2012. As the account was not settled, the debt was eventually sold on. As soon as Orange was made aware of the situation, we repurchased the debt and cancelled it immediately." Caroline Grant, the managing director of Pastdue Credit Solutions, has apologised for the distress caused and will donate £100 to a charity of the Quigley family's choice. She said: "I am deeply sorry to learn that an administrative error on our part has added to the distress of the late Hannah Quigley's family. The error on our part was caused by our employee closing the account under the wrong closure reason." HSBC apologised and has offered the family £500 by way of compensation and will make a donation of the same amount to a charity of the family's choice: "HSBC apologises unreservedly to the Quigley family for the insensitive and incorrect handling of Hannah's debt following her death. The failure was one of human error in not recording our collection activity as it should have been." Nearly four months after Hannah died, her financial affairs have finally been settled. Julia Quigley is relieved at the outcome: "I'm absolutely delighted and if it helps anyone in the future then that's wonderful. All the money will go to SANE." The mental health charity will receive more than £1,000. Money Box is broadcast on Saturdays at 12:00 BST on BBC Radio 4 and repeated on Sundays at 21:00 BST.

      <title>Caviar: Not just for the posh?</title>
      <description>Is caviar more than just posh nosh?</description>

      <body>The heavy set bouncers outside Ruski's Tavern would not look out of place guarding the Kremlin. The west London bar is frequented by city socialites, including Prince Harry's latest girlfriend Cressida Bonas, but for now they're making do with me. I've been seated in a red velvet-clad room in front of a platter of vodka and caviar. Owners Diego Bivero-Volpe and Antoin Commane say their caviar and vodka theme is a new concept for London. Antoin suggests that while it may currently be seen as pretentious, caviar could become as popular as lobster or champagne. He says that its image is changing, just as 20 years ago wine may have been seen as a drink for women but now appeals to all: "We think you'll see caviar soon in sandwich shops." With a platter for six people costing £66 it can work out less expensive than a gourmet burger per person - hardly the preserve of the super-rich. Matthew Du Cann, who supplies Ruski's Tavern can afford to lower his prices. He sources his eggs from around the world and the fact that the UK only eats 1.5 tonnes of caviar a year is an advantage. "We have a big HQ in Dubai and we sell to 95% of the UAE and that gives us huge buying power," he says. "Because the consumption rate is so much higher there than in the UK, we're able to offer caviar [in the UK] at 30% less than our competitors." Changes to farming methods have also played a part. Caviar is the eggs of the sturgeon. Overfishing saw it being given endangered species status in 2002 and trade in wild caviar was restricted, but since then farmers have been perfecting techniques for rearing them in captivity. Farming began in the late 1980s, but the first results were poor, with some batches described as tasting like toothpaste. Only one farm in the UK produces caviar from sturgeon. Looking out across Pat Noble's land in Exmoor you first see the massive, circular tanks, six metres in diameter, full of the fish, which tend to spend most of their time at the bottom of the tanks. One of his 10kg sturgeon will produce about 1kg of caviar. The eggs are removed and the meat is sold as food. "They're an easy fish to farm, they don't suffer many diseases, a lot of fish farmers are forever having to vaccinate their stock," says Mr Noble. "We don't have to do that with these fish and they have no chemical treatments." But he adds: "You have to keep your stock alive for seven or eight years before you get a return. That's why caviar is a relatively expensive product." If you look on your supermarket shelves you're unlikely to find sturgeon caviar, but you may find roe from the capelin, a small fish found in the Arctic. This is available in Lidl for £1.49 a jar, while tins of John West Lump Fish Caviar are sold in Tesco and Asda for £2.48. The only supermarket in which you'll find genuine caviar is in Booths, which has 29 stores in the North West of England, but sells the product in just five branches - at £40 for 30g. So how have sales been doing? Is there any evidence to suggest Antoin Commane's prediction that caviar will become mainstream is starting to come true? Not quite yet. Booths' fish buyer Matthew Bruno says they've been stocking it for six months - and it's not exactly flying off the shelves. Sales average just two tins per week. Back in the basement of the Kensington bar I'm getting a lesson in how to eat the delicacy the Russian way. I'm served a platter including caviar with chips and scrambled egg, as well as straight from the tin. They place the caviar onto the back of my hand with a mother of pearl spoon and I'm handed a shot of vodka. I'm told to lick the caviar and then take a shot of vodka as you would a tequila slammer. The eggs are about the size and colour of peppercorns, with a salty, almost nutty taste. The texture is more memorable than the taste, and while caviar can cost the same as a burger, if you're hungry go for the latter. </body>

      <title>May defends terror control system</title>
      <description>Home Secretary Theresa May insists the system for dealing with terror suspects is "strong and sustainable" despite a suspect escaping surveillance disguised in a burka.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24805294</url>

      <body>The home secretary has insisted the system for dealing with terror suspects is "strong and sustainable". It comes after a suspect, who was subject to an order restricting his movements, absconded from a London mosque disguised as a woman in a burka. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, is the second suspect under a so-called TPim order to go missing in under a year. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said changes to controls on suspects had made it easier for them to vanish. Somali-born Mr Mohamed entered the mosque in Acton, west London, in western-style clothes, but was seen on CCTV leaving with his face and body fully covered by a burka. It follows the disappearance of Ibrahim Magag in December, who absconded in a black cab after ripping off his electronic tag. Mr Mohamed, who has been linked to the Somali militant group al-Shabab, was subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPim) notice, which is aimed at protecting the public from people the home secretary believes to have engaged in terrorism-related activity but who it is not deemed feasible to prosecute or deport. Theresa May told MPs: "Even if we wanted to go back to the days of control orders, we would not be able to do so. "The powers available under control orders were being steadily eroded by the courts and the system was becoming unviable. Unlike control orders, TPims have been upheld consistently by the courts so we now have a strong and sustainable legal framework to handle terror suspects. "The police and the security services have always said that there has been no substantial risk since the introduction of TPims." Ms Cooper said the home secretary had made it easier for serious terror suspects to disappear, which was "irresponsible". "She was warned about changing the law, she was warned about weakening controls, she was warned more people would abscond and they have - twice -but still she won't act. The question on everyone's lips is how many more warnings does this home secretary need?," she said. Mrs May said Mr Mohamed's tag was thought to have be working correctly: "I have been advised that this abscond has not raised any new operational issues with the tags." Prime Minister David Cameron said TPims "do work" but when there was a problem the government needed to "act very, very quickly and get on top of it and we will". BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said what was extraordinary was that Theresa May had been entirely un-contrite about what had happened, insisting there was not going to be a return to control orders. He added that what was even more striking was the lack of a backlash from her own backbenchers. Mr Mohamed, 27, arrived at the An-Noor Masjid and Community Centre, in Church Road, Acton, at approximately 10:00 GMT on Friday, and was seen inside at 15:15 GMT. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The Counter Terrorism Command immediately launched inquiries to trace Mr Mohamed and these continue. "Ports and borders were notified with his photograph and details circulated nationally. Public safety remains our priority." Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile, the former reviewer of anti-terror laws, said: "We were assured by the government that extra money would be spent on surveillance to ensure that exactly this kind of event did not occur. "Yet the person concerned was able to walk in the front door of a mosque as a man and out through another door as a woman, on CCTV which was not seen, apparently, by the authorities." The court-approved TPim orders include a requirement that their subjects report daily to the authorities, stay overnight at a specified address, wear a GPS tag, and face restrictions on travel, movement, association and communication. They were introduced in January 2012 to replace control orders, which had been in place for seven years and also included the power to relocate suspects. When the TPims order was obtained, Mr Mohamed was said to have received terrorist training in Somalia and fought on the front line in support of al-Shabab. Court documents also say he supported a UK-based network supporting terrorist-related activity in Somalia and had been involved in attack planning against Western interests in east Africa. A spokesman for the mosque in Acton said: "The recent incident bears no semblance to the work we do as an organisation for the development of the community at large." </body>

      <title>Coulson 'never involved in hacking'</title>
      <description>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones", his barrister tells an Old Bailey jury.</description>

      <body>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones - whatever others might have been doing on his watch", an Old Bailey jury has heard. His barrister Timothy Langdale QC was speaking after the conclusion of the prosecution opening statement. He said Mr Coulson wished he had made some "different decisions" but "he did not commit these offences". Mr Coulson, 45, of Charing, Kent, denies conspiracy to hack phones. Mr Coulson, who also denies conspiracy to commit misconduct, left the newspaper industry in 2007 and went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director. He is among eight defendants, who all deny the range of charges against them. Making opening remarks, which he said was a "relatively uncommon" for a defence barrister, Mr Langdale said his client would be taking to the witness box later in the trial to give evidence about "the fast-moving world of Sunday tabloid journalism - a fiercely competitive world". He said Mr Coulson's job was "not to know about every story during the week", adding there were "many thousands of pieces of information, many of which never got in the paper at all". Reporters kept sources close to their chest, often protecting them from rivals on their own newspaper, Mr Langdale added. And he told the court that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who has a conviction for phone hacking for the News of the World and has admitted other phone-hacking charges, had targeted the phone of Mr Coulson. Mr Langdale said the case had "an unusual history" and "the trial itself will be unusually long". He also warned about "unfair reporting" of events, saying the Guardian newspaper had been wrong to say in July 2011 that News of the World journalists had deleted messages on the phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who went missing in 2002. There was no evidence to suggest Mr Mulcaire or any other person acting for the paper had deleted any message "deliberately or accidentally", he said. There was nothing the paper had done which gave rise to any "false hope" that Milly Dowler was still alive, he added. Later the court heard from the first witness, Det Sgt Gregory Smith, who investigated the phone hacking allegations. Jurors heard about a message from a recruitment firm left on the teenager's phone, a detail which became the subject of a News of the World story about her. Of the prosecution handling of the evidence, Mr Langdale said: "Their interpretation is wrong, their conclusions are wrong - there will be a time to reflect all that." Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC earlier told the court that notebooks went missing amid the "media firestorm" caused by the revelation that News of the World journalists had hacked Milly Dowler's phone. Those claims led to the closure of the paper in July 2011. Mr Edis said News International executive Rebekah Brooks and others hid evidence as police investigated the newspaper. He said security staff picked up a laptop and other material from Mrs Brooks's home in Oxfordshire, which was later found hidden in a bin bag near bins at her Chelsea Harbour flat. The court heard that, after it was hidden, a member of the security team sent a text to former security chief Mark Hanna that said: "Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Pizza delivered and the chicken is in the pot." Mrs Brooks, who was editor of the News of the World between 2000 and 2003, and her PA Cheryl Carter deny perverting the course of justice. Mrs Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, denies a second similar charge, along with her husband Charlie Brooks and Mr Hanna. She also denies conspiracy to intercept communications and conspiracy to commit misconduct. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>The mother of a teenage girl killed in a collision with a car outside her home said she kissed her daughter goodbye as she lay dead in the road. Jasmine Allsop, 14, was killed on Ann's Hill Road, Gosport, early on Sunday with her friend Olivia Lewry, 16. Police have been granted a further day to question a 20-year-old Gosport man on suspicion of murder. Rosemary Allsop said: "I told her she was my angel and I'd loved her since the day she was born." Speaking from her home, close to where Jasmine died, Ms Allsop, 37, described her daughter as "a gorgeous, lovely, bubbly character". "I kissed her - it was four hours before they took her body away because I did not want to let her go," she said. "I'm empty inside and lost. I keep expecting her to come through the door." Ms Allsop said she had gone to bed when the incident happened and was woken by the emergency services. "It was just all a blur," she said. "I cannot remember what happened. "I had gone to bed. I didn't see anything. I just thought they [Jasmine and Olivia] were playing CDs and talking about boys and make-up." She described the girls as "best friends". Jasmine died at the scene while Olivia was pronounced dead at Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth. Jasmine's father Kevin MacLaughlan, 58, also paid tribute to his daughter. He said: "I do not know how we are going to get through this. We have run out of words of comfort to say." Hampshire Police is appealing for anyone who saw the crash, near the junction of Ann's Hill Road and Brougham Street, to contact them. Officers were originally given until 19:30 GMT to question the suspect, but this has now been extended until Tuesday evening. Tributes were paid to both girls on social networking sites and friends have laid floral tributes at the scene of the crash. </body>

      <title>France releases Alps murder sketch</title>
      <description>French police release a sketch of a motorcyclist wanted in connection with the murders of four people in the Alps last year.</description>

      <body>French police have released a sketch of a motorcyclist wanted in connection with the murders of four people in the Alps last year. Three members of a British-Iraqi family and a French cyclist were shot on 5 September near Lake Annecy. Investigators say eyewitnesses saw the motorcyclist on the road leading to the murder scene. The artist's impression shows him wearing a goatee and a rare type of helmet that opens from the side. Saad al-Hilli, his wife Iqbal and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf were shot along with cyclist Sylvain Mollier on a remote forest road in Chevaline. The family's two young daughters survived the attack, one by hiding under her dead mother's skirt. Police say the helmet the motorcyclist was wearing is of particular interest as only 8,000 were made in the black or dark colour described by witnesses. It is a full-face model that opens from the side to allow for conversations, without the rider having to remove the helmet. "The only helmet on the market that matches this description is the ISR-type GPA helmet," police said in a statement. Despite checking with distributors, police have been unable to trace the owner. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris says witnesses gave a description of the motorcyclist to police in the early stages of their investigation, but the artist's impression was not released for fear the suspect would go into hiding. "This is someone who was close to the scene during a time period that interests us," a spokesman for the investigation said. Brett Martin, a British cyclist who discovered the attack, told the BBC's Panorama programme he saw a motorcyclist leaving the scene of the shooting. "He was going at a very slow, abnormally slow speed, and at the time it seemed odd," he said. A forestry worker coming down from a nearby mountain just minutes before the shooting also spoke to the programme. He said: "When I arrived, there was a motorbike pulling in to the parking area. I passed the parking and the motorbike was on the left here. "I remember it well, it was white, white and black, with panniers on either side. "The rider was all in black [and] his visor was completely closed." Police say the motorcyclist they want to speak to was on the Combre d'Ire road in Chevaline, near Annecy, between 15:15 and 15:40 local time (13:15 and 13:40 GMT) on the day of the killings. They are also looking for a right-hand drive BMW 4x4 that was spotted close to the scene. Mr al-Hilli's brother Zaid was arrested by British police in June on suspicion of planning the killings. He has protested his innocence but admits the pair had fallen out over their father's inheritance. </body>

      <body>An eight-year-old girl suffered a fatal liver injury when a boy playing British bulldog ran into her at a south-west London school, an inquest has heard. Freya James fell on to a recycled wooden railway sleeper in the playground at Trafalgar Junior School, in Twickenham, on 14 February. She suffered a liver laceration which caused internal bleeding. Freya died within three hours of the collision, West London Coroner's Court heard. She had been playing a different game when the boy ran into her while chasing another child. The impact caused her to fall - stomach and hand down - on one of the railway sleepers in the playground. The boy said he was trying to avoid a collision with another child when Freya was struck. Coroner Jeremy Chipperfield said: "There were a number of items of play equipment, furniture such as chairs, and some recycled railway sleepers. A number of staff supervise lunch play. "At about 1.15pm, there was a collision between a boy who was playing bulldog, and Freya. "As a result, she fell, and in falling struck one of the sleepers that was in the playground." Freya walked to a room to be given first aid before a paramedic and an ambulance arrived. She said she had "hurt her tummy". She was given oxygen and taken to West Middlesex University Hospital within an hour of the accident, but she died just before 16:00 that afternoon. A post-mortem examination showed injuries consistent with blunt force trauma. Mr Chipperfield added: "The conclusion was there was a liver laceration which caused internal bleeding and that resulted in Freya's death." Pathologist Dr Andreas Marnerides, of St Thomas's Hospital, who carried out the post-mortem examination, said the injuries were consistent with falling on the sleeper but added she could have suffered "the same type of trauma" if she had fallen flat on the ground. When asked if such incidents were common in playgrounds, Dr Marnerides said: "I'm not aware of the exact statistical numbers, but I've seen it before." Det Insp Andrew Dunn said the boy told police: "He was chasing a specific other boy, he was running at speed through the playground. "He swerved to avoid a collision with one other child, and ran into a young girl who he later believed to be Freya. "I have found no evidence of malice or criminal intent, and haven't submitted a file to the Crown Prosecution Service." The inquest continues. </body>

      <title>Centrica boss will not take bonus</title>
      <description>Sam Laidlaw - the boss of Centrica, which owns British Gas - says he will not take his bonus this year amid anger over energy bills.</description>

      <body>The boss of Centrica, which owns British Gas, has said he will not take his bonus this year amid anger over energy bills. Sam Laidlaw, the chief executive of Centrica, said that trust in the industry was at an "all-time low". British Gas is one of four big energy firms to raise prices for the winter, having announced a 9.2% increase from 23 November. Mr Laidlaw said bills could be cut if green levies were switched to taxation. Mr Laidlaw was speaking at the CBI annual conference in London, where he said the energy sector needed to urgently rebuild trust with consumers. As a result, he said he was not going to take a bonus. "Just to continue in this world where households are under pressure, and assume it is business as normal, is not the way thoughtful remuneration committees think about it," he said. Mr Laidlaw, who joined Centrica as chief executive in July 2006, repeated the industry's pledge to cut bills if the government moved environmental and social costs to other forms of taxation. "Those cost reductions would be immediately passed on to customers," he said. Mr Laidlaw, said the energy industry was "in the eye of the storm", conceding that firms should be more transparent, explain how bills were made up and improve the process of switching suppliers. The average dual-fuel annual British Gas bill will rise by £123 this winter. Other firms have also announced price rises. SSE announced an 8.2% increase in domestic bills from 15 November. Npower announced the biggest rise, of 10.4%, which will take effect from 1 December. Scottish Power is raising prices by 8.6% from 6 December. </body>

      <title>Living Wage rises to £7.65 an hour</title>

      <body>More than 30,000 low paid workers will receive a pay rise worth up to £400 a year after a rise in the voluntary "living wage" rate. The UK Living Wage rate, which is not binding on employers, has been increased by 20p to £7.65 an hour. It is much higher than the legal UK minimum wage of £6.31 an hour. In London, the Living Wage rate has been increased by 25p to £8.80 an hour. A total of 432 employers have signed up to pay the rate, up from 78 last year. Firms signed up to the voluntary scheme include Barclays, Oxfam, Legal and General and the National Portrait Gallery. Rhys Moore, director of the Living Wage Foundation, said the living wage had become "a must-have badge of honour for employers". "By looking out for the Living Wage badge, you can now choose to support businesses that are doing right thing. It works just like Fairtrade and will grow even faster with consumer support," he added. Dominic Johnson, employee relations director at Barclays, said paying the rate had improved retention rates for its cleaners. "Early research on the impact of the Living Wage for cleaners on Barclays' contracts shows our suppliers have a 92% retention rate versus an industry average of 35%," he said. The Living Wage is set independently each year, based on the basic cost of living in the UK. The new rates were announced at the start of Living Wage Week. Last week, Labour leader Ed Miliband said if his party won the next election, it would offer firms a 12-month tax break in 2016 if they agree to pay the living wage. </body>

      <title>'No plans' to reopen Falkirk inquiry</title>
      <description>The Labour Party has said it has no plans to reopen its investigation over vote-rigging claims in Falkirk.</description>

      <body>The Labour Party has said it has no plans to reopen its investigation over vote-rigging claims in Falkirk. It came after a former Labour chancellor added his voice to calls for a new inquiry to be carried out into the allegations. Alistair Darling said it was clear the original Labour Party inquiry "didn't have all the facts". But a spokesman for the party said it had "not seen any new evidence to justify further action". In September, Labour said it had cleared the Unite union of trying to rig the selection process for a parliamentary candidate in Falkirk. It said the decision was made after "key evidence" was "withdrawn". A Labour Party spokesman on Monday said it had re-interviewed an important witness, Lorraine Kane, following newspaper allegations. Mrs Kane had told them nothing to justify reopening the inquiry, he said. Mrs Kane and husband Michael were alleged to have had their memberships of the Labour Party paid for by Unite on the basis that they would support the union's preferred candidate for the seat. Mr Kane told the BBC on Monday: "I gave statements a while ago and that's it finished with." Asked if he changed his initial statement to the party, Mr Kane said "No. I never changed nothing." However, it was not clear whether the statement he was referring to was one in which the original allegations were made, or a subsequent statement which withdrew some of the evidence. The Labour spokesman added: "Throughout this process we have acted to uphold the integrity of the Labour Party. Throughout this we have said we will look at any new evidence which might justify the reopening of our inquiry. "That is why the General Secretary of the Labour Party approached Mrs Lorraine Kane today after reports in the Daily Mail. She said today she stands by a sworn affidavit given to us on 2nd September. "It was that affidavit which was part of the reason that led the Labour Party to conclude there was insufficient evidence to proceed with our inquiry. Therefore we have not seen any new evidence to justify further action. "There is now a police inquiry going on into other issues around Falkirk and we will of course consider the outcome of that inquiry." Speaking earlier on Monday, Mr Darling told BBC Scotland he believed something had "gone very wrong in Falkirk" and there "needed to be a thorough investigation". He said: "I understand the police are looking at it now. If the police decide to proceed they will send a report to the procurator fiscal and then it goes through the criminal justice system. "If the police for whatever reason decide they are not doing it then there needs to be a proper inquiry, one that people have confidence in, people can see what happened. "Its results need to be published so that people can see exactly what happened and to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. It has got no place in politics. "I think the problem with the last report was quite clearly it didn't have all the facts that are now available." Several Labour councillors in Falkirk have told the BBC that Ed Miliband must now publish the party's report on the affair or re-investigate what happened. The leader of the Scottish Labour Party had earlier said the inquiry may have to be reopened. Johann Lamont told the BBC "we certainly have to look at that" because of concerns the investigation "wasn't entirely complete". But Ms Lamont said there were no plans to make the original inquiry's report public. At the weekend it was revealed that Stephen Deans, the chairman of Falkirk Labour Party, intended to stand down from his post. Mr Deans, who had been a full time Unite official at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant, had been accused of being involved in vote-rigging in Falkirk, but was later cleared by Labour's internal investigation. Ms Lamont was asked by presenter Gary Robertson whether she had spoken to Mr Deans. She responded: "I didn't believe it appropriate for me to speak to Stevie Deans. "What I am very clear - this is about a situation that is entirely unacceptable for the Labour Party that we have presumed through the selection process that if you can get selected, we presumed that voters will come with us afterwards - that is entirely the wrong message." The Sunday Times said it had seen 1,000 emails to and from Mr Deans, which it said revealed the full extent of the plot to influence the selection process. Its story also included extracts of the internal Labour report in which Labour officials said there were "deliberate attempts to frustrate" interviews with some of the key witnesses. The emails suggested that a letter retracting key evidence in the Labour investigation was not written by the witnesses but by union officials and approved by Mr Deans, according to the Sunday Times. Police in Scotland, who earlier this year dropped an investigation into the Falkirk allegations, are studying the leaked emails. </body>

      <body>A disturbance at a Kent prison happened after inmates were put on "lockdown" at short notice, the Prison Officers' Association (POA) has said. Disorder broke out at the Category C Maidstone prison on Saturday, which houses only foreign nationals. Ralph Valerio, of the POA said, "The offenders were told they would not get out to have association in the afternoon." The Prison Service said there were no injuries or damage caused. Mr Valerio said inmates objected to the last-minute change to their routine. "The prisoners expected certain things to happen," he said. "Because there was less staff available, that then meant very quickly they were going to be locked down." The Prison Service said all accommodation at the prison was back in use on Sunday, after the disturbance was dealt with by 18:30 GMT on Saturday. Mark Reckless, Conservative MP for Rochester and Strood, and a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee, said: "It was a change in when they came out of their cells, rather than the amount of time they came out of their cells. "When the government had been looking at making savings in the Prison Service by privatising some prisons, the governors and Prison Officers' Association, I understand, came to [the justice secretary] with alternative methods of finding savings, one of which was making time out of the cells into one longer period, rather than more numerous, shorter periods." A Prison Service spokesman said its jails run a "safe and secure regime" with an appropriate level of staffing. "We are currently introducing reforms to the prison system that will provide better value for taxpayers while protecting the public and improving the chances of prisoners being rehabilitated," he said. Until this summer, the Category C prison held a mix of foreign nationals and sex offenders, but now holds only foreign nationals. </body>

      <body>British soldiers killed by two members of the Afghan police force had been posing for pictures with their suspected killers shortly before the attack, an inquest has heard. Cpl Brent McCarthy, 25, and L/Cpl Lee Davies, 27, were killed in the attack on 12 May 2012. They had been part of a British Army patrol advising and training Afghan forces at a base in Helmand province. The inquest was told there had not been a bad atmosphere before the shooting. Several photographs were shown at the inquest at Oxfordshire Coroners Court, including one of Cpl McCarthy, from Telford, Shropshire, with one of the police officers and another showing both Afghans posing with their AK47 rifles. The British patrol had gone to the police base in the Lashkar district to meet local police officials. Cpl McCarthy, who was an RAF policeman, was acting as a specialist adviser. However, a short while after the patrol arrived, there was a burst of gunfire that left both Cpl McCarthy and L/Cpl Davies - who was born in Carmarthen and grew up in Cardigan - fatally injured. Both were quickly evacuated but were later pronounced dead. The two suspected killers were seen running out of the base's main gate and across fields by another British soldier who managed to shoot at one of them. Guardsman Joshua Foley, of the Welsh Guards, said the training group had had a "good relationship" with the Afghans but when they arrived that afternoon a new local police force had moved onto the base and there were several unfamiliar faces. When asked by the coroner for Oxfordshire, Darren Salter, whether he had picked up on any warning signs of any heightened risk of a possible attack by the Afghan forces, Guardsman Foley said the so-called atmospherics had been "fine". As he stood with L/Cpl Davies, who was a member of the 1st battalion Welsh Guards, and Cpl McCarthy, two Afghan policemen passed them near the main entrance to the base and there was an attempt by the British soldiers to strike up some "banter". "We tried to have a laugh with them but they didn't seem to get it," Guardsman Foley told the coroner. However, the soldiers then produced a camera and the Afghans agreed to have some photos taken, including with Cpl McCarthy and Guardsman Foley. Guardsman Foley described how L/Cpl Davies then made a disparaging comment about one of the Afghans to him. Guardsman Foley did say, though, that he did not think either of the Afghans heard the comment and pointed out they seemed to understand very little, if any, English. He then left Cpl McCarthy and L/Cpl Davies with the police officers to take up duty in one of the base's guard towers. "I heard a rapid burst of shots, and as I looked I saw the two Afghan police holding their weapons and L/Cpl Davies was lying back," Guardsman Foley said. "I did not see the Afghan police fire any shots but they both ran out of the main entrance." He was asked if the two men he saw running from the base were the same two he had been with shortly before, and he confirmed they were. </body>

      <title>Business not 'the enemy', CBI says</title>
      <description>CBI president Sir Mike Rake says business is suffering a crisis in public confidence, with some people seeing it as the "enemy".</description>

      <body>Business is suffering a crisis in public confidence, the president of the CBI employers' group has said. Sir Mike Rake told the organisation's annual conference in London that business was seen by some people as the "enemy". But the truth was that the UK would only thrive with successful, productive businesses of all sizes, he said. "We want to be, we can be, and we are partners in building prosperity," he said. "Some of the rhetoric we've heard recently suggests that business is somehow the enemy - we are not, and this could not be further from the truth. "Business is undoubtedly suffering a crisis in public confidence - as we have seen in banking, and now in the current debate around energy." Recent prices rise by energy suppliers sparked calls for price controls, windfall taxes, and an investigation into whether the market was working efficiently. But Sir Mike, chairman of BT, said "over simplistic" statements just played to the public gallery. "But they will not address the complex problems that need to be resolved - indeed, they are very likely to have the opposite effect." Transforming the energy market will be costly, he warned, adding: "The obvious issue is how to balance long-term investment with the short-term pressures on household budgets. "People are of course concerned about rising prices. They feel, rightly or wrongly, that they're being unfairly treated. "There are no easy answers, but the public deserves better than politicians playing the blame game," he said. The CBI president criticised the "commercially harmful" indecision over HS2 and urged politicians to stick to long-term infrastructure decisions. "Vision and implementation are the answers to many of the UK's perennial challenges on transport: Road, rail and air, and energy. A co-ordinated plan for making this happen is essential," he said. The delivery of some big projects on the ground "is just not happening", he warned. "Political indecision is commercially harmful - delivery has got to be ramped up." </body>

      <title>Men and boys 'organised sex abuse'</title>
      <description>A gang of eight men and teenagers, two of them only 14, "controlled" the sexual abuse of five girls aged 12 and 13, a court hears.</description>

      <body>A gang of four men and four teenage boys "organised and controlled" the sexual abuse of five girls aged between 12 and 13, a court has been told. The case came to light when one of the alleged victims was taken into care and told her social worker she had been abused, jurors at the Old Bailey heard. She and the other four complainants come from Peterborough. The gang, who all lived at addresses in the city, deny a total of 57 counts of abuse, including rape. Zdeno Mirga, 18, his brother Dusan, 20; Hassan Abdulla, 32; David Ziga, 19; two 17-year-old boys and two 14-year-old boys are on trial. The alleged abuse happened between April and December last year. One of the girls, a 13-year-old known as "Victim A", said she was raped in a park in the town and made to have sex with several other men in the following months. The court was told the girl had severe learning difficulties. She described Zdeno Mirga, known as "Skinny", as the gang's boss, prosecutor Angela Rafferty said. "He encouraged her, often very forcefully indeed, to give other boys and men... sex. "He did this using the power he had over her at the time, or threatened her and sometimes he used violence against her. "Skinny took her to parties where she was shared around sexually," Ms Rafferty added. The girl told police that Zdeno Mirga "shared" her because he wanted money to buy cannabis and vodka, the court heard. Ms Rafferty said some of the defendants were "more heavily involved than others". "Some organised and controlled the sexual activity, some took a spur-of-the-moment decision to become involved," she said. Jurors were warned they would hear "very graphic descriptions" of what allegedly happened to the girls, and they would have to put their emotions and sympathies to one side during the trial. The case continues. </body>

      <title>Not reporting abuse 'must be crime'</title>
      <description>Teachers and other professionals who fail to report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the former director of public prosecutions says.</description>

      <body>Teachers and other professionals who do not report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the ex-director of public prosecutions says. Keir Starmer said under a British "mandatory reporting" law, those who failed to act could be sent to jail. Declassified files uncovered by BBC Panorama show how schools have repeatedly failed to protect children from sex offenders. But the government said mandatory reporting was not the answer. While statutory guidance has been issued previously urging professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report child abuse, failure to do so is not a crime in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1967 makes it an offence to fail to disclose an arrestable offence - including those against children - to police. Mr Starmer, who was succeeded as director of public prosecutions by Alison Saunders on Friday, said it was time to "plug a gap in the law" that had been there for a "very, very long time". "If you're in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, and you have cause to believe that a child has been abused, or is about to be abused, you really ought to do something about it," he said. He said a criminal penalty would "focus people's minds" and said there should be "immunity for individuals if they did report". He said the penalty for failing to report abuse could be a short jail sentence or a fine. "There are just too many examples of cases where those who have suspected abuse have not really done anything about it and the perpetrator has either got away with it or, worse still, been able to perpetuate the offending." He added: "I would have a reasonably broad category of individuals that were subject to the law. "Obviously school teachers, but others in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, including other educational institutions, even sporting institutions." Similar laws are already in places in countries including the US, Canada and Australia. For the first time, the Catholic Church and the Church of England have also come out in support of mandatory reporting. Bishop Paul Butler, head of safeguarding at the Church of England, said: "We have to think of the child first, not ourselves, not the institution, what's best for the child." But the government has no plans to change the law. The Department for Education said professionals "should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child". "This happens every year in many thousands of cases and numbers of referrals have increased over recent years," it added. "Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children." And Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the Action for Children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are not convinced that making it mandatory will do what we need it to do." She said the reporting of child abuse in the UK was on the rise and that a "huge issue" was that "teachers and people across the system are not sufficiently trained to see those early signs of abuse". It was important they knew how to spot those signs "and not to feel that they may be prosecuted if they don't", she added. But Jonathan West, of the Mandate Now coalition of charities, welcomed Mr Starmer's call, adding that "social services can't actually act on cases they haven't been told about". He added: "Schools, other organisations, often don't really want to have a child abuse scandal on their hands. "It is surprisingly common that schools want to handle such things in house." Ever since the Jimmy Savile revelations, Panorama has been investigating secret historical records and looking at what government officials knew about abuse in children's homes and boarding schools. Declassified government files going back 60 years show how senior civil servants were well aware that school authorities routinely hid child abuse - preferring instead to protect the reputation of their own institutions - and the law was an inadequate deterrent. One of the most detailed historical files in the National Archives is about a cover-up at the Royal Alexandra and Albert school. Today it is a well-regarded state boarding school in Reigate, Surrey. However, research by Panorama has revealed that seven child abusers worked at the school between the 1950s and the 1980s.

      <body>A Swansea woman who broke her six-week-old daughter's legs has been given a three-year supervision order. The city's crown court heard that the woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, admitted assaulting the baby three times late last year. Her barrister said his client was suffering from post natal depression. The court previously heard how she twisted her daughter's legs until her knees broke, and the baby suffered multiple fractures. The woman admitted assaulting the baby three times within the first six weeks of her life. Dean Pulling, prosecuting, said when police went to her house they struggled to get the baby away from the woman, who was drunk. John Hipkin, defending, said she suffered from post natal depression and would not have harmed the child if she had been well. </body>

      <body>A man has been jailed for shaking his 10 week-old daughter to death because she would not stop crying. Kurt Delves, 22, of Regan Crescent, Birmingham, repeatedly shook Harli Reid "in frustration" causing devastating brain injuries. He has been jailed for three years and nine months, having admitted manslaughter last month. Police said he had claimed he splashed water in her face while bathing her and she flinched and became "floppy". Delves said he shook her lightly in an attempt to wake her when it happened, on 17 December 2010. Harli was put on life support at Birmingham Children's Hospital but died the following day, police said. Birmingham Crown Court heard that Delves, Harli and her mother had been out shopping together on the day she died. Delves later took Harli to her mother's flat at Grafton Court in Erdington where he "violently and unlawfully" shook the baby, prosecutor Andrew Smith QC said. There were inconsistencies in his account about when he bathed her, Mr Smith said. Harli suffered significant brain damage and haemorrhages in her brain and eyes. Judge Mrs Justice Thirlwall told Delves: "Babies are vulnerable and defenceless. "They can often be noisy, they can often be demanding, they are always vulnerable. "It is the fundamental duty of a parent to protect them and this you failed. "I accept you wanted to be a good father but on this date, you didn't, you lost your temper, you shook her repeatedly, "She has lost her life, a mother has lost her baby and her grandparents, including your own mother, have lost a granddaughter. Her brother will never know her." Defending, Timothy Wraggatt QC highlighted Delves guilty plea and said he would always have to live with what he had done. Delves pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the first day of his trial. </body>

      <title>HS2 opponents risk UK's future - PM</title>
      <description>Opponents of the HS2 rail link are "putting our country's future at risk", Prime Minister David Cameron tells the CBI annual conference.</description>

      <body>Opponents of the HS2 rail link are "putting our country's future at risk", Prime Minister David Cameron has said. He spoke at the CBI annual conference after speculation that Labour would withdraw its support for the high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will say Labour's support is "not at any cost". Mr Cameron also said the new boss of HS2 would find ways to cut the estimated £50bn cost of the scheme. He said Sir David Higgins would "make absolutely sure we drive every extra bit of cost out of this that we can, so it comes in under the budget that's been set". "I want to make sure we get every penny of value for money from this HS2 investment," he said. "I think it is fantastic that Sir David Higgins - the man who built the Olympics on time and on budget - is going to be running HS2." He added: "People who are against it, in my view, are putting our country's future at risk, they are putting the future of the North of England at risk," he said. "We need to have a concerted consensus across business, across politics, that we get behind these large infrastructure projects." He said making the investment would "make sure our economy shares growth between the north and south - it will link eight of our 10 biggest cities". Sir David has said he believes the scheme can come in "substantially" under the current budget if the £14bn set aside for contingency costs is reduced. Mr Balls, meanwhile, told the conference: "The Labour Party cannot - and will not - give the government a blank cheque." "That is what you would expect from any credible official opposition seeing a government desperately mismanaging a project. And that is what is happening here with the costs having shot up to £50bn. "We will put the national interest and the taxpayer interest first. "We will take a hard-headed look at the costs and benefits of the scheme to ensure this is the best way to spend £50bn for the future of our country." He said a Labour government would set up an independent infrastructure commission to end delays in major infrastructure projects. In his speech, CBI president Sir Mike Rake criticised "commercially harmful" indecision over HS2. "We cannot have every major infrastructure decision continuously redebated at every turn, as we're seeing with HS2," he told the conference. "Undoubtedly, a better effort should be made to communicate the benefits of high speed rail, and this must be positioned within an overall, long-term strategy of what the country needs across all modes of transport. "Decisions have to be made, and once they have been made then we should stick to them." MPs last week approved funding to prepare for the high-speed rail network. The HS2 project would see lines built between Birmingham and London, followed by a V-shaped second phase building separate tracks from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. The government hopes to begin construction on the first phase of HS2 in 2017 and open that part of the line in 2026. The additional lines to Leeds and Manchester could then be completed by 2032-33. </body>

      <title>Downton Abbey 'can help UK business'</title>
      <description>The popularity of the Royal Family and the TV drama Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers are told.</description>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <body>A daughter of Jean McConville has spoken for the first time in a BBC documentary about the IRA's abduction and murder of her mother. The programme about the Disappeared also hears denials from Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams that he ordered the disappearance of Mrs McConville. The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles. Mrs McConville's body was found at a beach in County Louth in 2003. One of her 10 children, Agnes, described her mother's abduction, which happened in 1972. "We could hear her squealing, still squealing and looked over at the banister on Divis Flats (in west Belfast) and there she was getting thrown into the back of a van," she said. "That was the last time that we saw her." Agnes' brother Michael also recalled seeing his widowed mother being taken away. "All of us were just wrapped around her, all crying and squealing," he said. "I remember one of the girls (who abducted her) talking, who I knew because she hadn't got a mask on, she used to be a neighbour of ours, her and her sister were there. "They kept trying to calm us down, because they knew us and they knew us by name." In the programme, Mr Adams is asked about allegations that he ordered the murder of Mrs McConville. He is also asked about his knowledge of the fate of two IRA men who also disappeared the same year. "No, I had no act or part to play in either the abduction, the killing or the burial of Jean McConville or indeed any of these other individuals," he said. "My focus is in trying to do what I can as an individual to bring those remaining bodies to the families who grieve them, who want a burial place to go to. "Of course I regret, one wouldn't be a thinking, living human being if one didn't have regrets. All of us bear a responsibility, those of us who are in leadership, and I've never shirked that." Although the remains of some of the Disappeared have been recovered, seven have never been found. One of them is Columba McVeigh, a 19-year-old from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1975. His sister, Dympna, told the programme: "I never did anything to the IRA, neither did my mum, so why are they torturing us? Thirty-eight years on and they're still torturing us and that's what it is. How would you feel if it was your brother? "I've got an image in my head of Columba standing there crying, looking into a hole. Nobody got to say goodbye to him." The first of the Disappeared to be found was north Belfast man Eamon Molloy, who was 21 when he was abducted and murdered in 1975. His body was discovered in a coffin left at Faughart graveyard near Dundalk, County Louth, in 1999. Mr Molloy's brother Martin told the documentary-makers a priest had told the family of Eamon's final moments. The Disappeared is shown at 22:35 GMT on Monday 4 November on BBC One Northern Ireland, and at 22:00 GMT on Tuesday 5 November on BBC Four.

      <body>The Army has defused a bomb during a security alert in Ardoyne, north Belfast. The alert began in Jamaica Street on Monday afternoon. Local people told the BBC that an object was thrown at two men in the street at around 14:30 GMT. A PSNI spokesman said the "small viable device" was made safe by the Army and taken away for further examination. During the operation police used a remotely controlled drone to carry out an aerial search of the area. It is the first time that the PSNI has deployed a drone since the G8 summit in County Fermanagh in June. A number of houses in Jamaica Street were evacuated during the alert and part of the road was sealed off. Residents have now been allowed to return to their homes and traffic restrictions have been lifted. A PSNI statement said "a limited aerial capability was required" during the Ardoyne alert "in order to keep the community, police and Army officers safe". "The police service obtained approval to purchase Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) earlier this year," the statement added. "These systems are flown in accordance with Civil Aviation Authority approval." The drones that the PSNI use are small aircraft, with a maximum wingspan of around 10ft. They are operated by a member of PSNI Air Support Unit who has undertaken CAA-approved training and who remains in line of sight of the drone. The drones can be used by the police to help traffic management, searches for missing or wanted people, public order situations and for evidence gathering. As the alert ended on Monday evening, a PSNI spokesperson said: " The use of an Unmanned Aerial System assisted in this clearance operation and minimised disruption to the local community by bringing the incident to a safe and satisfactory conclusion." </body>

      <body>An aluminium plant in Caerphilly county could close with the loss of 132 jobs. Sapa Extrusions has begun a consultation with employees at the factory in Bedwas, which has been operating since 1971. The firm blamed "significant changes" in market conditions in the past few years and said it needed to stay competitive. Sapa said it would work to provide opportunities for future employment for staff if the plant was to close. Alan Couturier, managing director of Sapa UK, said: "In light of the change to market conditions, our commitment to continue manufacturing in the UK remains strong. "We believe that there is a need in the UK for a quality producer that can provide a level of service exceeding current customer expectations. "Achievement of this goal is paramount in our future strategy. "We recognise the impact that this announcement will have on our colleagues at Bedwas. "We very much hope that we can find alternatives to the proposal to close and will put every effort into doing so." Jeff Woods, Wales officer for the Unite trade union, said the announcement was a "body blow" to the workforce. He added: "If the jobs were to go at the site this would not only hit those directly involved but harm the local community and Welsh economy. "Going forward we will be doing all we can to prevent any job losses and the damage this will do locally. We call on all relevant parties to work with us in this aim." </body>

      <body>A clean-up operation is under way after huge waves damaged Aberystwyth seafront and dumped shingle on the promenade during the weekend's storms. Local photographer Keith Morris said the scene resembled a war zone on Sunday morning with some seafront businesses hit by flooding. Wales battled winds of 89mph (143kph) at the storm's height on Saturday. Gusts brought down trees and power lines leaving 10,000 properties across south and west Wales without power. "I have not seen a storm as big as that for decades in Aberystwyth," said Mr Morris. "There were big granite blocks lifted feet into the air. It did look a bit like a war zone on Sunday morning. "The power of the waves was astounding. "One huge wave floored me," said Mr Morris who lost a £4,000 camera while trying to capture the dramatic scenes. "I'm lucky to be alive - it could have dragged me into the ocean." On the resort's seafront tonnes of stones have been deposited by the waves and part of the sea defences have been damaged. Ceredigion council workers were involved in the clean-up with wheelbarrows and shovels. And some seafront businesses including a hotel and gym are said to have suffered basement flooding. Elsewhere, the storms brought down trees and power lines as engineers worked into Sunday to restore power to everyone affected in south and west Wales. The highest wind speed was 89mph recorded at Mumbles head near Swansea on Saturday at 16:00 GMT. Carmarthenshire council says workers have also been helping with a clean-up across the county with damage to properties and parks due to fallen trees and water. A tree came down on to a roof at the Carmarthenshire County Museum in Abergwili, and a water main burst at Inkerman Street, Llanelli. The Met Office recorded strong gusts on coasts around Wales from the Bristol Channel to the Llyn Peninsula in north Wales. South Wales Police received reports of 13 fallen trees in one hour on Saturday afternoon. On Monday, one flood alert remained in place for Swansea Bay and the Gower peninsula coast, according to Natural Resources Wales (NRW). </body>

      <body>Glasgow 2014 organisers say they have sold 92% of the Commonwealth Games tickets that were available to the public for next summer's event. The remaining 76,000 tickets go on sale to the general public on Tuesday. They cover limited sessions and price categories in badminton, boxing, lawn bowls, rugby sevens, weightlifting and para-sport powerlifting and squash. During the initial four-week window, there were 2.3 million requests for one million tickets then available. Since then, applicants who were unlucky in the first ballot were given first refusal in the second round of tickets to go on sale, then all applicants could apply for more. Of the sales so far, 57% have been bought by people living in Scotland, 40% from other parts of the United Kingdom and the remainder from non-Commonwealth countries. Tickets to Commonwealth nations are from an additional pot, sold through the various Commonwealth Games around the world. Overall, 70% of the Glasgow 2014 tickets were made available to the public, while organisers reserved 9% for the Commonwealth Games associations and the Commonwealth Games Federation. Sponsors and broadcast partners accounted for 8% and 7% of the tickets respectively, while one ticket in 20 was retained for "contingency" and 1% reserved for Games partners. </body>

      <title>Charity gets Philpott demolition fee</title>
      <description>The £18,000 fee for demolishing a Derby house in which six children were killed in a fire is given to a charity helping disadvantaged children.</description>

      <body>A charity has received £18,000 from the demolition company that knocked down a house in which six children died. Derby Demolition Ltd waived its fee for razing 18 Victory Road where the children of Mick and Mairead Philpott lost their lives in a fire. The couple were jailed in April, along with friend Paul Mosley, after being convicted of manslaughter. The money will go to a Skegness holiday home for disadvantaged children living in Derbyshire. Bill Tomlinson, chairman of the Derbyshire Children's Holiday Centre, said it was a "phenomenal fee". He said: "It's our intention for the money to be used for the children in the Victory Road area." The donation, he said, was a "magnificent gesture". The cheque was presented at a community centre run by the Osmaston Community Association of Residents. Mr Tomlinson said it would pay for almost five weeks of holiday for disadvantaged children. Daniel Walsh, of Derby Demolition, said he wanted the money to go to the centre, in Skegness, Lincolnshire, because he had visited it as a child. He said: "In these times all money is welcome but we thought it would do more good for somebody else and for some good to come of the situation." Mr Walsh added that he and his staff had found the job difficult knowing what had happened at the property. He said: "We all thought it was going to be a bit gory. We never went into the Philpotts' house and we sort of just pulled it down as it was, so nobody was actually physically handling anything." Jade Philpott, 10, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six, and Jayden, five, died on the morning of the fire at Victory Road, on 11 May 2012. Mairead Philpott's son from a previous relationship, 13-year-old Duwayne, died later in hospital. Mick Philpott, 56, was jailed for life, with a minimum sentence of 15 years, for starting the fire while his children slept upstairs. </body>

      <body>A 35-year-old man who went on the run with a 14-year-old girl he lured away from her foster parent carers in South Yorkshire, has been jailed. John Bush, of Moss Road in Askern, Doncaster, disappeared with the girl, who cannot be named, on 10 June. A nationwide police hunt was launched after the teenager went missing. Police eventually found the pair near Euston Station in London. Bush admitted sexual activity with a child and child abduction and was jailed for six years. He was jailed at Sheffield Crown Court by a judge who said he believed Bush - a convicted fraudster - was at least partly motivated by sex. Sarah Wright, prosecuting, said Bush took the girl from her foster parents. Police found the pair had exchanged 250 text messages in three days in June. Judge Paul Watson said Bush's action had left many members of the girl's family deeply worried. He said: "She was a vulnerable little girl leading a chaotic lifestyle, through no fault of her own. "At a time when she needed stability and guidance in her life, you took her away from the people responsible for providing that for her." But Nicholas De La Poer, defending, said the girl's mother knew where she was and was in regular contact with her daughter "whatever she was saying publicly". Bush, he added, was "making it up as he went along" and "living off his wits". The court heard the pair left Doncaster together, heading first to Pontefract in West Yorkshire and then to Melton Mowbray in Leicestershire. At a pub in the village of Sproxton, Bush used a "sob story" to con a landlord into giving them rooms but left the next day without paying. After going to Peterborough they went to London and were spotted by a British Transport Police officer and Bush was arrested. Bush called out to the girl and said "it's over". </body>

      <title>Change head injury rules, urge unions</title>
      <description>Footballers should be removed from the field of play if they lose consciousness, say two of football's player unions.</description>

      <body>Footballers should be removed from play if they lose consciousness, say the world players' union Fifpro and the Professional Footballers' Association. Tottenham keeper Hugo Lloris was allowed to carry on after being knocked out in Sunday's 0-0 draw with Everton. "If anyone suffers severe trauma to the head and loses consciousness, they should be required to leave the field," said the PFA's John Bramall. The Football Association says a player can continue if assessed by a doctor. Lloris briefly lost consciousness after colliding with striker Romelu Lukaku late on in the match at Goodison Park and was assessed on the pitch before continuing. Spurs manager Andre Villas-Boas said he believed Lloris looked capable of continuing and the French international later underwent a CT scan, showing no signs of concussion. "This decision is unacceptable," said Fifpro medical advisor Vincent Gouttebarge. "Fifpro condemns that the health and safety of players are left to coaches, trainers or even to players themselves. "Medical professionals should be aware of any relevant medical guidelines and apply them in order to empower the health and safety on the field." Fifpro urged all clubs to follow guidelines laid out by sport medicine groups in Zurich last year, which called for the removal of a player from the field if they were showing a loss of consciousness. Fifa's chief medical officer, Professor Jiri Dvorak, also said Lloris should have been substituted, in accordance with the world governing body's guidelines. "The decision was not right," added Dvorak. "We have a very clear recommendation for doctors if concussion occurs or even if there is a strong suspicion of concussion then the player should be taken out of the play. "This injury could have led to more severe complications." Bramall added: "It is important to take the pressure off the players, club medical staff, and the manager - removing the need for them to make a very difficult decision. "The PFA will continue to work with the stakeholders within the game, to evaluate what guidelines are currently in place and to see if and how they need to be improved." In rugby union, Dr Barry O'Driscoll resigned from his role as medical advisor to the International Rugby Board in October following concerns about the treatment of concussion. </body>

      <body>Zak Hardaker has withdrawn from England's Rugby League World Cup squad because of "personal issues". The Leeds Rhinos full-back, 22, is the second player to exit Steve McNamara's squad after Salford's Gareth Hock was thrown out for disciplinary reasons. Hardaker was not chosen for either of England's first two tournament matches. An England Rugby League statement read: "Due to personal issues, Zak Hardaker is unable to commit to the England Rugby League programme." It continued: "He has informed the England RL management team that he wishes to withdraw from the squad and will not play any further part in Rugby League World Cup 2013. No replacement has been called up. "England Rugby League will work with Zak's club, Leeds Rhinos, to support him during this period." McNamara cited illness as the reason for Hardaker's absence on Saturday. When asked if he was being punished for a breach of discipline, McNamara said: "Absolutely not." Former Leeds, Great Britain and England player Keith Senior told BBC Look North that it was a "massive disappointment" for Hardaker that he was no longer involved in the World Cup. "Hopefully he will get through his troubles because he has great potential and he has a very big future," added 37-year-old Senior. Second-rower Hock confirmed his own removal came after he and some team-mates went on a night out after England's surprise defeat by Italy before oversleeping the next morning and missing a recovery session. Former captain James Graham was also left out of England's squad for their opening match against Australia, with McNamara walking out of a pre-match media conference when asked by journalists about the player's absence. </body>

      <title>Facebook beheading: Who was the woman?</title>
      <description>A film of a woman being beheaded in Mexico caused an international outcry when Facebook refused to remove the offending footage from its site. Why has no-one identified the victim?</description>

      <body>A film of a woman being beheaded in Mexico caused an international outcry in October when Facebook refused to remove it from its site. There have been hundreds of reports about the video - but why has no-one identified the victim in it? In the grainy footage, the woman is on her knees in jeans and a pink top, before a masked man holding a knife behind her says in a gruff voice: "Well, gentleman, this is what happens to all those in the Gulf Cartel. On behalf of Los Zetas." The rest of the video is a gruesome 40 seconds of cold-blooded murder, which caused international controversy recently when it was posted on Facebook. "Irresponsible" was the word used by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, about the social network's policy permitting the video to be uploaded. After a day or so of impassioned debate on both sides, Facebook reversed its decision and took the video down. Needless to say, it is still easy enough to find online, especially in Mexico. There are numerous websites dedicated to uploading videos of "narco-killings" or executions similar to the Facebook example. Yet despite the fact the victim is clearly identifiable and that presumably someone somewhere in Mexico must recognise her - as their wife, daughter or sister - no-one has come forward to name her. As far as the BBC has been able to ascertain, there is no investigation under way in Mexico to establish the woman's identity, or find the culprits of her murder. "The place to start [such an investigation] is with the municipal police," says Dr George Grayson, one of world's authorities on Los Zetas and author of the book, The Executioner's Men, about the criminal organisation. The problem, he says, is that although many municipal police officers may work for the public during the day - and sometimes even that is questionable - at night they work for the cartel. As such, he says, fear is a powerful tool used by both the Zetas and their rivals. "People are reluctant to report crimes, even heinous crimes. State forces are not much better in terms of their corruption and their collaboration with the cartels." Meanwhile, the unfortunate lady in the controversial film continues to be nameless and with no known identity - a "Jane Doe", reminiscent of dozens, perhaps hundreds of others who met a grisly end on camera in Mexico. In the case of the Facebook victim, one is faced with an even more basic problem when trying to identify her. Based on the non-descript wasteland in the video clip, it is almost impossible to establish where in Mexico she was killed and therefore which local authorities are responsible for investigating her murder. In essence, the act could have happened almost anywhere in the country where there is drug-related violence. Los Zetas' and Gulf Cartel's areas of influence, Oct 2013 QandA: Mexico's drug-related violence Stratfor: Cartel influence map "This gets to the heart of one of Mexico's biggest dramas - and that's the issue of investigation," says newspaper columnist, Julian Andrade, who has also published a number of books on the drug war. "Remember that statistics show we have a 96-98% rate of impunity. The majority of crimes are never going to be investigated here in Mexico. This is the profound problem - that even high profile cases like this one which make an impact in the world's media still reflect the incapacity of the authorities to carry out investigations." The BBC was due to interview the National Security Commissioner in Mexico, Manuel Mondragon, to pose questions about security and the investigation into the beheading which appeared on Facebook. Despite repeated requests, the security commissioner's office has still not granted us an interview or made any comment on the video. It may be the case, of course, that the woman in the film was deeply entrenched in the drug war as an active member of the Gulf Cartel, as her killer intimated before the attack. But George Grayson says it is almost impossible to know for sure what her supposed crime against Los Zetas was. "Often these ghoulish events take the form of settling scores against someone who has offended Los Zetas or is in conflict with Los Zetas," he says. It's possible she was just a relative or friend of a member of a rival drug gang, and was killed for revenge. He recounts a story he has written about in the past in which a woman in Nuevo Laredo, said to be an informant, was allegedly beaten to death by the sadistic former leader of Los Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino or "Z-40", in front of an assembled group of corrupt policemen, sending out a clear message not to cross the cartel. "Twenty to 25 years ago, women were involved in the narco-trade but you typically didn't kill women. Now all the rules have changed and the Zetas have been the main impulse in changing the rules." Despite the reams of words written about the Facebook beheading video, seemingly no-one asked the basic question, "Who was this woman?" If her execution is now considered so normal in today's Mexico that it doesn't even merit an investigation, in the final analysis, it is perhaps this - rather than any decision by Facebook - that is the most "irresponsible" element of this brutal killing.

      <title>Weird short words in Scrabble finale</title>
      <description>The final game of the British National Scrabble Championships hinged on the word "coniines" - here are the most obscure words in the round.</description>

      <body>The final game of the British National Scrabble Championships hinged on the word "coniines". Few people will know what it means. Neither, perhaps did the two players. So here is a translation of the 12 most obscure words on that final board, writes Tom de Castella. Aecia: A fruiting body of a rust fungus Coniines: Alkaloid that makes up the poisonous part of hemlock Vela: Plural of velum, a glass screen Zeds: Name of the letter Z, plural Khis: Plural of khi, a letter in the Greek alphabet Fy: To digest Enew: (Hawk) Falconry term for driving a bird into the water Qat: variant spelling of khat, a plant whose leaves are chewed as a stimulant Litu: Plural of Litas, a former silver coin and monetary unit of Lithuania (Not in the OED online version) Atigi: Parka worn by the Inuits in northern Canada (Not in OED online) Bandura: Ukrainian lute Swarf: A swoon; grit abraded from an axle The margins can be fine. The official Scrabble dictionary is published by Collins. But not all the words played on that final board exist in the Oxford English Dictionary. "We don't yet have entries in the OED for atigi or bandura, but we've done some research on both, and they may well be added to the OED soon," says Dr Philip Durkin principal etymologist at the OED. Litas is missing, as is khi - the OED prefers the spelling chi for the Greek letter. Sam Richardson, publisher at Chambers, which used to produce the game's official dictionary, says there's always pressure to include new words purely for their usefulness in Scrabble. But the dictionaries always stand firm until a word has wider useage, he says. There is one major difference between a Scrabble dictionary and a conventional English dictionary. Once a word gets into the Scrabble Dictionary, it never drops out. "Scrabble players don't like to unlearn words," says Elaine Higgleton, publisher at Collins, which produces the current Scrabble Dictionary. The exception is for words mistakenly included. One such was "pH", Higgleton says. It used to be there because it didn't start with a capital and hence couldn't be classed as a proper noun. But in the 1990s it was taken out when someone realised it was an abbreviation, she says. Players often learn lists of words, paying no heed to meaning. Some of the world's best Scrabble players are Thai and can't speak English. An article in Slate even suggested that understanding English is a disadvantage at the very top level of the game. Purists may bridle at obscure words being thrown around by players who have no inkling what they mean. But there's nothing to stop part-time players using house rules, says Higgleton. Rule one might be, whosover places tiles on the sacred board, must be able to provide a ballpark definition of said word. It'll sort the banduras from the banditos.

      <title>'I wish IVF had never been invented'</title>
      <description>A recent Magazine article by Lisa Jardine about the many times that IVF fails prompted readers to send in with their own experiences.</description>

      <body>A recent Magazine article by Lisa Jardine about the frequency with which In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) fails prompted readers to send in their own experiences. Five million babies have been born worldwide since 1978 thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, said Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), in the article. Fertility problems are estimated to affect one in six or one in seven couples in the UK - approximately 3.5 million people . Around 60,000 fertility treatments are performed in UK licensed clinics per year, with the live birth rate after IVF about a quarter, according to latest figures (2010) from the HFEA. The latest HFEA figures show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients under the age of the 35 will be successful. And the percentages decrease as women get older. Moreover, costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics Here are some of our readers' experiences with IVF. Karen, Blackpool: I knew about my fertility issue as a teen and met my husband when I was 31 and living and working in France. We put our names down on the waiting list as soon as we could at a French hospital. As I had contributed to the French social security system, we did not have to pay for the treatment. However, we did have to wait four years and I was therefore 36 when I started treatment, by which time we had returned to the UK. Four donor embryos and nothing but empty arms. This treatment gave us nothing but false hope when we could have spent energy on other things at an earlier stage. Of course, you only get to hear the success stories. Thurstan, Farnborough: My wife and I are going through our second round of IVF after the first one didn't work. We got through to the very end successfully, but the final result did not happen. We have to pay for our treatment, yet if we lived five miles in a different direction we would have got it free. We are told the success rate - for us its 25% to 30% - and you do live on hope. It is absolutely crushing to find out it has not worked and nobody can tell you why. Another £6,000 down the drain and you are left with a devastated feeling. Joanna, UK: At 27 I was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, and then with signs of premature ovarian failure - with a three-year time limit for most women with my condition. The technology used in assisted reproductive techniques is ever changing. If we were to wait even just a year, our chances of success would potentially increase. But waiting wasn't an option for us. Without a crystal ball to see how technology will evolve, you're forced into an emotional "now or never" scenario. The first thing we did as a couple was to decide how many IVF attempts to make. We agreed three - the first ending in yet another miscarriage, the second ending in no viable embryos. The second round was by far the worst outcome. Sitting in the clinic car park having arrived a little early, we got a phone call telling us not to come in for what was our embryo transfer appointment, because there was nothing to transfer. No viable embryo. We didn't have the energy to go in for the testing results, we just went home. Even now, putting that into words is horribly difficult and not without pain. Awash with the IVF drugs, which are hormonally altering, you just can't trust yourself to be at your best to make major life decisions. A game plan becomes a must. Had we not decided upon a game plan, I think we would have become addicted to IVF and its offering of hope. Having a game plan was also necessary to make sure we were on the same page. It's a strain within a marriage, but we were fortunate. It's really a gamble. We've all heard the expression "that floored me'". The phone call that caused my knees to buckle, I crumpled in a heap of disbelief and tearful, shaking joy. That's the hope people are offered. J, Cumbria: I'm just about to start my second round of IVF, and as mad as it sounds I wish it wasn't available/invented. It gives you hope and you pray you are one of the lucky ones. It feels like a raffle - how many tickets do you buy? Gemma, Liverpool: At 29, having found out my fallopian tubes were blocked, I started IVF treatment only for it to result in a failure. We had been trying for nearly three years with one miscarriage, devastation and despair to show for it. It felt like we had to wait ages for the referral to the fertility centre, but in reality it was only about three months as I'd had a confirmed diagnosis. We were informed that despite the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stating that we should have three rounds of IVF, our primary care trust only funded two cycles. Straight away you feel under incredible pressure for it to work, as IVF can cost thousands of pounds at a private clinic - there is the worry of where you'd find the money (I work in the NHS, while my husband is a teacher). Arranging time off work, the endless appointments and the invasive treatment you go through in the hope that you'll get your dreamed for family out of it. It gave us hope that despite there being an issue with me, we might be able to have a family. Out of nine eggs, we only got four which fertilised normally, one was transferred and one was frozen. After the dread of a two-week wait, we found out that it was unsuccessful. I'd joined a support group and other women were announcing that their treatment was successful. It's horrible feeling guilty that you wish it was you experiencing joy rather than that woman, although you're so pleased they've been successful. We waited for months for a follow-up appointment, and it was decided that an operation was now my best option, with the possibility of removing my tubes - a scary prospect for any woman, but even worse when you know that's it - take them away and you've literally got no chance of falling pregnant naturally. Add in an extra wait for my operation, and by the time it came round I was a wreck. Amazingly, I didn't have to have my tubes removed. We were given the further hope that we might be able to conceive naturally, but if it didn't occur within a few months, there was still the frozen embryo. Imagine our surprise when four weeks after my operation my period was late. I'm now six months pregnant, and I still can't believe it, it still feels like a dream. Donna, UK: Several years ago, my husband and I embarked on consultations and investigations, then minor operations and IVF to be able to conceive. We had no choice but to go privately - at 34, I was the wrong age to get IVF on the NHS in our area. Having had the initial consultations and started a course of treatment we were told that IVF was not going to help us at all. In a way, we were lucky as our clinic was honest with us and did not try to "sell" us any more treatments or give us false hope - we had only spent £500. This enabled us to cope with the "loss" more easily at this early stage. Our expectations were well managed by our clinic, although I understand that this is not always the case. We have since gone on to adopt a beautiful boy who has made our family complete for the past three and a half years. I hated the invasive nature of IVF, and although I am glad we tried, I would never turn back the clock. We are financially secure now and would have had no savings for a rainy day if we had continued down the route of IVF. Beth, Sussex: Having been through IVF four times, I can honestly say that all these clinics are after is your money. I've never received a phone call or letter after a failed cycle. In fact, the last clinic in Brighton thought we had miscarried but my twins are now six months old. The clinic made no effort to contact us. It's shocking. Zoe, Bristol: I honestly believe that undergoing fertility treatment was the worst decision I have ever made. Before, I couldn't get pregnant because of a combined problem - I have polycystic ovaries and my husband has blocked tubes as a direct result of surgery as a baby - it was nobody's fault. I was 27 when we were referred, 28 when we first went to the clinic and 34 when we had treatment on the NHS. I was offered treatment again when I was 37, but couldn't go through with it. We needed a sperm donor just at the time the law changed on donor anonymity and the sperm banks ran dry - literally! I wrote letters and lobbied everyone we could think of to get treatment (at the time, there was no sperm for private patients either) and after two years our clinic managed to secure us sperm for three attempts. They all failed and in hindsight, I now know they had very little chance of success - funding meant we were offered a less superior form of treatment (and consequently a lower success rate - just 8%) and the clinic also made mistakes with our treatment regime. The pressure to go private was huge because the clinic couldn't offer the treatment we needed - they felt that the best option for us was private treatment and made this clear from the outset, but we couldn't afford it. At the age of 37, I discovered the clinic was able to offer ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) on the NHS, but I no longer met the criteria as my BMI was above 30. (If we had been private patients, BMI wouldn't have mattered). We were told from the outset about the failure rate and at every subsequent appointment. At times it felt that the clinic was only focused on the failure rate. The clinic counsellor only wanted to talk about failure which I felt was inappropriate in the middle of a cycle, whereas if I mentioned failure to the nursing staff, they always brushed it under the carpet, encouraging positive thinking instead. There was a lot of conflicting information - they would be happy to ram failure rates down your throat, but if you mentioned it, it was often glossed over. In the reception area there was a photo board of babies belonging to all the families who had had successful treatment - there was no mention of the other side. They didn't like it if I cried either - I was once told off for "snivelling" by one of the doctors. Undergoing treatment was difficult, but coming to terms with failure was much harder. Now the failure to get pregnant was purely my fault, something the clinic was very keen to reinforce - I was overweight, I had produced too many eggs, I hadn't taken my drugs correctly. Three times my body was fooled into thinking I was pregnant when no baby existed and I feel like I've had multiple miscarriages, except I haven't. I feel like I've lost a child, except I haven't. When people ask me about the worst part of infertility, I tell them it's the silence - they take that to mean that nobody talks about it and that is partly true, but for me, it's the silence which comes from the isolation and the lost friends who have moved on and had children. I no longer have anything in common with my peers. My mother-in-law recently told me that life goes on and it does go on around me, but life also stops with me - where there are no children, there are no grandchildren, no-one to care in later life, no legacy and that is silence which terrifies me. Fred, Whitby: There are unacceptable variations in the success rates of IVF. Living in one of the few areas of the country where IVF is not available on the NHS, we were forced to go private. Our options ranged from 17% at one local hospital, to 65% in a London clinic. We weighed up the options and, despite the significant extra cost and inconvenience, went for the London clinic. We knew we could only afford one cycle, but also that we didn't want to keep trying and failing. The difference was that it was in their interests to make sure everything was perfect before going ahead with the various procedures, as their success rates are their best advertisement. The local hospitals seem happy to press ahead, even when the body is not in its best condition to accept an embryo. Happily, we now have an amazing little boy. Karen, Cambridge: My husband and I went through five unsuccessful IVF treatments, and I have to say this was the worst period of my life. The drugs make you feel awful, it costs a fortune and the grief is overwhelming. All this happens in private, too, trying to carry on like nothing is happening. I went through an NHS hospital and two private hospitals and found very little compassion - we were just on a conveyor belt. We were told it was just "unexplained", but if we had been advised on more tests that were available earlier, we may have found a solution before it was too late. No doubt you will receive lots of nasty comments from people saying we should just adopt, or there are too many people in the world anyway - these usually come from people who haven't had to face that decision themselves and haven't really thought about what it means. Changes in the adoption process are, however, starting to make that a more viable option. Diane, York: I think it's quite naive to think that couples who embark on IVF don't know the odds of success. By the time they reach the decision of going down this route, they already know their chances are low. My husband and I certainly did. However, for us, it was a case of not looking back in 30 to 40 years' time, and saying that we wished we had at least tried. We were lucky, we are very proud parents of a lovely little boy at our third attempt, and we don't regret what we went through for one moment.

      <title>EU support wafer thin, says Cameron</title>
      <description>British people's support for staying in the European Union is "wafer thin" but can be increased if the relationship with Brussels changes, David Cameron says.</description>

      <body>British people's support for staying in the European Union is currently "wafer thin", David Cameron has said. The prime minister argued that his promise to renegotiate powers with Brussels before holding an "in-out" referendum had the "overwhelming support" of the public. He told business leaders the argument for remaining in the EU could be won if there was substantial reform. Labour is warning that the UK could "sleepwalk out of the EU". But Sir Michael Rake - president of the CBI business group - has warned both the Conservatives and Labour against political posturing on Europe and other issues, including energy prices, immigration, and the HS2 rail project. "It is very important that politicians, across the board, are careful about the words they use and the policies they espouse because this can lead to prejudicing investment and careless words can cost jobs," he told the BBC. Mr Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on whether the UK should quit the EU by the end of 2017 if the Conservative Party wins a majority at the next general election. This, he says, would follow a fundamental renegotiation of the relationship between London and Brussels. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, Mr Cameron said: "The current consent for remaining inside the European Union is wafer thin. We haven't made the argument enough about why it matters." He added: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It's a long-term strategy for Britain." Mr Cameron also said: "What I've put forward, I believe, has the overwhelming support of the British people and business people too." The CBI has published a report saying the EU is worth between 4% and 5% of UK annual output and is "overwhelmingly" best for business but that reforms are needed. The prime minister described the findings as "hugely helpful" to the European debate, adding: "The trouble is that the debate was just slipping away." He added: "We are doing what the British people and, I think, most business want. Let's get in there and negotiate a better deal for Britain. Then let's put the question." Mr Cameron said it was not for the UK to "stand in the way" of further political and financial integration by members of the eurozone, but it was "perfectly legitimate to say we outside the euro need some changes too". For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the conference that the UK was "better placed to shape Europe's future if we are fully engaged rather than having one foot out the door". He added: "We are clear that there is no future for Britain in walking away from our biggest market - or threatening to do so for reasons of internal party management. "Europe needs reform, but to walk away from our EU membership would be reckless, foolish and deeply damaging. On Britain's future in Europe, the national interest must come first." The CBI has said uncertainty about the outcome of a future referendum is already having a negative impact on inward investment. But the UK Independence Party said the CBI's view that leaving the EU "would somehow mean a sudden end to trading with Europe" was "deeply flawed". "The CBI does not consider the more realistic option that if we left the single market and freed ourselves from its red tape and politicised agenda we would still be able to continue to trade strongly with Europe on our own terms," said the party's leader Nigel Farage. "Leaving the EU would not mean turning our back on Europe." </body>

      <title>Probe of tagging contracts begins</title>
      <description>The Serious Fraud Office confirms that it has opened an investigation into the government's contracts with G4S and Serco over tagging criminals.</description>

      <body>The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) says it has opened an investigation into the government's contracts with G4S and Serco for tagging criminals. It comes after an audit suggested the firms had been charging for tagging criminals who were either dead, in jail or never tagged in the first place. In July, the government had asked the SFO to consider carrying out an investigation into G4S. G4S said it would co-operate fully with the SFO investigation. A spokesman for G4S said: "G4S confirms it has today received notice that the director of the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into the 'contract for the provision of electronic monitoring services, which commenced in April 2005, as amended and extended until the present day'. "G4S has confirmed to the SFO that it will co-operate fully with the investigation." The audit by accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, launched in May, alleged that the charging discrepancies began at least as far back as the start of the current contracts, in 2005, but could have dated back to the previous contracts in 1999. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the two firms that an independent "forensic audit" - a search for possible illegality - should be conducted, which among other things would need to examine email trails between bosses. G4S was reported to the SFO when it refused to co-operate with this further audit, while Serco allowed a further forensic audit to take place. In the course of the audit in September, the Ministry of Justice provided material to the SFO in relation to Serco's conduct. G4S made headlines after it failed to provide all of its contracted security guards for the London 2012 Olympics, prompting extra military personnel to be called in to fill the gap and leaving the firm with losses of £88m. </body>

      <title>Aircraft carrier costs 'to double'</title>
      <description>The cost of two new aircraft carriers being built for the Royal Navy is expected to be almost twice the original estimate, officials are expected to confirm.</description>

      <body>The cost of two new aircraft carriers being built for the Royal Navy is expected to be almost twice the original estimate, the government is expected to confirm this week. In the latest budget, the Ministry of Defence is set to estimate the cost of the two ships at £6.2bn. The department says it is renegotiating the contract to avoid further significant rises. Six years ago, when the contract was approved, costs were put at £3.65bn. The defence project is one of the biggest ever undertaken in the UK and has been beset by construction and design delays. A government source said it had inherited a flawed contract that was now being renegotiated to ensure industry shared the burden of any future rises. The shadow defence secretary, Labour's Vernon Coaker, said: "This is the latest in a series of financial fiascos in the MoD under David Cameron. "The defence secretary's claim that he has balanced the MoD books looks increasingly nonsensical. Britain deserves better than this shambolic approach to our nation's defence." During the course of the project, an order for carrier jump jets - capable of short take-offs and vertical landings - was switched to jets with a longer range that could carry more weapons. However, in February last year, the MoD decided to revert to the original jets for logistical and financial reasons. This "U-turn" saw £74m of taxpayers' money go "down the drain", Labour's Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said in September. The cross-party committee, which assesses value for money in government spending, has said it still regards the project as "a huge technical and commercial risk" and was not convinced the MoD had it under control. It said in its report that officials had made basic errors, such as failing to factor in the cost of inflation and VAT. Of the latest cost rises, the Ministry of Defence said: "Negotiations between the MoD and the Aircraft Carrier Alliance [the ship-builders] regarding the re-baselining of the Queen Elizabeth carrier programme are at an advanced stage. "No final decisions have been taken and the department will make an announcement in due course." Assembly work is taking place on both of the 65,000-tonne carriers at a specially extended dry dock at Rosyth, on the River Forth in Dunfermline. HMS Queen Elizabeth, which will not be finished until 2016 at the earliest, will be delivered before HMS Prince of Wales. The Royal Navy says the ships will carry helicopters until 2020, when the fighter jets will become available. The £6.2bn cost estimate for the project does not include buying the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The MoD says there are expected to be 48 jets, although this has not been confirmed. The UK currently has only one aircraft carrier - HMS Illustrious - but this cannot be used for strike aircraft, only helicopters. This has led to warnings of a decade-long capability gap. </body>

      <body>Britain's two new aircraft carriers are going to cost even more than originally thought, according to the Financial Times. The new price has gone up by an extra £800m, which takes the total cost to £6.2bn. Speaking to the Today Programme, Malcolm Chalmers, director of research at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), believes "when people look back they'll see this as an object lesson of how not to launch a major procurement project." He said: "We'll have to see the details before we get more of a sense of where responsibility lies. "But there are problems at the heart of the procurement system, that has got us into this situation in the first place."

      <title>Doctor Who 'better than real life'</title>
      <description>Tom Baker: 'Being the Doctor was so much better than real life'</description>

      <body>As Doctor Who nears its 50th anniversary, Tom Baker reflects on his seven years as the fourth Doctor. "It was so much better than real life," he says. Tom Baker is planning to break the habit of a lifetime on 23 November. The actor says he's never been interested in watching Doctor Who - including his own stories - but he plans to sit down in front of this month's special episode that will mark the show's 50th anniversary. "I hope it's going to be terrific," he says. "It's such a landmark. It'll be a big, emotional thing, but I don't know what they'll do - I'll make an exception and watch that." With his long scarf and love of jelly babies, Baker's fourth Doctor remains one of the most instantly recognisable incarnations of the Time Lord. He is also the show's longest-serving star, having played the role from 1974 to 1981. "I can't explain the show's longevity any more than I can explain my own," booms the 79-year-old actor when we meet in a private members' club in London's Covent Garden. "It's just a happy accident." Baker admits he "wasn't at all happy" just before he was cast to replace Jon Pertwee in what is arguably British TV's most well-known role. After joining Olivier's National Theatre company in the late 1960s, Baker moved into films. He was Rasputin in Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) and had roles in Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Canterbury Tales (1972) and The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973). But he was working as a labourer when he was cast in Doctor Who. "I was going through a bad time of feeling rejected, even though I'd had a flirtation with movies. I was on a building site, having no skill there except to make the tea and use a drill," Baker recalls. "So when the opportunity came to play Doctor Who, it was a jackpot." Baker's co-workers on the building site found out the news by reading it in the Evening Standard. "I went to work next morning - famous! They were so thrilled for me. I legged it down to Barclays Bank and got an advance and gave them a party. It was like being reborn." Baker admits he had no idea how he was going to tackle his role as the new star of Doctor Who. "How could I? I didn't watch it. I didn't watch it when I was in it and I haven't watched it since. So when it came, and these scripts were given to me, one of the problems was they were being written for Jon Pertwee - so I had to wrench it my way." Without doubt, Baker made the part his own. Viewing figures went up and many of his stories - The Ark in Space, Genesis of the Daleks, The Brain of Morbius, The Deadly Assassin and The Robots of Death - are regarded as classics. How did he find being the Doctor? Baker beams. "It was a great experience. Actors want a big audience, and to be admired and to get applause is one thing, but to be adored is something I recommend." He reminisces about visiting schools and hospitals, doing charity work and being flown round in helicopters. "Everywhere I went I was waving like royalty and dishing out 50 pence pieces," he says. "It was so much better than real life. I stayed so long because real life at the time wasn't so terrific. "Being Doctor Who, I used to look at the clock and know at half past four we were going to stop rehearsing - and that was a sad moment for me because I wanted to stay in this beautiful, unreal world." Asked if he has kept any Doctor Who props, Baker responds: "I had lots of bits and pieces but they've all been begged off me by the charities. It's all gone now." "I have some interesting letters from fans who saw me as a messianic figure and thought I could do miracles." He flashes one of his Doctor-like grins: "They were quite mistaken, but I didn't disabuse them." 'In the groove' After leaving Doctor Who in 1981, Baker's career embraced TV, stage and film. In 1982 he was Sherlock Holmes in BBC TV's The Hound of the Baskervilles, and his stage roles included Hedda Gabler, Educating Rita (RSC) and She Stoops to Conquer (NT). More recent TV roles include Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), Monarch of the Glen (2004-5) and the narrator of Little Britain. Despite his assertion that he's not watched his own stories, Baker has, of course, sat through some of them for DVD commentaries and at conventions. In recent years he has reprised the role of the Doctor for a number of Big Finish audio adventures. "I'm back now in the groove," Baker says. "The fans want to go back in time and I don't disappoint them because I haven't advanced at all from Doctor Who." All these years on, the actor notes, Doctor Who fans can still be in awe of him. "Anyone who's on television gets a reaction when playing a heroic part like the Doctor. And it still happens now with much older people. "But some of them are telling me lies," he adds, with a glint in his eye. "I met an old lady, aged about 85, the other day, who said: 'When I was a little girl I used to hide behind the sofa when I saw you!'" Many of those who watched the show in the 60s and 70s have helped bring on the next generation of fans. "People introduce me to their grandchildren or to their children," Baker says. "It's very sweet that it's passed on affectionately by parents, showing my old stuff. "Small children sometimes approach me and ask 'is it true you used to be Doctor Who?'" The Doctor Who 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor, will be shown on BBC One on 23 November. </body>

      <body>Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper Hugo Lloris was temporarily knocked out on Sunday before returning and completing the match. How dangerous is it to play on after being knocked out? The clash with the knee of Everton striker Romelu Lukaku was enough to force Lukaku off injured. But Lloris played on and went on to make a crucial save to keep the score at 0-0. The decision to allow him to continue has since been labelled "irresponsible" by brain injury charity Headway. FIFA's chief medical officer Jiri Dvorak said there's a "99% probability that losing consciousness in such an event will result in concussion". But Lloris had a CT scan after the match and showed no signs of concussion, according to the club. So did the medical team get lucky or could they make an accurate assessment on the ground? "Once the relevant tests and assessments were carried out we were totally satisfied that he was fit to continue playing," said Tottenham's head of medical services Wayne Diesel, on the club's website. When a player is knocked unconscious, medics refer to the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (Scat) or the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), says Gemma Davison, a former paramedic and a director of Firstaid4sport.co.uk. The latter gives an indication of how severe the head injury may be through a scoring system out of 15 - testing the individual's motor response, verbal response and eye opening. The whole process can take less than five minutes, she says. But there's a limit to what can be gauged from on-field inspections. "The risks are that even if no significant head injury is immediately apparent, there can be bleeding or swelling occurring in the brain that can result in damage if left untreated," says Davison. "Given that Lloris was knocked out, it clearly indicates a brain injury," says Prof Mike Barnes of the UK Acquired Brain Injury Forum. "By definition, if you're knocked out you've injured your brain." And it's impossible to decipher the internal damage from the side of a pitch, says Barnes, "even if 90% to 95% of the time it will be perfectly fine". "A sensible medic should have said, 'Sorry, you've got to come off,'" he says. It can take several hours for any signs of damage, so the safest thing to do would be to keep a player under observation, he says. Concussions have been in the news recently after Dr Barry O'Driscoll quit his International Rugby Board post claiming the body trivialised concussion. "A concussion is concussion, whether it's in rugby, football or walking down the street. The risks are the same," says Luke Griggs of Headway. "People often think that for any significant damage to be done it must be a really severe blow to the head - that's not the case." Many observers expressed admiration for Lloris' desire to return to the field, something manager Andre Villas-Boas acknowledged helped to convince him that he was OK to continue. "It cannot be right that a player makes a decision whether he's fit to play, not in this day and age," says Griggs. "We're more evolved than that and it should be taken out of the hands of the player - and the manager." "We're not talking about a potential concussion here - we're talking about the fact that he was actually unconscious." "It was an unnecessary risk," agrees Barnes. "If you're knocked out you ought to come off. There are no signs on the pitch that you can tell whether he's going to be fine or not." Follow @BBCNewsMagazine on Twitter and on Facebook </body>

      <description>New documentary tells hidden story of Northern Ireland's Troubles</description>

      <body>"Can you imagine being a little boy and watching men and women come and take your mother?" These words open a chilling new documentary telling the hidden story of the Disappeared; at least 15 people who were murdered and buried in secret graves by the IRA during Northern Ireland's Troubles. Some of their bodies have never been found. Presenter Darragh McIntyre hears the previously untold stories of many of the relatives left to grieve for decades while never quite knowing the fate of their loved ones. The voice of Seamus Heaney reading his poem, the Bog Queen, can be heard at the start and end of the programme over stark footage of the vast marshlands in various parts of the Republic of Ireland where the bodies are believed to lie within. One family that did finally receive closure was that of Jean McConville, a widow and mother-of-10 who was dragged from her home in west Belfast. Her body was recovered in 2003 on a beach in County Louth in the Republic of Ireland. Her daughter Agnes gives her first broadcast interview since her mother's remains were discovered. In one poignant moment, her interview is intercut with footage of her as a child just weeks after her mother's disappearance where she says: "We'll keep our fingers crossed and pray for her to come back." While the dramatic story initially attracted the attention of the media in the weeks around Christmas 1972, republicans sent out the message that she was merely "in hiding" because of the publicity; headlines like "Missing mother reported to be back in Belfast" began emerging. Agnes McConville said she and her siblings were hearing a different story "Children growing up around Divis flats would hear what their parents were saying. Your mummy's a tout, she's this and that, your mummy will never be back, she's gone with a British soldier - this wasn't coming from the adults, it was coming from the children," she said. Within months the children were split up in various care homes across Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams is repeatedly pressed in the documentary about allegations he was involved in the disappearance of Mrs McConville - allegations he repeatedly rejects. Documentary maker Alison Millar said when she saw the moving footage from 1972 of the McConville children talking about their mother, she had been determined to track down Agnes. "She had never seen the famous clip, and she just kept saying 'they could have killed me, I said all that as a child, where did I get the strength from?'" She said the access they got to the families involved a period of building up a rapport. "We started meeting families 18 months ago and we didn't start filming until early this year," she said. "A lot of my work is from that tradition of film-making where most of your time is tea and biscuits, and the last bit is where you work it all out. "The relationships were built up by both myself and Darragh by just talking to people." This intimacy has led to moving encounters with several relatives of the Disappeared who have previously not been in the spotlight. The programme also hears the story of the priest who gave the last rites to Eamon Molloy before he was executed. His body was found at an old cemetery between the border and Dundalk, County Louth, in 1999. Phil Smyth shows a photograph she took of her 17-year-old nephew Kevin McKee on the day he went missing. The youngest of all the Disappeared, his body has never been found. Alison Millar said it was "tough viewing" for the families who were given a preview of the documentary. "It's very raw still and while maybe they were fine watching their own story, when they saw something like Kathleen Armstrong talking to her husband Charlie at his grave, they were deeply moved," she said. Darragh McIntyre said the use of Seamus Heaney's poetry was "unconventional but adds a lot to the film". "I sent him a fax to get permission as that was the way you'd communicate with him - I explained the exact context of how we wanted to use it. "We got a note back saying he was delighted and that he felt the poem was suitable to be used in this way." He says that while the film examines a dark chapter in Northern Ireland's past, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains - which co-ordinates searches and obtains information in confidentiality - is hopeful that it may result in fresh leads. "This is a current story - seven people are still missing, and four of them are probably within 40 minutes of Dublin city centre, in bogs in County Meath," he said. The Disappeared is shown at 22:35 GMT on Monday 4 November on BBC One Northern Ireland, and at 22:00 GMT on Tuesday 5 November on BBC Four. A series of additional clips are available on the programme's website. </body>

      <title>Coastal retreat plan to curb floods</title>
      <description>The stretch of coast being returned to the sea</description>

      <body>A scheme to combat flooding by surrendering land to the sea will be completed on Monday on the south coast. The £28m "managed realignment" at Medmerry in West Sussex has seen the building of 7km (four miles) of new sea walls up to 2km inland. By letting the waters in, the Environment Agency says the risk of flooding for hundreds of homes will be reduced. The surrendered land will become a wetland habitat for many species. The sea has long been a threatening presence on the flat land of the Manhood Peninsula that juts into the English channel on the coast between Portsmouth and Worthing. Caravan parks in Selsey and Bracklesham Bay have been flooded a number of times in recent years, as the shingle defences have yielded to the surging seas. Since 2011, the Environment Agency have been working on a plan that they believe curbs that threat. The project is billed as the country's largest ever coastal flood realignment scheme, but it has required the destruction of the existing sea wall at Medmerry and giving back to the sea some of the land nearest to the coast. "We have made a hole in the sea wall," the Environment Agency's flood and coastal risk manager, Andrew Gilham, told BBC News on a visit to the site. "But before doing that we've actually built 7km of new defences further inland from the coast. What we've been able to create here is an area that can absorb the energy of the waves and reduce the flood risk to people." Although the new walls are much closer to local communities, the Agency says homes are much better protected as a result, with the development able to withstand a once in a thousand year flood. The change is partly being forced on the Agency because of EU legislation that requires compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat through development. The Medmerry scheme makes up for the loss of similar conservation areas in and around the Solent. "It is not politically driven," said Mr Gilham. "But the benefit of creating the habitat here is not only to reduce flood risk in this area but also to reduce flood risk to communities in Portsmouth and Southampton. "If we weren't able create habitat here we wouldn't be be able to do those defences." The scale of the £28m development is enormous. Between the new earthen walls and the sea stand 183 hectares of land that the Agency says will rapidly become a saltwater marsh, with potentially huge benefits for wildlife in the area. It will be managed by the RSPB. "Even in construction, we're seeing lots of migratory birds using this area," said Andrew Gilham. "It is already starting to be used by the wildlife. It's a massive nature reserve and a massive opportunity on the south coast." Local people are hoping that letting the sea in will not only protect their homes but boost the local economy as well. Alan Chamberlain is the estate manager of the newly renamed Medmerry Park holiday village. His business, located next door to the new habitat, is actually below sea level. "In the past we have been very close to flooding, and now we've got a one-in-one-thousand-year protection, one of the best in the country actually," he told BBC News. "For us it's a win win, it will encourage visitors to the site, birdwatchers and those interested in nature." The new development is facing its first big test on the day it opens as it will see one of the highest tides of the year. But the Environment Agency are fully confident it will pass with flying colours. Medmerry is one of a number of managed realignment projects that the Environment Agency are involved in. Andrew Gilham says it's part of a new approach. "Rather than fighting it, we are working with nature," he explained. "It's an important change in approach, you can only keep building bigger and bigger defences for so long. We have to ask if we can make better use of public money. "Certainly the habitat we are creating here is important to the broader ecosystem and the broader economy of the country by encouraging people to visit remote areas." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>'Quiet man' who kept England green</title>
      <description>The "unprepossessing" lawyer who kept England green</description>

      <body>Sir Robert Hunter was an "unprepossessing" lawyer who shunned the limelight but used his legal knowledge to acquire swathes of countryside for public use as a co-founder of the National Trust. On the centenary of his death, who was the man behind the idea credited with keeping England green? His unmarked grave's location is shrouded in mystery and there are no markers to show his place of birth. But Sir Robert's careful work led to the founding of the National Trust and gave it the powers it enjoys today - and the quiet and introverted civil servant will take centre stage on the 100th anniversary of his death. Haslemere, where Sir Robert lived in Surrey, will see a performance at the museum on the centenary, 6 November, and a talk by the National Trust's director general Dame Helen Ghosh the next day. The National Trust said Sir Robert's big idea was to use the law as "a battering ram" against landowners to acquire large areas of countryside for the public. It was a strategy the charity described as a simple concept with huge potential. And it is thanks to him, the charity said, that London is now one of Europe's greenest cities. But why is Sir Robert not as well known as the trust he helped create? John Owen Smith, the local historian and playwright who will impersonate Sir Robert, said he was a difficult man to get into. "He was very quiet, very unprepossessing. He didn't have that much personality and he wasn't much good at public speaking," he said. "He preferred quiet persuasion, and would rather be pulling levers." Katherine Jessel, from the Friends of the Parish of Haslemere, and also a local historian, believes his request to be buried in an unmarked grave shows he was "probably genuinely humble." She said: "I think he had a dry sense of humour. He was an introverted workaholic with a twinkle in his eye." But she believes he had tremendous foresight: "He saw the way it was going, with roads, buildings and cars." Ben Cowell, the National Trust's East of England's regional director, said out of the charity's three founders, Sir Robert was less of a public figure. He said there were various theories about his request for an unmarked grave. "No-one knows where it is," he said. "It might just be bad record-keeping though he may have been buried at home. "It's not necessarily that he is an obscure figure. He was not somebody who would have wanted public attention and a grand memorial in his name, or a statue." The National Trust was more concerned about the lack of a blue plaque at the place of Sir Robert's birth in Camberwell, south London, he added. "People have applied twice to English Heritage and it has been rejected both times," he said. English Heritage said the blue plaques scheme which commemorates notable figures and buildings was hugely popular and over-subscribed and difficult decisions had to be made. "An important factor in the decision not to shortlist Sir Robert was that it was felt commemoration at his Surrey residence, where he lived for over 30 years, would be more appropriate than a blue plaque in London," it said. "Sir Robert will, however, be eligible for re-proposing for a plaque in 2015." Haslemere's church has a memorial for Sir Robert, as the first parish council chairman, and a memorial also stands at Waggoners Wells. Mr Cowell said: "He was really important to us. He came up with the idea, came up with the name and wrote our founding documents." Hampstead Heath, Wimbledon Common and Epping Forest were all threatened with development and protected, he added. "The reason London is one of the greenest and woodiest of European cities is because of that movement - using the law to further the aim of saving open spaces," he said. In the charity's early years, its three founders were busy using legal powers to buy land, he said. It led to concentrations of National Trust sites where they lived, with Sir Robert in Surrey, Octavia Hill in Kent and Hardwicke Rawnsley in the Lake District. "In Haslemere, he is venerated - almost like a saint," he added. Sir Robert was behind the trust's acquisition of Hindhead Commons and the Devil's Punch Bowl in 1906. He went on to draft the National Trust Act, which said the charity must hold assets in perpetuity. But what would Sir Robert think of the National Trust as it is now? This year, the charity has been criticised by its tenants and has courted controversy over its decision to open the Big Brother house. In the past, it has also been censured for "Disney-fying" properties. Haslemere's historians said if Sir Robert could see the National Trust today, he might think it had grown "too powerful". Ms Jessel said: "He would be a little bit worried at how big it has grown and whether it can grow any bigger." But Mr Cowell said: "He formed our constitution and charitable purposes very carefully. "It gives us all sorts of powers to intervene in things. He was very conscious about what he was doing." </body>

      <body>Monday's papers express differing views over Labour leader Ed Miliband's proposal to give tax rebates to companies who pay their workers more. "Another weekend," says the Daily Telegraph, "another Labour gimmick." The Independent says the Labour leader won "rare praise from employers" for his suggestion. And the Sun also commends him for focusing on what it calls "the most important issue for most people" - the cost of living. But there the back-patting ends. The Sun agrees firms should pay more, if they can afford it - "but if they can't, a minimum wage job is better than no job at all". The Telegraph says growth is the way to ensure that people in work are paid more. The paper concludes that Labour has abandoned the task of developing a defensible economic policy and has chosen instead to put forward "temporary relief backed by fatuous slogans". Others turn their attention to what the Daily Mail calls "Labour's squalid saga of fraud and coercion" - the continuing controversy surrounding the party's candidate selection process in Falkirk. According to the Mail, a woman who gave evidence that she had been made a party member without her consent insists that she stands by what she said - her union, Unite, had said she had withdrawn her claim. The Mail thinks "the whiff of sleaze has become an overpowering stench". The Times reports that Mr Miliband has come under attack from Labour members in Falkirk for failing to publish a critical report on what happened. The dispute about the benefits of remaining a member of the European Union rumbles on. The Daily Express endorses a call from Conservative MP James Wharton for a referendum before the end of 2017. He tells the paper's readers that Britain is facing "a historic choice" - and it is time to let the people decide. In the Guardian, Business Secretary Vince Cable puts the contrary point of view. He dismisses those he calls "fantasists on the right who dream of a lost world of global empire". Rather, he argues, we gain more from membership than it costs, and "millions of jobs and livelihoods" depend on staying in. The Financial Times paints a more complicated picture. It says business is divided about several strands of the European argument and even if it could speak with one voice on the subject, the paper wonders whether the public would listen. Governments are told there is no more fundamental task than defending the country from its enemies. An interview with the new chief of the defence staff in the Times explores who those enemies might be and how the job might be done. General Sir Nicholas Houghton, who is described as "a straight-talking Yorkshireman", looks at the changes that will need to be made once the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been completed next year. He says soldiers do not want to be waiting around, playing sport and doing adventure training. Instead, he envisages more involvement in training local forces in west and east Africa to counter the threat of Islamist terrorism. The Times says he sees the military as "the go-to people whenever there is a national crisis". The Sun has a story to terrify arachnophobes. The paper tells how a family from south-east London carried lethal Brazilian wandering spiders home with them among fruit they had bought from Sainsbury's. No-one was bitten but the house had to be fumigated. The Sun has the headline: "Banana critters." </body>

      <title>May defends terror control system</title>
      <description>Home Secretary Theresa May insists the system for dealing with terror suspects is "strong and sustainable" despite a suspect escaping surveillance disguised in a burka.</description>

      <body>The home secretary has insisted the system for dealing with terror suspects is "strong and sustainable". It comes after a suspect, who was subject to an order restricting his movements, absconded from a London mosque disguised as a woman in a burka. Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed, 27, is the second suspect under a so-called TPim order to go missing in under a year. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said changes to controls on suspects had made it easier for them to vanish. Somali-born Mr Mohamed entered the mosque in Acton, west London, in western-style clothes, but was seen on CCTV leaving with his face and body fully covered by a burka. It follows the disappearance of Ibrahim Magag in December, who absconded in a black cab after ripping off his electronic tag. Mr Mohamed, who has been linked to the Somali militant group al-Shabab, was subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measures (TPim) notice, which is aimed at protecting the public from people the home secretary believes to have engaged in terrorism-related activity but who it is not deemed feasible to prosecute or deport. Theresa May told MPs: "Even if we wanted to go back to the days of control orders, we would not be able to do so. "The powers available under control orders were being steadily eroded by the courts and the system was becoming unviable. Unlike control orders, TPims have been upheld consistently by the courts so we now have a strong and sustainable legal framework to handle terror suspects. "The police and the security services have always said that there has been no substantial risk since the introduction of TPims." Ms Cooper said the home secretary had made it easier for serious terror suspects to disappear, which was "irresponsible". "She was warned about changing the law, she was warned about weakening controls, she was warned more people would abscond and they have - twice -but still she won't act. The question on everyone's lips is how many more warnings does this home secretary need?," she said. Mrs May said Mr Mohamed's tag was thought to have be working correctly: "I have been advised that this abscond has not raised any new operational issues with the tags." Prime Minister David Cameron said TPims "do work" but when there was a problem the government needed to "act very, very quickly and get on top of it and we will". BBC political correspondent Norman Smith said what was extraordinary was that Theresa May had been entirely un-contrite about what had happened, insisting there was not going to be a return to control orders. He added that what was even more striking was the lack of a backlash from her own backbenchers. Mr Mohamed, 27, arrived at the An-Noor Masjid and Community Centre, in Church Road, Acton, at approximately 10:00 GMT on Friday, and was seen inside at 15:15 GMT. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "The Counter Terrorism Command immediately launched inquiries to trace Mr Mohamed and these continue. "Ports and borders were notified with his photograph and details circulated nationally. Public safety remains our priority." Lib Dem peer Lord Carlile, the former reviewer of anti-terror laws, said: "We were assured by the government that extra money would be spent on surveillance to ensure that exactly this kind of event did not occur. "Yet the person concerned was able to walk in the front door of a mosque as a man and out through another door as a woman, on CCTV which was not seen, apparently, by the authorities." The court-approved TPim orders include a requirement that their subjects report daily to the authorities, stay overnight at a specified address, wear a GPS tag, and face restrictions on travel, movement, association and communication. They were introduced in January 2012 to replace control orders, which had been in place for seven years and also included the power to relocate suspects. When the TPims order was obtained, Mr Mohamed was said to have received terrorist training in Somalia and fought on the front line in support of al-Shabab. Court documents also say he supported a UK-based network supporting terrorist-related activity in Somalia and had been involved in attack planning against Western interests in east Africa. A spokesman for the mosque in Acton said: "The recent incident bears no semblance to the work we do as an organisation for the development of the community at large." </body>

      <title>'No plans' to reopen Falkirk inquiry</title>
      <description>The Labour Party has said it has no plans to reopen its investigation over vote-rigging claims in Falkirk.</description>

      <body>The Labour Party has said it has no plans to reopen its investigation over vote-rigging claims in Falkirk. It came after a former Labour chancellor added his voice to calls for a new inquiry to be carried out into the allegations. Alistair Darling said it was clear the original Labour Party inquiry "didn't have all the facts". But a spokesman for the party said it had "not seen any new evidence to justify further action". In September, Labour said it had cleared the Unite union of trying to rig the selection process for a parliamentary candidate in Falkirk. It said the decision was made after "key evidence" was "withdrawn". A Labour Party spokesman on Monday said it had re-interviewed an important witness, Lorraine Kane, following newspaper allegations. Mrs Kane had told them nothing to justify reopening the inquiry, he said. Mrs Kane and husband Michael were alleged to have had their memberships of the Labour Party paid for by Unite on the basis that they would support the union's preferred candidate for the seat. Mr Kane told the BBC on Monday: "I gave statements a while ago and that's it finished with." Asked if he changed his initial statement to the party, Mr Kane said "No. I never changed nothing." However, it was not clear whether the statement he was referring to was one in which the original allegations were made, or a subsequent statement which withdrew some of the evidence. The Labour spokesman added: "Throughout this process we have acted to uphold the integrity of the Labour Party. Throughout this we have said we will look at any new evidence which might justify the reopening of our inquiry. "That is why the General Secretary of the Labour Party approached Mrs Lorraine Kane today after reports in the Daily Mail. She said today she stands by a sworn affidavit given to us on 2nd September. "It was that affidavit which was part of the reason that led the Labour Party to conclude there was insufficient evidence to proceed with our inquiry. Therefore we have not seen any new evidence to justify further action. "There is now a police inquiry going on into other issues around Falkirk and we will of course consider the outcome of that inquiry." Speaking earlier on Monday, Mr Darling told BBC Scotland he believed something had "gone very wrong in Falkirk" and there "needed to be a thorough investigation". He said: "I understand the police are looking at it now. If the police decide to proceed they will send a report to the procurator fiscal and then it goes through the criminal justice system. "If the police for whatever reason decide they are not doing it then there needs to be a proper inquiry, one that people have confidence in, people can see what happened. "Its results need to be published so that people can see exactly what happened and to make sure this sort of thing doesn't happen again. It has got no place in politics. "I think the problem with the last report was quite clearly it didn't have all the facts that are now available." Several Labour councillors in Falkirk have told the BBC that Ed Miliband must now publish the party's report on the affair or re-investigate what happened. The leader of the Scottish Labour Party had earlier said the inquiry may have to be reopened. Johann Lamont told the BBC "we certainly have to look at that" because of concerns the investigation "wasn't entirely complete". But Ms Lamont said there were no plans to make the original inquiry's report public. At the weekend it was revealed that Stephen Deans, the chairman of Falkirk Labour Party, intended to stand down from his post. Mr Deans, who had been a full time Unite official at the Grangemouth oil refinery and petrochemical plant, had been accused of being involved in vote-rigging in Falkirk, but was later cleared by Labour's internal investigation. Ms Lamont was asked by presenter Gary Robertson whether she had spoken to Mr Deans. She responded: "I didn't believe it appropriate for me to speak to Stevie Deans. "What I am very clear - this is about a situation that is entirely unacceptable for the Labour Party that we have presumed through the selection process that if you can get selected, we presumed that voters will come with us afterwards - that is entirely the wrong message." The Sunday Times said it had seen 1,000 emails to and from Mr Deans, which it said revealed the full extent of the plot to influence the selection process. Its story also included extracts of the internal Labour report in which Labour officials said there were "deliberate attempts to frustrate" interviews with some of the key witnesses. The emails suggested that a letter retracting key evidence in the Labour investigation was not written by the witnesses but by union officials and approved by Mr Deans, according to the Sunday Times. Police in Scotland, who earlier this year dropped an investigation into the Falkirk allegations, are studying the leaked emails. </body>

      <title>EU support wafer thin, says Cameron</title>
      <description>British people's support for staying in the European Union is "wafer thin" but can be increased if the relationship with Brussels changes, David Cameron says.</description>

      <body>British people's support for staying in the European Union is currently "wafer thin", David Cameron has said. The prime minister argued that his promise to renegotiate powers with Brussels before holding an "in-out" referendum had the "overwhelming support" of the public. He told business leaders the argument for remaining in the EU could be won if there was substantial reform. Labour is warning that the UK could "sleepwalk out of the EU". But Sir Michael Rake - president of the CBI business group - has warned both the Conservatives and Labour against political posturing on Europe and other issues, including energy prices, immigration, and the HS2 rail project. "It is very important that politicians, across the board, are careful about the words they use and the policies they espouse because this can lead to prejudicing investment and careless words can cost jobs," he told the BBC. Mr Cameron has promised to hold a referendum on whether the UK should quit the EU by the end of 2017 if the Conservative Party wins a majority at the next general election. This, he says, would follow a fundamental renegotiation of the relationship between London and Brussels. Speaking at the CBI's annual conference, Mr Cameron said: "The current consent for remaining inside the European Union is wafer thin. We haven't made the argument enough about why it matters." He added: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It's a long-term strategy for Britain." Mr Cameron also said: "What I've put forward, I believe, has the overwhelming support of the British people and business people too." The CBI has published a report saying the EU is worth between 4% and 5% of UK annual output and is "overwhelmingly" best for business but that reforms are needed. The prime minister described the findings as "hugely helpful" to the European debate, adding: "The trouble is that the debate was just slipping away." He added: "We are doing what the British people and, I think, most business want. Let's get in there and negotiate a better deal for Britain. Then let's put the question." Mr Cameron said it was not for the UK to "stand in the way" of further political and financial integration by members of the eurozone, but it was "perfectly legitimate to say we outside the euro need some changes too". For Labour, shadow chancellor Ed Balls told the conference that the UK was "better placed to shape Europe's future if we are fully engaged rather than having one foot out the door". He added: "We are clear that there is no future for Britain in walking away from our biggest market - or threatening to do so for reasons of internal party management. "Europe needs reform, but to walk away from our EU membership would be reckless, foolish and deeply damaging. On Britain's future in Europe, the national interest must come first." The CBI has said uncertainty about the outcome of a future referendum is already having a negative impact on inward investment. But the UK Independence Party said the CBI's view that leaving the EU "would somehow mean a sudden end to trading with Europe" was "deeply flawed". "The CBI does not consider the more realistic option that if we left the single market and freed ourselves from its red tape and politicised agenda we would still be able to continue to trade strongly with Europe on our own terms," said the party's leader Nigel Farage. "Leaving the EU would not mean turning our back on Europe." </body>

      <body>The Royal Family and TV show Downton Abbey could boost the UK's global business links, peers have heard. Popular cultural exports should be used to help "establish a dialogue and trust" with other countries, former engineering boss David Stanley told a House of Lords Committee. After this, more firms could "hopefully do business", he added. Peers also heard the government should do more to ensure overseas trade missions create permanent trade. The Lords Committee on Soft Power and the UK's Influence, which is looking at ways to improve the country's image and attractiveness abroad, heard several suggestions for promoting it as a "brand". Mr Stanley, former chief executive of the The Penspen Group, which operates engineering and management services, said it was important in business to "create a link". He added: "If it's Downton Abbey or the Olympics or the opening of Parliament, they are all areas where you can establish a dialogue and trust." The ITV show Downton Abbey, chronicling the lives of an early 20th Century aristocratic family and its staff, has been an enormous hit in the US and elsewhere. The committee heard that the UK had to present a modern, open, hi-tech image to attract business in a competitive global market. But John Barry, the Shell corporation's chairman in Abu Dhabi, argued that the country's traditional image was also marketable. He said: "We must not throw out the baby with the bathwater. There's a significant number of countries where [the Royal Family] are incredibly important in creating contacts at the top level." The committee's chairman, Conservative Lord Howell of Guildford, said: "So we now have a paradox where royalty is leading us into a new era of soft power." During the hearing, Mr Barry praised the coalition's efforts to run overseas trade missions, where the prime minister is accompanied by leading business people. However, he warned these should not be one-offs and that permanent relationships must be built, with UK representatives returning countries. Lord Howell said: "You can't just tick a box and say: 'We've done Indonesia.' You have got to keep going." </body>

      <title>Coulson 'never involved in hacking'</title>
      <description>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones", his barrister tells an Old Bailey jury.</description>

      <body>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones - whatever others might have been doing on his watch", an Old Bailey jury has heard. His barrister Timothy Langdale QC was speaking after the conclusion of the prosecution opening statement. He said Mr Coulson wished he had made some "different decisions" but "he did not commit these offences". Mr Coulson, 45, of Charing, Kent, denies conspiracy to hack phones. Mr Coulson, who also denies conspiracy to commit misconduct, left the newspaper industry in 2007 and went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director. He is among eight defendants, who all deny the range of charges against them. Making opening remarks, which he said was a "relatively uncommon" for a defence barrister, Mr Langdale said his client would be taking to the witness box later in the trial to give evidence about "the fast-moving world of Sunday tabloid journalism - a fiercely competitive world". He said Mr Coulson's job was "not to know about every story during the week", adding there were "many thousands of pieces of information, many of which never got in the paper at all". Reporters kept sources close to their chest, often protecting them from rivals on their own newspaper, Mr Langdale added. And he told the court that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who has a conviction for phone hacking for the News of the World and has admitted other phone-hacking charges, had targeted the phone of Mr Coulson. Mr Langdale said the case had "an unusual history" and "the trial itself will be unusually long". He also warned about "unfair reporting" of events, saying the Guardian newspaper had been wrong to say in July 2011 that News of the World journalists had deleted messages on the phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who went missing in 2002. There was no evidence to suggest Mr Mulcaire or any other person acting for the paper had deleted any message "deliberately or accidentally", he said. There was nothing the paper had done which gave rise to any "false hope" that Milly Dowler was still alive, he added. Later the court heard from the first witness, Det Sgt Gregory Smith, who investigated the phone hacking allegations. Jurors heard about a message from a recruitment firm left on the teenager's phone, a detail which became the subject of a News of the World story about her. Of the prosecution handling of the evidence, Mr Langdale said: "Their interpretation is wrong, their conclusions are wrong - there will be a time to reflect all that." Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC earlier told the court that notebooks went missing amid the "media firestorm" caused by the revelation that News of the World journalists had hacked Milly Dowler's phone. Those claims led to the closure of the paper in July 2011. Mr Edis said News International executive Rebekah Brooks and others hid evidence as police investigated the newspaper. He said security staff picked up a laptop and other material from Mrs Brooks's home in Oxfordshire, which was later found hidden in a bin bag near bins at her Chelsea Harbour flat. The court heard that, after it was hidden, a member of the security team sent a text to former security chief Mark Hanna that said: "Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Pizza delivered and the chicken is in the pot." Mrs Brooks, who was editor of the News of the World between 2000 and 2003, and her PA Cheryl Carter deny perverting the course of justice. Mrs Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, denies a second similar charge, along with her husband Charlie Brooks and Mr Hanna. She also denies conspiracy to intercept communications and conspiracy to commit misconduct. The trial continues. </body>

      <title>Probe of tagging contracts begins</title>
      <description>The Serious Fraud Office confirms that it has opened an investigation into the government's contracts with G4S and Serco over tagging criminals.</description>

      <body>The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) says it has opened an investigation into the government's contracts with G4S and Serco for tagging criminals. It comes after an audit suggested the firms had been charging for tagging criminals who were either dead, in jail or never tagged in the first place. In July, the government had asked the SFO to consider carrying out an investigation into G4S. G4S said it would co-operate fully with the SFO investigation. A spokesman for G4S said: "G4S confirms it has today received notice that the director of the Serious Fraud Office has opened an investigation into the 'contract for the provision of electronic monitoring services, which commenced in April 2005, as amended and extended until the present day'. "G4S has confirmed to the SFO that it will co-operate fully with the investigation." The audit by accountancy firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, launched in May, alleged that the charging discrepancies began at least as far back as the start of the current contracts, in 2005, but could have dated back to the previous contracts in 1999. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling told the two firms that an independent "forensic audit" - a search for possible illegality - should be conducted, which among other things would need to examine email trails between bosses. G4S was reported to the SFO when it refused to co-operate with this further audit, while Serco allowed a further forensic audit to take place. In the course of the audit in September, the Ministry of Justice provided material to the SFO in relation to Serco's conduct. G4S made headlines after it failed to provide all of its contracted security guards for the London 2012 Olympics, prompting extra military personnel to be called in to fill the gap and leaving the firm with losses of £88m. </body>

      <title>HS2 opponents risk UK's future - PM</title>
      <description>Opponents of the HS2 rail link are "putting our country's future at risk", Prime Minister David Cameron tells the CBI annual conference.</description>

      <body>Opponents of the HS2 rail link are "putting our country's future at risk", Prime Minister David Cameron has said. He spoke at the CBI annual conference after speculation that Labour would withdraw its support for the high-speed rail network from London to Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Shadow chancellor Ed Balls will say Labour's support is "not at any cost". Mr Cameron also said the new boss of HS2 would find ways to cut the estimated £50bn cost of the scheme. He said Sir David Higgins would "make absolutely sure we drive every extra bit of cost out of this that we can, so it comes in under the budget that's been set". "I want to make sure we get every penny of value for money from this HS2 investment," he said. "I think it is fantastic that Sir David Higgins - the man who built the Olympics on time and on budget - is going to be running HS2." He added: "People who are against it, in my view, are putting our country's future at risk, they are putting the future of the North of England at risk," he said. "We need to have a concerted consensus across business, across politics, that we get behind these large infrastructure projects." He said making the investment would "make sure our economy shares growth between the north and south - it will link eight of our 10 biggest cities". Sir David has said he believes the scheme can come in "substantially" under the current budget if the £14bn set aside for contingency costs is reduced. Mr Balls, meanwhile, told the conference: "The Labour Party cannot - and will not - give the government a blank cheque." "That is what you would expect from any credible official opposition seeing a government desperately mismanaging a project. And that is what is happening here with the costs having shot up to £50bn. "We will put the national interest and the taxpayer interest first. "We will take a hard-headed look at the costs and benefits of the scheme to ensure this is the best way to spend £50bn for the future of our country." He said a Labour government would set up an independent infrastructure commission to end delays in major infrastructure projects. In his speech, CBI president Sir Mike Rake criticised "commercially harmful" indecision over HS2. "We cannot have every major infrastructure decision continuously redebated at every turn, as we're seeing with HS2," he told the conference. "Undoubtedly, a better effort should be made to communicate the benefits of high speed rail, and this must be positioned within an overall, long-term strategy of what the country needs across all modes of transport. "Decisions have to be made, and once they have been made then we should stick to them." MPs last week approved funding to prepare for the high-speed rail network. The HS2 project would see lines built between Birmingham and London, followed by a V-shaped second phase building separate tracks from Birmingham to Manchester and Leeds. The government hopes to begin construction on the first phase of HS2 in 2017 and open that part of the line in 2026. The additional lines to Leeds and Manchester could then be completed by 2032-33. </body>

      <title>Aircraft carrier costs 'to double'</title>
      <description>The cost of two new aircraft carriers being built for the Royal Navy is expected to be almost twice the original estimate, officials are expected to confirm.</description>

      <body>The cost of two new aircraft carriers being built for the Royal Navy is expected to be almost twice the original estimate, the government is expected to confirm this week. In the latest budget, the Ministry of Defence is set to estimate the cost of the two ships at £6.2bn. The department says it is renegotiating the contract to avoid further significant rises. Six years ago, when the contract was approved, costs were put at £3.65bn. The defence project is one of the biggest ever undertaken in the UK and has been beset by construction and design delays. A government source said it had inherited a flawed contract that was now being renegotiated to ensure industry shared the burden of any future rises. The shadow defence secretary, Labour's Vernon Coaker, said: "This is the latest in a series of financial fiascos in the MoD under David Cameron. "The defence secretary's claim that he has balanced the MoD books looks increasingly nonsensical. Britain deserves better than this shambolic approach to our nation's defence." During the course of the project, an order for carrier jump jets - capable of short take-offs and vertical landings - was switched to jets with a longer range that could carry more weapons. However, in February last year, the MoD decided to revert to the original jets for logistical and financial reasons. This "U-turn" saw £74m of taxpayers' money go "down the drain", Labour's Margaret Hodge, the chairwoman of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said in September. The cross-party committee, which assesses value for money in government spending, has said it still regards the project as "a huge technical and commercial risk" and was not convinced the MoD had it under control. It said in its report that officials had made basic errors, such as failing to factor in the cost of inflation and VAT. Of the latest cost rises, the Ministry of Defence said: "Negotiations between the MoD and the Aircraft Carrier Alliance [the ship-builders] regarding the re-baselining of the Queen Elizabeth carrier programme are at an advanced stage. "No final decisions have been taken and the department will make an announcement in due course." Assembly work is taking place on both of the 65,000-tonne carriers at a specially extended dry dock at Rosyth, on the River Forth in Dunfermline. HMS Queen Elizabeth, which will not be finished until 2016 at the earliest, will be delivered before HMS Prince of Wales. The Royal Navy says the ships will carry helicopters until 2020, when the fighter jets will become available. The £6.2bn cost estimate for the project does not include buying the F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. The MoD says there are expected to be 48 jets, although this has not been confirmed. The UK currently has only one aircraft carrier - HMS Illustrious - but this cannot be used for strike aircraft, only helicopters. This has led to warnings of a decade-long capability gap. </body>

      <title>Wales 'worst' for job scheme figures</title>
      <description>Only one in nine people in Wales find long-term employment under the UK government's flagship welfare-to-work scheme, a group of MPs claims.</description>

      <body>Only one in nine people in Wales have found long-term employment under the UK government's flagship welfare-to-work scheme, a group of MPs has claimed. The Welsh Affairs Select Committee says Wales' figures are the worst in the UK. It also claims the Welsh government has prevented participants from accessing other publicly-funded training courses, hampering the programme's performance. The Welsh government said European rules meant it could not support people on the Work Programme. Both governments have schemes to try and help people find or get back into work. In Wales, the Jobs Growth Wales is aimed at unemployed people aged 16 to 24, with a job for six months paid at the national minimum wage or above, for a minimum of 25 hours per week. Meanwhile the UK government's Work Programme is designed to provide support and "work experience and training for up to two years to help people find and stay in work". Launched in June 2011, the Work Programme replaced a number of previous welfare-to-work programmes. But the Welsh Affairs Committee have criticised what it sees as "artificial barriers" between the two programmes. Conservative MP, David Davies, the committee's chair, said: "The key issue here seems to be that there is a lack of flexibility in and between the various programmes set up to get people into work, and that this lack of flexibility appears to be more marked in Wales. "It is obviously a matter of concern to us that the success rates in Wales are the lowest in Great Britain." He added: "The last thing we need in this situation is bureaucracy getting in the way of people simply being able to do what is most effective. "The fact that different programmes are funded differently or run by different organisations should not be 'visible' or create barriers at the point of delivery." Geraint Davies, Labour MP for Swansea West, told BBC Radio Wales the committee found the Welfare to Work programme was not effective, while the Welsh government's Jobs Growth Wales was twice as effective. However, he said people in the Welfare to Work Programme could not leave it to join Jobs Growth Wales, and called for the UK and Welsh governments to resolve the issue. The committee claims: The Welsh government's deputy minister for skills and technology, Ken Skates, said: "We are prepared to work constructively with the UK government to help people in Wales who are seeking work. "That said, European Social Fund (ESF) funded projects in Wales are not intended to top-up the UK government's Work Programme. "We have to ensure that we meet the European Commission demand that ESF funding is not used to duplicate or substitute the activities of the UK's own core programmes. "That's why we are currently unable to support individuals who are contracted onto the Work Programme." UK employment minister Esther McVey said: "There has been a really big improvement in performance from when the Work Programme began in 2011 and we are committed to making sure providers in Wales continue to improve the service they give to jobseekers. "Providers get paid on the results they achieve, so it's in everyone's interest to help as many people into work as possible." She said she would be meeting with Ken Skates soon and said she wanted the UK and Welsh government's "to work together to ensure jobseekers in Wales have access to the same range of help available to those in England". </body>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Home Office of "sabotage" after visas were denied for two Chinese teachers returning to work in Scotland through a partnership programme. Mr Salmond, who is currently on a visit to China, has lodged a protest. He said the move amounted to sabotage of Scottish government efforts to build cultural links. The Home Office said it was looking into the matter which was being taken seriously. The teaching programme is run by the Confucius Institute, backed by Strathclyde University and the Scottish government. It involves teachers from China offering Scottish pupils the chance to acquire skills in Mandarin and Chinese culture. Five teachers from Tian Jin municipality were due to return to Scotland for a second year, but two of them have been told their visas will not be renewed. Mr Salmond has written to UK Home Secretary Theresa May voicing his shock and dismay and warned that the episode risks damaging Scotland's relationship with China. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said: "It is an absolutely extraordinary situation you couldn't make it up. It is deeply offensive to the Chinese and it is a decision that needs to be reversed as soon as possible. "This amounts to sabotage of a programme that everyone thinks absolutely fantastic and doing great work in Scotland. "The importance of this is quite fundamental. Our argument is to have a successful economic relationship with China you must have it underpinned by a successful cultural relationship, that is the view of the Chinese, that is the view of the Scottish government. "If you undermine one you undermine the other." A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We have received the letter from the Scottish government and we have been in contact with them over these cases. "We are taking this matter seriously and will be looking into the decisions." </body>

      <title>Labour offers living wage tax breaks</title>
      <description>Firms could earn a year-long tax break if they agree to pay the so-called "living wage", under plans drawn up by Labour leader Ed Miliband.</description>

      <body>Some of Britain's lowest-paid workers could get pay rises under plans drawn up by Labour leader Ed Miliband. If the party wins the next election, Mr Miliband plans to offer firms a 12-month tax break in 2016 if they agree to pay the so-called "living wage". The pledge was cautiously welcomed by business groups, but there were fears many firms would find it unaffordable. The government said it encouraged firms to pay their lowest paid staff more provided it did not cost jobs. The living wage is an informal benchmark based on the amount an individual needs to earn to cover the basic costs of living. It is set at £8.55 an hour in London and £7.45 an hour in the rest of the UK. The national minimum wage, set by the chancellor, is significantly lower at £6.31 an hour for adults, and £5.03 for those aged 18 to 21. Under the proposals put forward by Mr Miliband, private firms would be able to claim back about a third of the cost of raising their staff members' wages to the living wage - amounting to £445 a year on average per worker, although it could potentially reach £1,000. Labour claims the plan will save money because benefit bills would go down and tax revenues would increase. But costs to businesses would rise as a result of signing up. And those that do so could only claim the money back for one year. Conservative former chancellor Ken Clarke said Mr Miliband's proposals were ill-judged "electoral bribery" that employers and the economy could ill afford. "It isn't quite free beer for the workers but it is electoral bribery really, and [Mr Miliband] is quite incapable of understanding how a country in an acute financial crisis, with an enormous fiscal deficit, can possibly afford this," said the cabinet minister. Conservative chairman Grant Shapps added: "Labour got us into a mess with too much borrowing and too much debt and now they're calling for yet more borrowing and more debt." The government said it encouraged employers to pay above the national minimum wage "when they are profitable and when it's not at expense of jobs". It said ministers were doing everything they could to "help people on low pay with the cost of living". The living wage announcement comes ahead of a speech on Tuesday in which Mr Miliband is expected to say that tackling low incomes is key to solving squeezed living standards. He is expected to warn that Britain risks "an era of growth without prosperity" as wages stagnate while household costs continue to rise. He will add: "Low wages aren't just bad for working people and their families. They are driving up the social security bill too, as the country has to subsidise more and more low paid jobs with tax credits and benefits. "So to those who say we can't afford to do anything about wages in our country today: I say we can't afford not to." Katja Hall, chief policy director for the Confederation of British Industry, said the scheme may help some firms pay more, but many companies simply could not afford it. "The best way to boost wage growth in the longer term is to build a sustainable recovery and invest in the productivity growth that will boost wages," she said. The Federation of Small Businesses said it was an "interesting proposition" but said a national insurance exemption next year could help firms increase pay sooner. The Living Wage Foundation, which encourages companies to set wages which reflect the cost of living, said paying the higher rates was necessary. The Foundation, which was set up by community group Citizens UK, runs the long-running living wage campaign backed by charities, trade unions and businesses for the introduction of a living wage. Rhys Moore, the group's director, said: "With working poverty on the rise, paying a living wage is becoming a must for every responsible employer. "We are working with businesses across the UK to help them do the right thing, so that from the chief executive to the cleaner, hard work pays." But RMT union leader Bob Crow said: "Poverty pay should not be an option and the only solution is to raise the statutory minimum wage to the current living wage rate." Updated living wage rates are due to be announced on Monday. The UK rate will be announced by Bishop of Nottingham Paul Butler, while the London rate will be set out by London Mayor Boris Johnson. It comes as it emerged the number of people paid less than the living wage grew from 4.8 million to 5.2 million in the last 12 months, according to the consultants, KPMG. And the number of children living in households earning less than the living wage has increased from 1.82 million to 1.96 million, according to research by Save the Children. </body>

      <title>Tories hire Lynton Crosby full time</title>
      <description>David Cameron signs up strategist Lynton Crosby to work full time on securing a Tory majority in 2015 in a £500,000 deal.</description>

      <body>Lynton Crosby has been signed up to work full time on securing a Conservative general election victory in a £500,000 deal. The Australian strategist has been working on a part-time basis for the party since last year. He has been credited with sharpening the Tories' campaigning style. But Labour said David Cameron still had questions to answer about Mr Crosby's tax affairs and links to the tobacco industry. Mr Crosby ran Boris Johnson's successful campaign to be re-elected as London mayor, prompting Mr Johnson to advise David Cameron to "break the piggy bank" to get him on board for the 2015 general election. His new contract secures polling services from Mr Crosby's business partner Mark Textor and support from a team of staff. Mr Crosby also helped John Howard to win four election victories in Australia, but failed to repeat that success for Conservative leader Michael Howard at the 2005 general election. Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps told The Sunday Times: "This is about ensuring we have the best possible campaign team and operation in place to secure a Conservative win in order that we can continue driving down the deficit, creating more jobs and cleaning up the mess left by years of Labour." Mr Crosby has lobbied for tobacco giant Philip Morris in the past - but denied having any influence over the government's decision to shelve plans for plain cigarette packaging in England and Wales. The tough-talking election guru is reported to have told Mr Cameron to "scrape the barnacles off the boat" by ditching extraneous policies in favour of a ruthless focus on core issues such as welfare and immigration. He has also advised the party not to worry about the rise of UKIP, arguing that a lot of their supporters will return to the Tory fold at the election. Commenting on his appointment, Labour MP Sheila Gilmore said: "Given the Tories are so keen to talk about the recruitment details of the lobbyist Lynton Crosby, perhaps they would care to finally answer the key questions surrounding his role, questions David Cameron has repeatedly dodged over recent months. "The prime minister chose to bring Lynton Crosby into the heart of his Downing Street operation, yet he has refused to answer a whole range of questions, from his tax arrangements to his influence over the prime minister's decision to scrap plans to regulate tobacco advertising. "The prime minister needs to stop dodging parliamentary questions and Freedom of Information requests and come clean. Nothing less than full disclosure will do." </body>

      <title>'Plebgate' police face fresh inquiry</title>
      <description>Officers accused of giving misleading accounts of a meeting with former cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell are facing an investigation by the police watchdog.</description>

      <body>Officers accused of giving misleading accounts of a meeting with former chief whip Andrew Mitchell are facing an investigation by the police watchdog. They will also be called back before an influential committee of MPs over evidence they gave to them previously. The Independent Police Complaints Commission said there were "procedural irregularities" in an earlier probe. The three Police Federation reps had been told they would face no action over the so-called Plebgate affair. In September 2012, Mr Mitchell was accused of calling Downing Street officers "plebs" after they refused to let him ride his bicycle through the main gates. The then cabinet member apologised for using bad language but denied using the word pleb. He later resigned as chief whip as the row continued. A month later, Mr Mitchell held a meeting in his Sutton Coldfield constituency with Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, Insp Ken MacKaill and Sgt Chris Jones from the federation in an attempt to smooth things over. After the meeting the officers, who represent rank and file officers in Warwickshire, West Mercia and West Midlands respectively, briefed the media. A transcript of a recording Mr Mitchell made of the meeting contradicted the officers' account of what was said. Ch Insp Jerry Reakes-Williams, head of professional standards at Warwickshire and West Mercia Police, carried out an investigation and concluded they had a case to answer for misconduct, but their senior officers disagreed. Now the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) has announced it will conduct its own investigation into the officers' behaviour. Det Sgt Hinton and Sgt Jones have additionally been called to reappear before the Home Affairs Select Committee after being accused of giving "misleading" answers to MPs last month. The committee wants them "to apologise for misleading it". IPCC deputy chairwoman Deborah Glass said: "Evidence given to the Home Affairs Select Committee on October 23 revealed a number of procedural irregularities between the production of the draft and final West Mercia reports. "On August 12 2013, a final report was provided to the IPCC. It contained a single set of conclusions to the effect that no case to answer for misconduct was made out against any of the three officers under investigation. "However, it is clear from CI Reakes-Williams's evidence to the Home Affairs Select Committee that this conclusion did not reflect his opinion. His opinion was (and remains) that a case to answer for misconduct was made out. "However, he mistakenly believed that his report should reflect the view of the 'appropriate authorities' - the senior officers in each of the forces involved. "The 'appropriate authorities' are the final decision-making bodies, and they are entitled to reach a different decision to the conclusions of the investigator. "However, this is an entirely separate process. The procedure described above has conflated the two." Ms Glass said she did not have the power to reopen the investigation when she gave evidence to MPs on the same day as the officers. But she has now said the investigation was incomplete because the final report did not include Ch Insp Reakes-Williams' opinion. She said the IPCC was launching its own inquiry because public confidence in the police was at stake. Labour's Keith Vaz, the home affairs committee chairman, said MPs were "appalled" by the officers' original evidence and that if they did not "correct the record" they would be in contempt of Parliament. "This resembles a great work of fiction. The fact that a 45-minute encounter in an office in Sutton Coldfield could've taken a year to investigate... beggars belief," Mr Vaz added. He said he wanted a quick resolution to the saga, which would allow the officers and Mr Mitchell to "get on with" their lives. Conservative David Davis, a former shadow home secretary and friend of Mr Mitchell, said the police officers "clearly set out to try to bring him down". "Policemen can arrest you, charge you, appear in court and give evidence against you and, generally speaking, the jury will believe the police officer so telling the truth should be fundamental to what they do in their everyday lives. "They clearly didn't do that here and their own chief constables seem to think that didn't require either a misconduct or a gross misconduct disciplinary hearing. That's astonishing, it really is," he added. Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said the select committee had done an important job in laying bare the failure of the process to deal with the meeting and the case should now be "independently re-determined." West Mercia Police said the quality of its original investigation "remains unquestioned" but it accepted there were procedural errors in the investigative reports which began with "a misunderstanding" between the IPCC and West Mercia police investigators. The force added that it had always maintained the investigation should have been conducted independently and so it welcomed the IPCC's decision to investigate using their own staff. West Midlands Police and Crime Commissioner Bob Jones said he welcomed the IPCC's decision to independently consider the investigation. </body>

      <title>McConville children recall abduction</title>
      <description>A daughter of Jean McConville, one of the Disappeared, speaks for the first time in a BBC documentary about the IRA's abduction and murder of her mother.</description>

      <body>A daughter of Jean McConville has spoken for the first time in a BBC documentary about the IRA's abduction and murder of her mother. The programme about the Disappeared also hears denials from Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams that he ordered the disappearance of Mrs McConville. The Disappeared are those who were abducted, murdered and secretly buried by republicans during the Troubles. Mrs McConville's body was found at a beach in County Louth in 2003. One of her 10 children, Agnes, described her mother's abduction, which happened in 1972. "We could hear her squealing, still squealing and looked over at the banister on Divis Flats (in west Belfast) and there she was getting thrown into the back of a van," she said. "That was the last time that we saw her." Agnes' brother Michael also recalled seeing his widowed mother being taken away. "All of us were just wrapped around her, all crying and squealing," he said. "I remember one of the girls (who abducted her) talking, who I knew because she hadn't got a mask on, she used to be a neighbour of ours, her and her sister were there. "They kept trying to calm us down, because they knew us and they knew us by name." In the programme, Mr Adams is asked about allegations that he ordered the murder of Mrs McConville. He is also asked about his knowledge of the fate of two IRA men who also disappeared the same year. "No, I had no act or part to play in either the abduction, the killing or the burial of Jean McConville or indeed any of these other individuals," he said. "My focus is in trying to do what I can as an individual to bring those remaining bodies to the families who grieve them, who want a burial place to go to. "Of course I regret, one wouldn't be a thinking, living human being if one didn't have regrets. All of us bear a responsibility, those of us who are in leadership, and I've never shirked that." Although the remains of some of the Disappeared have been recovered, seven have never been found. One of them is Columba McVeigh, a 19-year-old from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, who was abducted and murdered by the IRA in 1975. His sister, Dympna, told the programme: "I never did anything to the IRA, neither did my mum, so why are they torturing us? Thirty-eight years on and they're still torturing us and that's what it is. How would you feel if it was your brother? "I've got an image in my head of Columba standing there crying, looking into a hole. Nobody got to say goodbye to him." The first of the Disappeared to be found was north Belfast man Eamon Molloy, who was 21 when he was abducted and murdered in 1975. His body was discovered in a coffin left at Faughart graveyard near Dundalk, County Louth, in 1999. Mr Molloy's brother Martin told the documentary-makers a priest had told the family of Eamon's final moments. The Disappeared is shown at 22:35 GMT on Monday 4 November on BBC One Northern Ireland, and at 22:00 GMT on Tuesday 5 November on BBC Four. You can watch a series of additional clips on the programme's website. </body>

      <body>Scottish independence could jeopardise scientific breakthroughs, leading bacteriologist Prof Hugh Pennington has warned. Prof Pennington also said a "Yes" vote in next year's referendum could curtail the careers of young scientists. He is spearheading the new group Academics Together, an arm of the pro-UK Better Together campaign. Pro-independence campaigners said Scotland's global reputation in the area would continue. Prof Pennington, emeritus professor of bacteriology at Aberdeen University, said Britain had an integrated and internationally renowned UK research base. He explained: "I would hate to see our world-leading reputation for innovation and discovery put at risk. "I would hate to see the next big breakthrough jeopardised or see the chances of a young researcher curtailed." The scientist added: "The absence of barriers allows not just funding and people, but ideas and innovation, to flow freely across borders. "I don't want to put the success of Scotland's world-leading research at risk." Better Together leader Alistair Darling said Scottish research facilities and universities in Scotland got a disproportionately high share of UK research funding. He added: "We make up around 8% of the UK population but get over 13% of UK research funding in return. "That is a clear, positive benefit of being part of the UK." A spokesman for the pro-independence Yes Scotland campaign said: "There is no doubt that deciding higher education policy in Scotland rather than at Westminster has been of huge benefit to our universities, students and academics and that will continue with independence." The people of Scotland go to the polls on Thursday, 18 September, next year when they will be asked the straight "yes/no" questions: "Should Scotland be an independent country." </body>

      <title>Firms urged to bid for £20m jobs pot</title>
      <description>Smaller businesses in Wales are urged to apply for a share of £20m worth of funding for growth and job creation by the economy minister.</description>

      <body>Smaller businesses in Wales have been urged to apply for a share of a £20m pot towards growth and job creation by the economy minister. Edwina Hart said the Wales Economic Growth Fund had already proved a "lifeline for many businesses" with £9m paid out to 135 firms this year. Firms are invited to bid for at least £100,000 in the latest phase. Mrs Hart claimed the second round of funding had a potential to create or safeguard 3,000 jobs. The first round offered grants of between £50,000 and £100,000. It is estimated the money already paid out will result in the creation of 980 jobs and nearly 800 more safeguarded, with ministers anticipating "strong interest" in the next round of applications. One of those to receive money in the first round was Japanese-owned car parts factory G-TEM. It employs 150 people in Ebbw Vale, supplying Honda UK and Toyota with welded body parts. The company received £95,000 which is helping it take on 10 extra workers. Nick Thomas, deputy managing director of G-TEM, said: "We recognised the opportunity to expand production capacity at our press and assembly plant on the Rassau Industrial Estate. "Thanks to the investment from the Economic Growth Fund we are now able to complete this work and take on more staff at this site." Mrs Hart added: "I want to ensure Welsh businesses have access to the finance they need to grow and create jobs. "The Welsh government's Economic Growth Fund has provided a lifeline for many businesses unable to access support for growth through traditional sources." Welsh businesses have until 16 December to express an interest in applying before full applications are taken in the new year. Michael Learmond of the Federation of Small Business in north Wales welcomed the funding but said some companies could do with more time to develop ideas. "If you have a project on the stocks which is ready to roll then this is fine but there will be businesses with ideas which they want to get off the ground and they will want more time than a deadline in December," he said. Mr Learmond added that promoting the fund and the range of support was also vital. </body>

      <title>HS2 : Which cities to benefit?</title>
      <description>A new report says Nottingham and Derby will benefit the most from HS2.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24747301</url>

      <body>Like anyone with a favourite train set, David Cameron isn't about to give up on HS2. In Prime Minister's Questions, he robustly defended the need for a high-speed rail link. With Labour now questioning the overall cost, HS2 supporters may be getting rather nervous. That explains why the government has published another document - the fifth so far - on the benefits for our big cities. This time, the key message is the economic spin-offs, rather than the shorter journey times promised by the new line to London. And tucked away in the details of the Department for Transport's "Strategic Case for HS2" is the finding of a KPMG audit of the benefits for the regions. Its model is based on improved connectivity: how businesses are able to connect with suppliers and potential customers. Its findings put a figure on that, and guess what: Nottingham and Derby emerge as the "city region" that will benefit the most from high speed rail. The KPMG conclusion estimates a big improvement in business connectivity. This is the league table for the city regions along the route: The government's HS2 report also estimates what that could be worth for the Nottingham/Derby economy: an extra £2.2bn a year. But does that still make HS2 worth it? That's where the political and economic debate still remains. "We are always supportive of infrastructure projects, even HS2. But they have to provide good value for money," Ron Lynch, head of the business organisation, the Institute of the Directors in the East Midlands, said. HS2 opponent and Tory MP Andrew Bridgen believes Labour doubts over the £42bn cost now put the whole idea in doubt. The proposed route would cut through his North West Leicestershire constituency, with an HS2 rail tunnel going under East Midlands Airport. "A whole raft of independent bodies - even the Treasury Select Committee a couple of weeks ago - said there is no business case for HS2 and that it should be suspended," he told me. Labour's current position is best summed up by Shadow Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood, herself a Nottingham MP. "We are in favour, but the government can't be irresponsible about the cost. They've got to keep that cost under control and they've got to demonstrate to the public it's value for money," she said. When the East Midlands HS2 station - between Derby and Nottingham - is built at Toton Sidings, London will be 51 minutes away, it will be 19 minutes to Birmingham, and it'll be one hour 42 minutes to Newcastle. It's that prospect of such shorter journey times and the economic advantages that attract the leader of Nottingham City Council, Labour's Jon Collins. "There's an opportunity for us to get a rebalancing of the economy, so that not all the growth is happening in and around London and South East, " he said. "We'll see significant economic growth and economic benefits coming to the Midlands and the North from HS2. That's why people should strongly support it." In the national debate over the economic spin-offs for the English regions, the advantage for Nottingham and Derby has barely figured. The two cities' top position in the HS2 economic benefits league table may surprise many. But ponder this: at the last general election, the East Midlands helped deliver David Cameron into Downing Street. The East Midlands may help deliver HS2 for the prime minister, if the economic case for this region wins over the sceptics. </body>

      <body>"Predictions in politics are inherently unreliable because they are, by definition, merely projections of the present". So said the late lamented doyen of journalists, authors and satirists, Malcolm Muggeridge. His words of wisdom offer a timely warning to any of us who may be tempted to scan the daily outpourings of opinion pollsters in the hope of divining the likely outcome of the 2015 General Election. What if, for example, the 2014/15 winter is plagued by power cuts? Or further hikes in energy prices? Aren't these exactly the sorts of shocks, (absolutely no pun intended) that could lead to the number-crunchers themselves being given a good crunching? But I mustn't fall into exactly the same trap St Mugg was warning us about: just because energy is the "hot button" issue now doesn't mean that it will be equally highly-charged in 18 months' time. If Muggeridge were around today, he would probably urge us to be just as circumspect about the so-called 'UKIP factor'. Suitably forewarned and forearmed, here goes: The conventional wisdom is that it will. A poll by the former Conservative deputy chairman Lord Ashcroft recently suggested UKIP could draw so much support from Tories in marginal seats they might otherwise win from Labour, and in others that they might otherwise hold, that a new slogan was born: "Vote UKIP, get Labour". A less fashionable view comes from the West Midlands MEP Mike Nattrass. Elected as a UKIP MEP, he resigned from the party last month and now sits as an Independent. He says UKIP's immigration policies will hit Ed Miliband's party hardest of all in their key seats. Incidentally, Mr Nattrass currently sits as an Independent MEP in the European Parliament. Which means both the successful UKIP candidates in the last European Elections in 2009 have now left the party to form new ones: Nikki Sinclaire will be standing for the We Demand a Referendum Now Party. We all know about "Super Tuesday" in the US Presidential merry-go-round. But save the date: Thursday, 22 May, 2014 will see polling not only for hundreds of seats in 19 local authorities across our region, but also for the seven seats representing nearly six million West Midlanders in the next European Parliament. Part of the calculation is that by delaying the council elections so that they fall on the same day, each set of elections will bolster turnouts in the other. UKIP's poll ratings encourage them to believe they can improve on the two European seats they secured last time. They hope this would give them a stronger springboard into 2015 than they managed last time. By the time of the 2010 general election they suffered the dreaded "squeeze" so often endured by the "smaller parties" and fell back to just 4% of the vote. Even allowing for Muggeridge's warnings, UKIP's recent poll ratings certainly encourage them to believe they are on the brink of a fundamental shift in British politics which mean they are a "smaller party" no longer. There is no question that UKIP have broadened their message beyond their original single issue campaign: I have marvelled at how effectively they rallied their popular (or should that be populist?) campaigns themes; emphasising their anti High-Speed Rail credentials in some places and their pro-local hospital commitments in others. How will all this gel together into a coherent theme for next year's European Elections? That will be one of the questions I shall be putting to Jill Seymour, the chair of Kynnerlsey Parish Council in Shropshire. But more to the point she was also recently named in first position on UKIP's candidates' list for next May. And she will be one of my guests on this week's Sunday Politics from 11.00 on BBC One in the West Midlands. And I hope you will be able to join us too. </body>

      <title>Q&amp;A: Beginner's guide to PM's speech</title>
      <description>David Cameron delivers his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Here's an at-a-glance guide.</description>

      <body>David Cameron has delivered his long-awaited speech on the UK's relations with the EU. Why is the speech so significant? What has happened? Prime Minister David Cameron has delivered a speech (full text) setting out his views on the UK's future in the European Union. The speech has been months in the planning. Why the big deal about the speech? Mr Cameron had been facing mounting pressure from within the Eurosceptic ranks of his own Conservative Party, and the UK Independence Party, who are unhappy with the current relationship between the UK and the European Union. There have been calls for a referendum to be held, and his own MPs want to see action on the Conservative election pledge to "bring back" powers to Westminster from Brussels. For months now, the promise has been that these questions will all be answered in a big speech. So what did Cameron say? Mr Cameron said he plans to renegotiate parts of the UK's relations with Europe and put that changed membership package to the British people in an in-out referendum after the next general election, by the end of 2017. That, obviously, also depends on the Conservatives winning a majority in 2015. To see more of what he said, here are selection of key extracts from the speech. What sorts of powers does the UK want back? The prime minister did not spell this out in his speech, but there is a cross-government audit currently under way looking at where the EU has powers over life in the UK. The idea is that each one will then be examined to see whether it is necessary or whether the power could be "brought back" to the UK. Areas it might include are the Working Time Directive, which imposes employment rules such as limiting the working week and giving EU workers a minimum number of holidays each year. The UK is also keen on opt-outs from policing and criminal justice measures. The 2010 Conservative manifesto said: "We will work to bring back key powers over legal rights, criminal justice and social and employment legislation to the UK." Why does Cameron think he can agree changes with EU leaders? The recent eurozone crisis has led those countries using the single currency to believe that they need closer integration in future - a move which will further increase the gap between the euro and non-euro EU members. Mr Cameron says there needs to be a new EU treaty to facilitate the eurozone integration, so, as part of negotiations, there is a chance to redefine the membership rules for countries like the UK. So does this all mean that the UK's going to leave the EU? David Cameron said that he opposed the idea of the UK leaving the EU (the UK joined when it was the European Economic Community, in 1973). However he did say during a recent BBC radio interview: "Would Britain collapse if we left the European Union? No, of course not. You could choose a different path. The question is, what is in our national interest? I've always been very clear it's in our national interest as a trading nation to be in the single market." What has been the reaction in the UK? Eurosceptics seem pretty happy with the speech - it has been very warmly welcomed by Conservative MPs. Although the UK Independence Party said it wanted a referendum sooner, party leader Nigel Farage called the PM's promise of an in/out referendum his party's greatest achievement. Pro-Europeans have been unhappy with the speech - Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg warned that proposing a referendum at a future date causes uncertainty and will have a "chilling effect" on jobs and growth. Ex-European Commissioner and Labour cabinet minister Lord Mandelson called it "game, set and match" to the hardliners in Mr Cameron's party. The BBC has compiled a selection of political and industry responses to the speech. Here is a round-up of newspaper commentators' verdicts. What about the reaction around Europe? The BBC's Steve Evans in Berlin said opinion was hardening in Germany and France, with many politicians believing that those opposed to further European integration would be better off "leaving gracefully". Guido Westerwelle, German foreign minister, said "cherry picking is not an option". French foreign minister Laurent Fabius said: "We want the British to be able to bring all their positive characteristics to Europe... but you can't do Europe a la carte. I'll take an example which our British friends will understand. Let's imagine Europe is a football club and you join, but once you're in it you can't say, 'Let's play rugby'." Read more EU reaction. What about the reaction from business? A succession of business leaders have spoken up in favour of UK membership of the EU and the US and a range of European politicians have also warned of negative results if the UK left the EU. Some business leaders, such as IG Group founder Stuart Wheeler and Next boss Lord Wolfson, have also called for changes in the UK's relationship with the EU. The director general of the employers' group the CBI, John Cridland, said "closer union of the eurozone is not for us" but Mr Cameron "rightly recognises the benefits of retaining membership of what must be a reformed EU".

      <body>Here are details of Ed Miliband's ministerial team following his October 2013 reshuffle. The then 40-year-old beat older brother and former foreign secretary David to the Labour leadership in 2010 by the narrowest of margins, with the backing of the trade unions proving decisive. Attempted to shake-off his "Red Ed" tag by talking about the "squeezed middle" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction. He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on "refounding" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011. As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, at the age of 44, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. Popular throughout the party, the then 42-year old got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. Aged 43, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury. Turning 40 in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the age of 56. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. The MP for Leeds West was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament. A former employment lawyer turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty. Regarded as more pragmatic than his father, he was a union official and special adviser to then education and employment minister David Blunkett before becoming an MP in 1999. Well-regarded as international development and environment secretary under Gordon Brown despite having a generally low profile. At the age of 53 stood for the deputy leadership in 2007, coming fourth. One of Ed Miliband's primary supporters in the leadership contest. One of the most high profile Muslim MPs, the then 40-year-old was an early backer of Ed Miliband to be Labour leader and went on to run his campaign. Before becoming an MP in 2005 he was a leading human rights solicitor and chairman of pressure group Liberty. He is a former government whip, local government minister and transport minister, who was promoted to shadow transport secretary when Lord Adonis stood down after the 2010 general election. Since taking on the justice brief, he has admitted Labour did not do enough to tackle reoffending but accused the coalition of focusing on cutting costs not crime. Leading light in Labour think tanks The Fabian Society and Progress. Moving to defence from shadow Northern Ireland secretary in October 2013, the MP for Gedling held several ministerial positions in the last Labour government. One of those jobs was to look after policing - something he continued in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. He was also minister for drugs and crime reduction under Tony Blair and sparked controversy, given that role, when he admitted having smoked cannabis as a student. Mr Coaker first entered Parliament in 1997, aged 43, having failed to win seats in both 1992 and 1987. Married with two children, he's also a former government whip. The then 47-year old caused a stir in 2009 when she quit the government and accused Gordon Brown of regarding her and other senior women in the Cabinet as "window dressing". Like many leading female MPs, the former union worker entered Parliament in the 1997 Labour landslide. Responsible for the controversial eco-town project as housing minister before becoming Europe minister in 2008. Supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. A beneficiary of Ed Miliband's first reshuffle, she moved from the communities and local government brief in October 2011. One of twin sisters in the shadow cabinet, the MP for Wallasey in Merseyside joined the Labour party when she was 17. The former union official was present on the Labour frontbench throughout the Blair and Brown years, without ever making the Cabinet. Her middle-ranking roles included social security minister and pensions minister. One of Labour's first openly gay MPs, she formed a civil partnership with her long-term partner in 2008. She supported David Miliband in the leadership contest. In Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle, at the age of 50, she was shifted to shadow leader of the Commons from shadow chief secretary to the Treasury. Chris Leslie has been appointed shadow chief secretary to the Treasury in the latest Labour frontbench reshuffle. The former Bradford councillor was elected MP for Shipley - a Tory stronghold in Yorkshire - in 1997. He held several junior positions in the former Labour government within the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He lost his Shipley seat in 2005, but re-entered Parliament in 2010 as MP for Nottingham East. He went on to serve as shadow financial secretary to the Treasury on Labour's front bench in the Commons. Mary Creagh has moved from shadow environment secretary to shadow transport secretary in October 2013. When she was appointed to Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet in October 2010, the then 42-year old had never held a frontbench role before. The Wakefield MP worked for the European Parliament and in academia before entering Parliament in 2005. A keen Europhile, she is fluent in French and Italian. Worked as parliamentary private secretary to Andy Burnham but voted for David Miliband in the leadership contest. Maria Eagle moved in October 2013 to shadow environment secretary in a job swap with Mary Creagh. She is the sister of Angela but chose to support Ed Miliband in the leadership contest. Ms Eagle was a solicitor in Liverpool before entering Parliament in 1997. She held a series of ministerial positions under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, including children's minister and equalities minister. Like her twin, she lists cricket as one of her interests and is a proficient chess player. Jim Murphy was moved - demoted in many people's eyes - in October 2013 from shadow defence secretary. He is a Blairite who worked on David Miliband's leadership campaign. He has held a string of government jobs since entering Parliament in 1997, after snatching the Conservative Party's safest seat in Scotland. He served Labour in power as a whip, Cabinet Office minister, welfare minister, Europe minister and, finally, at the age of 41, Scottish secretary. The East Renfrewshire MP is a former president of the National Union of Students, who lists his hobbies as model trains and playing football. Previously an MSP, Ms Curran represented Glasgow Bailliestone since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. But when that constituency was torn up in boundary changes she made the move to Westminster in 2010. Under her, Labour took back Glasgow East having lost it in a by-election defeat by the SNP in 2008. In Holyrood, she held various posts, including minister for communities, overseeing the executive's flagship anti-social behaviour laws. Before entering politics she was a lecturer in community education. The then 52-year-old took up her first full shadow cabinet role in October 2011. Jon Trickett takes over from the departing Tom Watson as deputy Labour party chair. Gordon Brown's former parliamentary aide, Mr Trickett previously attended shadow cabinet as a junior minister and became a full member as shadow Cabinet Office minister in Ed Miliband's 2011 reshuffle. The then 61-year-old MP for Hemsworth took over the role from Tessa Jowell. Michael Dugher became shadow Cabinet Office minister in October 2013 after attending the shadow cabinet as shadow minister without portfolio. Mr Dugher won the seat of Barnsley East at the 2010 General Election, after serving as chief political spokesman for the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown. Having joined the ranks of the Labour parliamentary party, he then became a parliamentary private secretary to the Leader of the Opposition, Ed Miliband. He is also currently vice-chairman of the Labour Party. Gloria De Piero was appointed shadow women and equalities minister in the October 2013 reshuffle. The former GMTV political editor was an political admirer of Tony Blair and backed David Miliband as party leader. She was elected as MP for Ashfield at the 2010 General Election and appointed to a junior role in the shadow Department for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport. Since October 2011, Ms De Piero has served as a junior shadow Home Office minister. Former BBC radio producer and special adviser who has risen quickly through the ranks. The then 40-year-old was elected in 2010 for Pontypridd, but previously stood unsuccessfully in the 2006 Blaenau Gwent by-election where he lost to independent Dai Davies. He supported Ed Miliband for the leadership and was given a role in his shadow team five months after entering the House, first as shadow Wales minister and then in the shadow Treasury team. This is his first shadow cabinet role. Moving from shadow minister for international development in October 2013, former charity worker and chief executive of the Manchester Jewish Federation, Mr Lewis held a string of junior ministerial posts in the Labour government after becoming an MP in 1997 at the age of 31. He started out as a parliamentary private secretary to then Trade Secretary Stephen Byers, before going on to be an education minister, Treasury minister, health minister and international development minister. Most recently, he was minister of state at the Foreign Office. His previous shadow cabinet role was as culture spokesman in which he was a vocal campaigner on phone hacking. The then 52-year-old was elected unopposed in a ballot for chief whip in 2010. A former local government minister, the Doncaster Central MP is responsible for maintaining discipline among Labour MPs in crucial Commons votes. Continues to lead her party in the Lords, having done the job, while in government, under Gordon Brown. She is also a spokesman on education, work and pensions, Northern Ireland and equality issues. Born in 1955, she started her political career as a special adviser to Neil - now Lord - Kinnock in the 1980s. A long-serving leader of Brighton and Hove Council, Lord Bassam was given a peerage in 1997 at the age of 44. The former local government official has continued as Labour's chief whip in the Lords, having done the job since before the 2010 general election. </body>

      <body>The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) chair and a vice chair will answer Plebgate questions on Tuesday afternoon, the chair of the Home Affairs Committee has told the BBC. Keith Vaz told Daily Politics presenter Jo Coburn that they will appear before his committee, as he wants to know why the IPCC initially said it would not look at the matter again, but later changed its mind. Police officers who previously appeared before the committee, and were asked about their meeting with Andrew Mitchell, are being recalled and Mr Vaz said it would give them the "opportunity to put the record straight". He said inquiries so far had seen costs of "a third of a million pounds and hundreds of police officers have been involved", over a 45-minute conversation 12 months ago, and he said: "I hope we will have closure".

      <body>Four in five British people want a ban on the wearing of the niqab in public places, but the UK government looks unlikely to bring in legislation. The wearing of the veil, along with attitudes to women, the radicalisation of some young British Muslims, sexual exploitation and grooming cases, forced marriages, and honour-based violence raise questions for Muslims in Britain today. Giles Dilnot reports on how British Muslim communities confront these issues, days after the World Islamic Economic Forum was hosted for the first time in London.

Conservative MP Harriett Baldwin, who used to work in City banking, said the Westminster Parliament was "a lot more civilised than some other work environments", but reckoned both men and women MPs had to put up with insults. Labour's Fiona Mactaggart said: "We need to get the voices of women in leadership positions if we are going to deal with this issue", and she spoke in favour of all-women shortlists for seats. French MP Axelle Lemaire, whose Northern Europe seat includes the UK, said France was considering fines for parties which did not put up an equal number of women candidates for election.

      <title>Change of tone for Labour on HS2?</title>
      <description>Has there been a change in Labour's thinking about HS2?</description>

      <body>Do I detect a small change in tone from Ed Balls on high speed rail, a little softening of the usual critique? Today the shadow chancellor repeated his party's scepticism about the project in his speech to the CBI. He warned about keeping a check on rising costs and deployed the usual language about not giving the government "a blank cheque". Here is an excerpt: "The Labour Party cannot - and will not - give the government a blank cheque. That is what you would expect from any credible official opposition seeing a government desperately mismanaging a project. "And that is what is happening here with the costs having shot up to £50bn. Indeed, the costs have gone up by a staggering £10bn in the last year, so I of course welcome the prime minister's belated recognition that he needs to get a grip. "As you at the CBI have said recently: 'The increased costs of HS2 are a matter of concern. For HS2 to go ahead it has to wash its face. The value for money test has to be properly applied.' "We agree - and we will put the national interest and the taxpayer interest first. "We will take a hard-headed look at the costs and benefits of the scheme to ensure this is the best way to spend £50bn for the future of our country." But note that last sentence. Labour's priority now, he said, is to ensure that HS2 is the best way to spend £50bn. The implicit assumption in his language is that Labour wants the project to go ahead but will make sure money is not wasted. There is less explicit doubt about whether Labour would support HS2. Contrast this with what Mr Balls told Victoria Derbyshire on BBC 5Live on 25 October: "What I am saying is that we need to know the costs are under control and the benefits are real. "And if we judged that it wasn't in the national interest, we would not go ahead. And if it is in the national interest, if this is the best way to spend £16bn on transport in the next Parliament and the extra billions in the years after, then we'll give it the go-ahead. "But, at this stage, I genuinely don't think that the evidence is there, the case has been made. The National Audit Office has been very critical and the government can't answer the questions. "In those circumstances, it would be irresponsible for me to say, regardless of the benefits, we are going to pull the plug, but it is also really irresponsible for me to say 'well OK, whatever it costs and however obscure the benefits, we will go ahead anyway'." Mr Balls' explicit argument then was that if the arguments about cost and benefits did not stack up, then Labour would not support the project. Labour's support was much more in the balance. He made a similar point in his party conference speech in September, when he said: "Under this government the High Speed 2 project has been totally mismanaged and the costs have shot up to £50bn. David Cameron and George Osborne have made clear they will go full steam ahead with this project - no matter how much the costs spiral up and up. "They seem willing to put their own pride and vanity above best value for money for the taxpayer. "Labour will not take this irresponsible approach. So let me be clear, in tough times - when there is less money around and a big deficit to get down - there will be no blank cheque from me as a Labour chancellor for this project, or for any project. "Because the question is - not just whether a new High Speed line is a good idea or a bad idea, but whether it is the best way to spend £50bn for the future of our country." That crucial first question - whether or not HS2 is a good or bad idea - appears now to have been answered by Labour; it certainly has disappeared from Mr Balls' public pronouncements. Mr Balls' aides insist that the position has not changed, that I am reading too much into this, that Labour's future support for HS2 has still yet to be determined. And I know that, to some, this might appear arcane Westminster kremlinology. But if Ed Balls is shifting his language on how £50bn of your and my tax pounds may be spent, on an issue of public policy where Labour's long-term support matters hugely, that is interesting. </body>

      <title>Europe: The fight for UK hearts and minds</title>
      <description>Big business joins battle for UK role in Europe</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-24801895</url>
      <date>1383574255</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70897000/jpg/_70897590_1524742f-266d-442b-8c2b-8b523233a3f6.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>It used to be said, perhaps first by Calvin Coolidge, that: "What's good for business is good for America." In the UK the main business lobbying organisation the CBI has joined the debate about Britain's future in Europe. Its argument can be summed up as: "What's good for business is good for Britain." A lengthy study, according to the CBI's director general John Cridland, came "to the unequivocal conclusion that British business, large and small, wants to remain within a reformed EU". The CBI has produced an array of statistics concluding that membership of the EU is worth an extra 4-5% of GDP which translates into £78bn a year for the economy. That is presented as the equivalent of £1,225 per individual or £3,000 per household. The CBI wants to define the choice for the British people as "in with reform" or "out with no influence". It is a position supported by the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and by David Cameron who told the CBI's annual conference that he could secure a "yes" vote in a promised referendum. The kind of reforms the CBI would be looking for would include less red tape, removing barriers to e-commerce, and ring-fencing national employment law from EU directives. Despite the CBI's enthusiasm for staying in the EU it does register unease about the creeping extension of EU authority. The CBI's intervention in this debate follows a drum-beat of statements from the business community; the first salvos in a three-year campaign to get the British people to vote "yes" to Europe. So we have had Gerry Grimstone, the chairman of financial services industry body TheCityUK saying: "I do not believe the City's pre-eminent position will survive if we lose our role as Europe's financial capital." We have had a report entitled Manufacturing: Our future in Europe which concluded that 85% of UK manufacturing firms support EU membership. Other indicators have been more cautious. There was a YouGov survey, published by the campaign group Business for Britain, which reported that - by a majority of 46% to 37% - company bosses believed that the costs of complying with the single market outweighed the benefits of staying in the EU. In October, the think tank Open Europe estimated that the top 100 EU laws cost the UK economy £27.4bn a year. So the battleground is being marked out. It is much less about a fundamental re-negotiation of Britain's relationship with the EU. It is more about reforming the EU. It is the road that the rest of Europe is trying to channel the British debate down. Numerous EU leaders have made it clear that Britain will not be able to cherry pick what it likes or dislikes. There will be no tolerance of further British exceptionalism. Senior German officials have been loud and clear; they are open to reforms if they are for all 28 EU members. So David Cameron's emphasis, in recent times, has been on making the EU work better. He tried to make the recent summit about cutting red tape. He came armed with a little booklet explaining how "sweeping away barriers to growth" would "benefit all of Europe". The Commission has eagerly supported some of this agenda. They have said that 74% of Europeans believe the EU generates too much red tape. President Barroso has said the EU should be "big on big things and smaller on small things". In Brussels it is said that there was "blood on the wall" when some regulations were withdrawn by the Commission. There is a message here. The Commission is saying there is flexibility over reviewing legislation on a case-by-case basis to gauge its impact on competitiveness but the door is closed to a fundamental re-negotiation about the competences of the EU. Speaking at the CBI conference, David Cameron said: "The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It is a long-term strategic choice for Britain: let us reform this organisation. Let us make changes to how it works, and then let's put those changes to the British people in a referendum." He was clear that EU membership is "overwhelmingly in Britain's economic interests". So as the argument about Britain's future in Europe develops it appears less about the repatriation of powers or challenging the commitment to "ever closer union" but more about making the EU work more efficiently, with the prime minister being urged to go out and build an alliance for reform. The question is whether this kind of "reformed" EU will be enough to convince the British public, whose support for EU membership was described again by the prime minister as "wafer thin". </body>

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24765783</url>
      <date>1383311222</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70837000/jpg/_70837867_badger.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <title>Hidden story of the Disappeared</title>
      <description>New documentary tells hidden story of Northern Ireland's Troubles</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-24765480</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70850000/jpg/_70850741_jeanmcconville2.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>"Can you imagine being a little boy and watching men and women come and take your mother?" These words open a chilling new documentary telling the hidden story of the Disappeared; at least 15 people who were murdered and buried in secret graves by the IRA during Northern Ireland's Troubles. Some of their bodies have never been found. Presenter Darragh McIntyre hears the previously untold stories of many of the relatives left to grieve for decades while never quite knowing the fate of their loved ones. The voice of Seamus Heaney reading his poem, the Bog Queen, can be heard at the start and end of the programme over stark footage of the vast marshlands in various parts of the Republic of Ireland where the bodies are believed to lie within. One family that did finally receive closure was that of Jean McConville, a widow and mother-of-10 who was dragged from her home in west Belfast. Her body was recovered in 2003 on a beach in County Louth in the Republic of Ireland. Her daughter Agnes gives her first broadcast interview since her mother's remains were discovered. In one poignant moment, her interview is intercut with footage of her as a child just weeks after her mother's disappearance where she says: "We'll keep our fingers crossed and pray for her to come back." While the dramatic story initially attracted the attention of the media in the weeks around Christmas 1972, republicans sent out the message that she was merely "in hiding" because of the publicity; headlines like "Missing mother reported to be back in Belfast" began emerging. Agnes McConville said she and her siblings were hearing a different story "Children growing up around Divis flats would hear what their parents were saying. Your mummy's a tout, she's this and that, your mummy will never be back, she's gone with a British soldier - this wasn't coming from the adults, it was coming from the children," she said. Within months the children were split up in various care homes across Northern Ireland. Sinn Féin president Gerry Adams is repeatedly pressed in the documentary about allegations he was involved in the disappearance of Mrs McConville - allegations he repeatedly rejects. Documentary maker Alison Millar said when she saw the moving footage from 1972 of the McConville children talking about their mother, she had been determined to track down Agnes. "She had never seen the famous clip, and she just kept saying 'they could have killed me, I said all that as a child, where did I get the strength from?'" She said the access they got to the families involved a period of building up a rapport. "We started meeting families 18 months ago and we didn't start filming until early this year," she said. "A lot of my work is from that tradition of film-making where most of your time is tea and biscuits, and the last bit is where you work it all out. "The relationships were built up by both myself and Darragh by just talking to people." This intimacy has led to moving encounters with several relatives of the Disappeared who have previously not been in the spotlight. The programme also hears the story of the priest who gave the last rites to Eamon Molloy before he was executed. His body was found at an old cemetery between the border and Dundalk, County Louth, in 1999. Phil Smyth shows a photograph she took of her 17-year-old nephew Kevin McKee on the day he went missing. The youngest of all the Disappeared, his body has never been found. Alison Millar said it was "tough viewing" for the families who were given a preview of the documentary. "It's very raw still and while maybe they were fine watching their own story, when they saw something like Kathleen Armstrong talking to her husband Charlie at his grave, they were deeply moved," she said. Darragh McIntyre said the use of Seamus Heaney's poetry was "unconventional but adds a lot to the film". "I sent him a fax to get permission as that was the way you'd communicate with him - I explained the exact context of how we wanted to use it. "We got a note back saying he was delighted and that he felt the poem was suitable to be used in this way." He says that while the film examines a dark chapter in Northern Ireland's past, the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims Remains - which co-ordinates searches and obtains information in confidentiality - is hopeful that it may result in fresh leads. "This is a current story - seven people are still missing, and four of them are probably within 40 minutes of Dublin city centre, in bogs in County Meath," he said. The Disappeared is shown at 22:35 GMT on Monday 4 November on BBC One Northern Ireland, and at 22:00 GMT on Tuesday 5 November on BBC Four. A series of additional clips are available on the programme's website. </body>

      <title>Is the energy market structurally flawed?</title>
      <description>Is the energy market structurally flawed?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24741664</url>
      <date>1383125923</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70795000/jpg/_70795464_robertpeston.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>So what would be the point of an investigation of the energy industry by the Competition Commission, which is what Tony Cocker, the chief executive of the UK arm of German giant Eon, called for on Tuesday? Mr Cocker is not a lone voice in the industry. The boss of another foreign-owned big player in our market, Vincent de Rivaz of EDF, has for a couple of years been asking for the same thing - although Mr Cocker has gone a bit further than Mr de Rivaz by writing to the prime minister, the Energy Minister Ed Davey and the energy regulator, Ofgem, to formally request such a probe. For both Cocker and de Rivaz, the ostensible motive is that such an independent and detailed investigation is a necessary pre-condition of winning back the trust and confidence of customers and the political class - whom they acknowledge have been completely alienated over the past few years by price rises that have wrecked British people's living standards and are rarely understood. But, for the avoidance of doubt, this is not a cheap public relations stunt. Once an investigation is launched - and I am told that the prime minister is very close to initiating one - a cloud of expensive uncertainty will descend on the industry. (And, by the way, on Wednesday morning Mr Davey's department put out something of a non-committal response.) Mr de Rivaz has told me that his company - and by implication his industry - has "nothing to hide", which is why he thinks an inquiry would be a good thing. But that is only partly relevant. Even if the companies are not colluding to rig prices or deliberately exploiting excessive market power to fatten profits in an unfair way - and they insist they are not - any Competition Commission inquiry would have to examine whether there are structural flaws in the industry which mean that competition does not serve consumers' interests adequately. That is why such a review is supported by one of the more influential voices on competition in the UK, the former head of the Office of Fair Trading, John Fingleton. And because such a review would be so serious, the companies would find it more expensive to raise money for investment - their cost of capital would increase - until it became clear whether the Competition Commission would force radical change on the industry, such as breaking up the big six players. The big question that any Competition Commission probe would have to answer is whether it is good or bad for consumers, and for the British economy, that energy companies are allowed both to generate power and sell it to us. Does this vertical integration allow the energy giants to invest for the long term, confident they have a captive market, thus making sure that the UK has ample supplies of relatively cheap energy over the longer term? This is what Mr de Rivaz would claim, citing the example of France, whose massive investments in nuclear power over decades by vast and integrated EDF has led to French people enjoying cheaper power than the British and some of the cheapest electricity in Europe. Or does this combination of so-called upstream and downstream activities set up a conflict of interest to the detriment of customers - in that integrated companies have less of an incentive to keep retail prices as low as possible, since higher prices boost the profits of their generators and the value of whatever gas reserves they hold? There is a related issue of whether the current regulator, Ofgem, is fit for purpose. Any referral of the industry to the Competition Commission would probably be in a slap in the face for Ofgem, since it has argued that the industry suffers from behavioural rather than structural weakness. And it is trying to secure a better deal for consumers by forcing the big companies to be open and more transparent about their charges and profitability. The concern in government and at Ofgem about a Competition Commission investigation is that it would be a further deterrent to investment in new generating capacity, at a time when the UK is perilously close to seeing the lights go out because so much old plant is being decommissioned. That said, some argue that the game is up anyway till after the election - in that (with the exception of the recent Hinkley Point C nuclear deal, which will take many years to build and had cross party support) the party conference statement of Ed Miliband that as prime minister he would freeze prices may be leading to an investment hiatus in any case. What is striking is the dog that hasn't barked: the debate is largely about how competition can be improved. But none of the big parties is arguing that the UK should more closely follow the French model and revert to greater direction and state ownership of the industry. And perhaps that is why Cocker and de Rivaz favour a Competition Commission probe - to ward off the more serious threat to them of a return to explicit government control. </body>

      <title>Can you persuade people not to buy stolen goods?</title>
      <description>Can you persuade people not to buy £100 stolen laptops?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24745784</url>

      <body>What's the best way to dissuade people from buying stolen goods? Past experience suggests there's a way to make it socially beyond the pale. A man comes up to you in the pub. "Nudge, nudge," he says, conspiratorially. "Can I interest you in a brand new laptop. Perfect nick. £100. Say no more." Of course, you assume that the shiny machine is almost certainly stolen. So what does one do? You know the correct answer is to say you'd make a citizen's arrest while the landlord telephones the local constable. But the black market in stuff that just might have fallen off the back of a lorry predates lorries and probably the invention of the wheel. For many people, getting a bargain trumps the technicalities of Section 22 of the Theft Act 1968. Especially if they think the risks of being caught are about zero. But without a market in stolen goods, there would be no property crime and the misery that goes with it. As Patrick Colquhoun wrote in 1796 in A Treatise on the Police of the Metropolis, "deprive a thief of a safe and ready market for his goods, and he is undone". I mention all this because of a submission that has been sent to the Justice Select Committee. It suggests that, when it comes to the black market, "nudge, nudge, say no more" is not the problem but the possible solution. Allow me to explain. In 1979, 28 people a day were killed or seriously injured by drunk drivers. Thirty years later and the number had been reduced to four. What had changed? The Department of Transport asked the same question last year when it produced a short research paper. The analysis concluded that the fall in drink driving wasn't just down to tougher punishments and greater enforcement. It was down to a brilliant bit of nudging. The nudge in this case was an advertising campaign between 1987 and 1992 that, in the words of the transport minister at the time, was about "changing the water in which the fish swim". The campaign set out to produce a sea-change in the social acceptability of drink driving. The brief was to create nothing less than disgust at those who drank and then drove. You may remember the ads: Before the campaign 51% of men agreed "it is difficult to avoid some drinking and driving if having any social life". Afterwards the figure fell to 30%. The advertising messages had helped change the norm. The shift in attitudes seemed contagious. Drink driving was not just a crime - it had become socially unacceptable, and it was unacceptability rather than criminality that was the major reason why people did less of it. Let us now return to the submission that's been sent to the Justice Select Committee. It comes from the security company It's Mine Technology, and claims to take an evidence-based approach to crime prevention - combining "effective technologies with behavioural science". The company doesn't mince its words. "There is little empirical evidence that anything the Ministry of Justice has ever done since its inception in 2007 has had any impact on the commission of crime." The submission goes on to claim "the police have no idea what effective role they have had in reducing crime, no idea, based on evidence, about what works and little or no evidence to back any initiatives". "Ignorance of, and lack of respect for evidence and the scientific method bedevils the whole area of crime policy," the authors assert. The document makes the point that much of the thinking underpinning crime policy development is based on "expected utility theory" - broadly the idea that potential criminals make rational decisions on whether to commit a crime based on risk and reward. The evidence from behavioural economics, it is argued, suggests the opposite. Decisions on whether to commit a crime are usually irrational and bear little relationship to any risk v reward calculation. In fact, thieves overwhelmingly do not even know the potential punishment for their crime. The key to reducing crime, the submission suggests, is nudging - encouraging people to behave in pro-social ways without conscious thought. When it comes to the black market in stolen goods, might it be possible to make such trades as disgusting as drink driving? The submission document believes we should try. "Behavioural change can be contagious," it argues. "There is good evidence that everything from smoking to obesity, happiness, loneliness, co-operation and generosity can be 'caught'." So if buying a dodgy laptop or some smuggled cigarettes were to be regarded as socially beyond the pale, then the black market would crumble. Rather than thinking they'd happily stumbled across a bargain, drinkers in the snug would recoil. The authors of the submission suggest, as a first step, the default position should be that anyone found in possession of stolen goods be prosecuted under the Theft Act. One could imagine a hard-hitting advertising campaign, running alongside the tough legal stance, pointing out the distress that lies behind every item of loot offered in the pub. Perhaps the strapline might be: Nudge, nudge, say "no more". </body>

      <body>Broadcasting watchdog Ofcom is to take no action against Downton Abbey over its contentious rape storyline, despite receiving 244 complaints from viewers. The regulator said it had decided not to pursue the complaints "after careful assessment... because they did not raise issues warranting investigation." Some viewers complained to ITV about the storyline, which saw housemaid Anna attacked and raped by a guest's valet. The broadcaster received 200 complaints after the show was aired on 6 October. A warning alerting viewers to the upsetting scenes was broadcast before the episode, which was seen by an audience of almost 12 million. An Ofcom spokesperson said the warning had been into account, as well as the fact that the controversial scene was broadcast after the 9pm watershed. The fact that the attack itself took place off-screen also played a part in the regulator's decision. Downton Abbey creator Julian Fellowes has defended the storyline and its treatment, insisting it was neither gratuitous nor sensationalist. "Downton deals in subjecting a couple of characters per series to a very difficult situation and you get the emotions that come out of these traumas," he told the BBC. Joanne Froggatt, who plays Anna May Bates, has also defended the plotline, saying she was "proud" the show could tackle such a weighty subject. The fourth series of Downton Abbey reaches its conclusion on Sunday. </body>

      <title>Coulson 'never involved in hacking'</title>
      <description>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones", his barrister tells an Old Bailey jury.</description>

      <body>Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson "was never party to any agreement to hack phones - whatever others might have been doing on his watch", an Old Bailey jury has heard. His barrister Timothy Langdale QC was speaking after the conclusion of the prosecution opening statement. He said Mr Coulson wished he had made some "different decisions" but "he did not commit these offences". Mr Coulson, 45, of Charing, Kent, denies conspiracy to hack phones. Mr Coulson, who also denies conspiracy to commit misconduct, left the newspaper industry in 2007 and went on to become Prime Minister David Cameron's communications director. He is among eight defendants, who all deny the range of charges against them. Making opening remarks, which he said was a "relatively uncommon" for a defence barrister, Mr Langdale said his client would be taking to the witness box later in the trial to give evidence about "the fast-moving world of Sunday tabloid journalism - a fiercely competitive world". He said Mr Coulson's job was "not to know about every story during the week", adding there were "many thousands of pieces of information, many of which never got in the paper at all". Reporters kept sources close to their chest, often protecting them from rivals on their own newspaper, Mr Langdale added. And he told the court that private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who has a conviction for phone hacking for the News of the World and has admitted other phone-hacking charges, had targeted the phone of Mr Coulson. Mr Langdale said the case had "an unusual history" and "the trial itself will be unusually long". He also warned about "unfair reporting" of events, saying the Guardian newspaper had been wrong to say in July 2011 that News of the World journalists had deleted messages on the phone of murdered Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler, who went missing in 2002. There was no evidence to suggest Mr Mulcaire or any other person acting for the paper had deleted any message "deliberately or accidentally", he said. There was nothing the paper had done which gave rise to any "false hope" that Milly Dowler was still alive, he added. Later the court heard from the first witness, Det Sgt Gregory Smith, who investigated the phone hacking allegations. Jurors heard about a message from a recruitment firm left on the teenager's phone, a detail which became the subject of a News of the World story about her. Of the prosecution handling of the evidence, Mr Langdale said: "Their interpretation is wrong, their conclusions are wrong - there will be a time to reflect all that." Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC earlier told the court that notebooks went missing amid the "media firestorm" caused by the revelation that News of the World journalists had hacked Milly Dowler's phone. Those claims led to the closure of the paper in July 2011. Mr Edis said News International executive Rebekah Brooks and others hid evidence as police investigated the newspaper. He said security staff picked up a laptop and other material from Mrs Brooks's home in Oxfordshire, which was later found hidden in a bin bag near bins at her Chelsea Harbour flat. The court heard that, after it was hidden, a member of the security team sent a text to former security chief Mark Hanna that said: "Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Pizza delivered and the chicken is in the pot." Mrs Brooks, who was editor of the News of the World between 2000 and 2003, and her PA Cheryl Carter deny perverting the course of justice. Mrs Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, denies a second similar charge, along with her husband Charlie Brooks and Mr Hanna. She also denies conspiracy to intercept communications and conspiracy to commit misconduct. The trial continues. </body>

      <body>Marcia Wallace, the late actress who provided the voice of schoolteacher Edna Krabappel in The Simpsons, has been remembered in its latest episode. Sunday's edition of the series began with Bart Simpson at the blackboard, standing beneath the poignant message: "We'll really miss you Mrs. K." Wallace died of complications from pneumonia on 25 October at her home in Los Angeles at the age of 70. The actress won an Emmy in 1992 for her work on the long-running animated show. Sunday's edition of The Simpsons was preceded on the Fox channel in the US by a re-run of 2011 episode The Ned-liest Catch. Wallace appeared in 178 episodes in all, voicing grumpy fourth-grade teacher Edna in all but three of them. The actress's death was confirmed on 26 October by The Simpsons' executive producer Al Jean, who said she had been "brilliant and gracious". "She was beloved by all at The Simpsons and we intend to retire her irreplaceable character," he said in a message on Facebook. </body>

      <body>Irene Kane, the female lead in Stanley Kubrick's 1955 film Killer's Kiss, has died in New York of pancreatic cancer. Kane, who later co-authored celebrity autobiographies under her married name Chris Chase, played a dancer who falls for a boxer in Kubrick's crime drama. The actress would later say it was "a silly movie" that had been made "with no money [and] no names". Kane, who died on 31 October, went on to appear on Broadway and on television before moving into journalism. According to the Hollywood Reporter, her family declined to confirm her age at the time of her death. The former model was married in 1962 to television producer Michael Chase, the son of Pulitzer-winning playwright Mary. She went on to co-author the autobiographies of actress Rosalind Russell, comedian Alan King and one-time First Lady Betty Ford. Kubrick, whose later films would include Dr Strangelove, 2001: a Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange and The Shining, died in 1999. </body>

      <body>The first ever YouTube awards have been held in New York, with actor Jason Schwartzman and musician Reggie Watts presiding over a frenetic ceremony. As YouTube is a video-sharing site, the event featured Eminem, Lady Gaga and M.I.A making live music videos directed by the awards' creator, Spike Jonze, and others. Eminem won Artist of the Year, while Taylor Swift's I Knew You Were Trouble took the YouTube Phenomenon award. The ceremony was streamed live online. Nominees were chosen by taking into account the YouTube views, likes, comments and subscription figures for different artists. Indie actress Greta Gerwig kicked off proceedings at the sprawling Pier 36 venue, performing in a live video for Arcade Fire and their new song Afterlife. Lady Gaga was up next, tears rolling down her cheeks as she performed her single Dope for the first time wearing a baseball cap and flannel shirt. The coveted Video of the Year award went to South Korean group Girls' Generation for their song I Got A Boy, while Innovation of the Year went to DeStorm Power, the YouTube user whose 250 videos on the website have been watched more than 200 million times. The inaugural YouTube awards reflect an increasing trend for people to turn to the internet, rather than television and radio, for music and video. In August last year, the Nielsen rating agency published a survey in which 64% of American adolescents said they listened to music on YouTube, compared with 56% who listened to radio. </body>

      <description>Film director Martin Scorsese and artist David Hockney are honoured at a star-studded event in Los Angeles.</description>

      <body>Film director Martin Scorsese and artist David Hockney have been honoured at a star-studded event at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Lacma). The pair were honourees at the museum's annual Art+Film Gala, designed to bring the two industries closer together. Scorsese was praised for helping to save the museum's film programme from being cut and for his work on film restoration. Hockney was recognised for the way he captured the city through his artwork. "I first arrived in Los Angeles, almost 50 years ago in January 1964, and they were just putting up this building," the 76-year-old, who lived in California for nearly three decades, said in a brief speech. "It's the only encyclopaedic museum in Southern California and deserves your support." The artist's Seven Yorkshire Landscape Videos exhibition - created by mounting cameras to a car while he drove through the countryside - is currently on show at Lacma. The gala raised $4.1m (£2.6m) for Lacma's film programme, which was first introduced in 1965, but was hit by the financial crisis in 2009 and was forced to stop its weekend screenings. At the time, Scorsese was a vocal critic of the move and wrote an open letter to museum director Michael Govan saying he was "deeply disturbed" at the decision. "Marty was very vocal when we announced that we were pausing our film programme a few years ago during the economic meltdown," Mr Govan said at the gala. "When he learned that we really wanted to rebuild and expand our programme, he was the first person who offered to help." Scorsese has been an advocate for film preservation and founded The Film Foundation in 1990 to help the cause. The Goodfellas director also presented the restoration of four films by French film-maker Agnes Varda at the gala and appealed for help in preserving film from the ravages of time. "What is cinema? For me there is only one answer. Cinema is necessary. Please don't forget it," he said. Stars at the event, hosted by Leonardo DiCaprio, included Tom Hanks, Drew Barrymore, James Franco and Warren Beatty, while Sting provided the night's entertainment. </body>

      <title>Ender's Game tops US box office</title>
      <description>Sci-fi adventure Ender's Game debuts at the top of the US box office chart.</description>

      <body>Sci-fi adventure Ender's Game has zoomed to the top of the US box office chart in its debut weekend. Jackass Presents: Bad Grandpa, about an 86-year-old and his eight-year-old grandson, was shunted into second after hitting the number one spot last week. Ender's Game, a story about children forced to fight an enemy race, took $28m (£17.5m) according to estimates. The film stars Harrison Ford as a commander who manipulates a young boy (Asa Butterfield) into leading a war. Double Oscar nominee Viola Davis plays Ford's second in command. Based on the best-selling 1985 novel of the same name, Ender's Game was in line with box office forecasts which predicted it would take between $25m (£15.6m) and $30m (£18.8m) in its opening weekend. This was despite calls by some to boycott the film after the book's author, Orson Scott Card, made some comments expressing his opposition to gay marriage. But with the highly anticipated Thor: The Dark World opening next week, box office analyst Jeff Bock said: "It looks like Ender's Game is one-and-done... (next weekend) there won't be much of the box office pie left for Ender's Game." Last Vegas, featuring an all-star cast including Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline, opened in third place with $16.5m (£10.3m). Rentrak's Paul Dergarabedian said: "It's interesting to see the number of stars that are not in their 20s in the top films. "Ender's Game has Harrison Ford and Viola Davis, and Last Vegas is like a Hangover for the older crowd. Sandra Bullock and George Clooney - in Gravity - appeal to an older audience, and 12 Years a Slave... is a very sophisticated drama." Children's animation Free Birds, which features the voices of Owen Wilson, Woody Harrelson and Amy Poehler, debuted in fourth spot with takings of $16.2m (£10.1m). Gravity, now in its fifth week, rounded out the top five. Thor: The Dark World, which opened in the UK last Wednesday, beat all contenders at the UK and Ireland box office this weekend, earning £8.65m in its first five days in cinemas. Even without previews it was the comfortable victor, taking £5.54m between Friday and Sunday according to Screen International. According to its distributor Walt Disney, its weekend takings exceeded the entire first week box office of the first Thor in April 2011. Last week's top film, animated sequel Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2, fell to second place with a second weekend tally of £2.1m. </body>

      <body>Rihanna has joined The Beatles and Elvis Presley as one of just three acts to top the UK singles chart seven times over seven years. The singer has stormed into the number one spot, as the featured artist on rap star Eminem's new track The Monster. The pair held off a challenge from boyband One Direction, who were tipped to have their fourth number one with Story Of My Life. The Monster is Eminem's first number one hit since 2006. A previous collaboration with Rihanna, Love the Way You Lie, made it to number two in the UK charts in 2010. The track is taken from his latest album Marshall Mathers LP 2, which also features this month's top 10 hits Berzerk and Rap God. It will be released on 5 November. New Zealand singer Lorde, whose track Royals debuted at number one last week, fell one place to number two. Fat Boy Slim's Eat Sleep Rave Repeat entered the chart at number three, giving the DJ his first top 10 hit in 12 years. Former number one Counting Stars, by OneRepublic, rounds off the top five. In the albums chart, Arcade Fire's fourth album Reflektor knocked Katy Perry's Prism off the top spot, outselling the US singer by nearly two to one over the past week, according to the Official Charts Company. James Blunt's Moon Landing is at three, while Lorde's album Pure Heroine debuts at four. James Blake enjoyed the fruits of his Mercury Prize success, with his album Overgrown soaring up the charts to number 23, having been previously outside the top 200. There was also a re-entry into the top 40 for Lou Reed's album Transformer following the singer's death last weekend. </body>

      <body>One of the jailed members of the Pussy Riot protest band has vanished from sight since she was moved to a new prison 10 days ago, reports from Russia say. The husband of Nadezhda Tolokonnikova told a US news website he had not received any news about her and her current location was being kept secret. She had been on hunger strike at a penal colony in Mordovia. She and another band member were jailed over a protest in a Moscow cathedral. They were sentenced to two years' imprisonment after performing a crude protest song in February 2012. A third band member was released on appeal. Tolokonnikova has complained of abuses by the prison staff in Mordovia. Her husband said he last knew her precise whereabouts on 21 October, when guards put her on a train en route to a different prison. She was seen on 24 October by a fellow passenger as the train arrived in the city of Chelyabinsk, in the Ural mountains. Her husband, Pyotr Verzilov, told the Buzzfeed website he believed the decision to move his wife came from the authorities in Moscow: "They want to cut her off from the outside world." He said Ms Tolokonnikova was still weak after two hunger strikes, and accused the authorities of trying to punish her because of her protests. Pussy Riot's act was regarded as blasphemous by many Russians, but their prosecution caused an international outcry. Mordovia, some 445km (275 miles) east of Moscow, has labour camps dating back to the notorious Gulag system set up by Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. </body>

      <body>BBC broadcaster Paul Gambaccini has been arrested on suspicion of historical sexual offences as part of Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree. Mr Gambaccini, 64, was held at his home in south London early on Tuesday and questioned in police custody, before being released on bail until January. A spokesman for Mr Gambaccini said he denied the allegations. The BBC said Mr Gambaccini would not be presenting his Saturday Radio 2 show for the "coming weeks". "Paul Gambaccini has decided that, in light of today's media attention, he would rather not be on-air at present and we respect that decision," a corporation spokesman said. "Therefore, Paul will not be presenting on BBC Radio in coming weeks and replacement programmes for the period will be announced soon." New York-born Mr Gambaccini, who has a string of TV and radio shows and books to his name, presents music hits and classics from the US on his show. He was due to present a 30-minute documentary for Radio 4 about the music world's reaction to the assassination of President John F Kennedy, to coincide with the 50th anniversary of his death. Mr Gambaccini's spokesman said: "Mr Gambaccini was interviewed by Operation Yewtree officers about historic allegations. He answered their questions and was co-operative. He denied all allegations." Mr Gambaccini is the 15th person to be held under Operation Yewtree, launched in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal. A 16th person, aged 74, who has not been named, was also arrested at a separate address in south London on Tuesday, and bailed until January. Operation Yewtree has been investigating historical sexual offences since claims of abuse were made against former BBC radio DJ and television presenter Savile, following his death at the age of 84 in 2011. Mr Gambaccini was arrested under the strand of the inquiry known as "others", meaning the arrest is not connected to the investigation into Savile. The other two strands of Yewtree concern the actions of Savile, and allegations against "Savile and others". </body>

      <body>French writer Gerard de Villiers, whose thrillers sold more than 100m copies around the world, has died aged 83. De Villiers died after a long illness, his lawyer said. He had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May. He was the creator of the popular SAS series, with an Austrian hero often seen as France's literary James Bond. Drawing on his network of intelligence sources around the world, De Villiers was famous for his uncanny knack of anticipating actual events. "The last weeks he was conscious but very weak," de Villiers' wife, Christine, told the AFP news agency. "It is exactly the death that he did not want," she added. De Villiers's SAS series became a publishing phenomenon in France, Germany, Russia, Turkey and Japan, the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris reports. The series starred a fiercely anti-Communist Austrian aristocrat called Malko Linge, who worked as a freelance CIA agent. The SAS initials came from Linge's honorific Son Altesse Serenissime (His Most Serene Highness). De Villiers was inspired by Ian Fleming's James Bond but felt that no-one would believe in a French spy hero - so instead created Malko Linge, our correspondent says. With covers invariably featuring a semi-naked woman with a gun they have been a staple of railway station book shops, selling by the million. Starting in 1965, de Villiers churned books out at a rate of four a year. His last and 200th book - SAS: The Kremlin's Revenge - was released last month. "I never had any pretensions of being a literary writer," the writer admitted in an interview with the AFP last year. "I consider myself a storyteller who writes to amuse people." </body>

      <body>Robert Lindsay is to make his musical theatre comeback next year in a West End version of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels. The Spys and My Family actor will play an urbane con-man plying his trade on the French Riviera - a role played in the 1988 film by Sir Michael Caine. Rufus Hound will play his younger rival in the musical, which begins previews at London's Savoy theatre next March. Lindsay, 63, was last seen in a musical playing Fagin in Oliver!, a performance that won him an Olivier award in 1997. "I have been waiting for the right musical to cross my path and feel like I have finally found it," the former Citizen Smith star said. Hound will play Freddy Benson, the character Steve Martin played in the Frank Oz comedy, opposite Lindsay's Lawrence Jameson. The 1988 film was itself based on a 1964 release called Bedtime Story, which starred David Niven and Marlon Brando in the leading roles. Lindsay and Hound will be joined on stage by Katherine Kingsley, who plays the millionaire soap heiress who comes between their characters. Dirty Rotten Scoundrels will be directed and produced by Jerry Mitchell, winner of multiple Tonys for musicals including La Cage aux Folles, Legally Blonde and Kinky Boots. Known for his appearances in TV shows Celebrity Juice and Let's Dance for Sport Relief, Hound was recently seen in One Man, Two Guvnors in the West End and on tour. The 34-year-old promised his new show would be "faithful enough for fans of the movie" and "anchored in good, old-fashioned comedy". </body>

      <body>A painting described as the definitive portrait of Jane Austen is to be sold at auction in December. The watercolour, which has rarely been seen in public, has remained in the Austen family since it was created. Estimated to fetch up to £200,000, it was commissioned by the author's nephew, Rev James Edward Austen-Leigh, in 1869 to accompany his biography of the author. An engraving of the painting will appear on the new £10 note from 2017. The portrait was based on the only confirmed portrait of Austen made during her lifetime by her sister Cassandra. Austen-Leigh did not think his aunt's depiction was a true likeness however, so commissioned Maidenhead artist James Andrews to create a more "satisfying version" based on his own memories. In his biography, titled Memoir of Jane Austen, he described her as "a clear brunette with a rich colour". "She had full round cheeks, with mouth and nose small and well formed, bright hazel eyes, and brown hair forming natural curls close round her face...she never was seen, either morning or evening, without a cap." Dr Gabriel Heaton from auction house Sotheby's said Andrews' portrait - which became the accepted image of Austen and spawned many reproductions - was "part of our cultural history". "This is the most important likeness of Jane Austen ever likely to appear on the open market," he said. "The painting was commissioned for the first full-length biography... which was crucial in transforming her from a novelist into a national figure. "The portrait gave readers an image with which they could identify and which even seemed to embody the character of her work." The painting will be sold at a Sotheby's London auction on 10 December. </body>

      <body>Luc Besson has attacked paparazzi in Taiwan for disrupting the shooting of his latest film by taking photographs of leading lady Scarlett Johansson. At a press conference in Taipei, the French film-maker said shooting had been "a nightmare" due to constant press intrusion. "I lost a bit of my concentration," admitted the Fifth Element director. Besson spent 11 days in Taipei filming Lucy, in which Johansson plays a drug mule endowed with superhuman abilities. It had been reported Besson's crew were nearly involved in a car accident last weekend with a vehicle driven by local press. The alleged incident led the city's mayor to call on the media to exercise restraint. Besson also singled out two unnamed agencies from Hong Kong for special condemnation. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Besson said it was his right to keep such details as Johansson's hair style and wardrobe out of the public eye until his film was released. "We don't want pictures with new dresses of Scarlett," he said while denying reports he had wanted to leave Taiwan early in protest. Photos taken of the 28-year-old actress on set have shown her sporting a blonde bob, a leopard print jacket and a cowboy hat. No release date has been set for the movie, which will see Johansson appear alongside US veteran Morgan Freeman and South Korean star Choi Min-sik. Besson's crime comedy The Family, starring Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, is released in the UK on 22 November. </body>

      <body>The producers of the James Bond films are to receive the David O Selznick Achievement Award from the Producers Guild of America (PGA). Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said they were "honoured to be associated" with Gone with the Wind producer Selznick. The award recognises their body of work in film and past recipients include Steven Spielberg and Clint Eastwood. The prize will be presented at a ceremony in Los Angeles in January. The PGA Awards co-chairs Lori McCreary and Michael De Luca called Wilson and Broccoli "the driving force behind one of the most cherished franchises in the history of film. "Thanks to the consistency and steadfastness of their creative vision, generations of moviegoers have been able to share the adventures of one of our iconic heroes. "We look forward to their continuing to bring thrilling exploits and cinematic masterpieces to audiences worldwide, and we are delighted to honour them with this year's David O Selznick Achievement Award." The Bond franchise celebrated its 50th anniversary last year with its 23rd film, Skyfall, which went on to become the biggest ever 007 movie, taking over $1bn at the box office. Wilson began working on the Bond series in 1979 and produced many of the most famous Bond films including For Your Eyes Only and Licence to Kill. In more recent years, he has co-produced the likes of GoldenEye, Casino Royale and Skyfall with Broccoli, his half-sister. The 24th Bond film, which is being directed by Sam Mendes with Daniel Craig reprising his role as the British spy, is due for release in 2015. The 2012 David O Selznick Achievement Award went to Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner of Working Title Films. </body>

      <body>British comic actor Graham Stark, best known for his recurring roles opposite Peter Sellers in the Pink Panther films, has died aged 91. The actor died in London on Tuesday after recently suffering a stroke. Roles in Alfie and James Bond spoof Casino Royale were among his more than 100 screen credits. It was his friendship with Sellers that secured his roles in the Pink Panther series, beginning with 1964 film A Shot in the Dark. He played Inspector Clouseau's stone-faced assistant, Hercule Lajoy, a role he reprised in 1982's Trail of the Pink Panther. The part saw him say little more than "Oui, monsieur" to Clouseau's orders. He later starred as Dr Auguste Balls in Revenge of the Pink Panther (1978) and Son of the Pink Panther (1993). He memorably also appeared in 1976's The Pink Panther Strikes Again, playing a German hotel clerk in a scene where Clouseau is bitten by a dog. "I thought you said your dog did not bite?" says Clouseau, to which Stark replies: "That is not my dog." Stark, who was born in Wallasey, Merseyside, made his professional debut at the Lyceum theatre in London in a pantomime aged 13. After studying at Rada he volunteered for the RAF. During the war years he entertained the troops around the world with fellow airmen and future stars Sellers, Tony Hancock and Dick Emery. He went on to star in numerous comedy TV shows, including The Idiot Weekly, A Show Called Fred and Benny Hill, before landing his own BBC sketch series, The Graham Stark Show, in 1964. Other films in which he appeared include Victor Victoria, Superman III and Blind Date. He also directed two films: the 1970 short Simon Simon and the 1971 comedy The Magnificent Seven Deadly Sins. Stark was a keen photographer and had exhibited his work - mainly images of his acting colleagues and friends - around the world. His autobiography, Stark Naked, was published in 2003. He is survived by his wife, the actress Audrey Nicholson, and three children. </body>

      <body>Jack Alexander of the enduring musical act The Alexander brothers has died. A statement from Ayrshire Hospice said the 77 year old died peacefully at 13:40 with his family around him. Jack and his 79-year-old brother Tom started their professional career at Webster Theatre in Arbroath in 1958. The pair, from Cambusnethan in North Lanarkshire, toured all over the world during a career spanning more than 50 years and were awarded MBEs for services to entertainment. The family have asked for privacy at this time. The brothers were both classically trained and played from a young age, with Jack on the piano and Tom on the accordion. They developed their Scottish style after comedian Roland Smith suggested they follow the style of popular acts like Andy Stewart and the Joe Gordon Folk Four. Robbie Shepherd, BBC Radio Scotland presenter of Take the Floor, said: "It is so sad to hear that Jack has died. As a pair they were the tops in Scottish variety theatre." </body>

      <body>Sir Mick Jagger has issued a statement denying Katy Perry's claims that he made a pass at her when she was 18. Perry made the comments during an interview on Australian radio this week, while promoting new album Prism. She said the incident took place when she sang backing vocals for Sir Mick's 2004 song Old Habits Die Hard. But a statement from the 70-year-old Rolling Stones frontman said he "categorically denies that he has ever made a pass at Katy Perry". It continued: "Perhaps she is confusing him with someone else.'' Perry, 29, told her interviewer, "I actually went to dinner with him one time and he hit on me one time when I was like 18. "But that was a long time ago and since then he's been very kind and I got to sing Beast Of Burden on his stage on their tour," she added. She was one of several singers to make a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones' tour earlier this year. When Perry was asked during the interview how she turned down an advance from a star such as Mick Jagger, she responded: "Well, you bring a friend and they do them. You sacrifice your friend." </body>

      <body>Filming has begun on the third series of Rev, the BBC Two sitcom about the mishaps of an inner-city vicar. Tom Hollander returns as Reverend Adam Smallbone, who will be seen facing up to the pressures of parenthood with his wife Alex (Olivia Colman). Actor and director Dexter Fletcher and Fonejacker star Kayvan Novak will join the cast as an award-winning modern artist and local Imam respectively. Six new episodes of Rev will be made for broadcast next spring. Simon McBurney and Miles Jupp are among other regulars who will be back for the new series. So will Downton Abbey star Hugh Bonneville, reprising his role as Adam's arch rival Roland Wise. Created by Hollander and James Wood, Rev was crowned best situation comedy at the 2011 Baftas. Series two was screened in 2012 but producers had to delay filming another series because of the blossoming careers of its stars Hollander and Coleman. It was confirmed last year that an American version of the show, to be set in a deprived neighbourhood of Chicago, was in development. </body>

Mohr-Pietsch has fronted the breakfast show for the past seven years. She will move on to host the station's Sunday programme, The Choir, and its Monday lunchtime concerts. "It's been a pleasure to be the voice that Radio 3's listeners wake up to," Mohr-Pietsch said. "But after all those early mornings, I've decided I'm finally ready for a lie-in and a new challenge!" Mohr-Pietsch will host her last show on 15 November and begin her Monday slot from 2 December. She will begin on The Choir on 5 January. Burton-Hill, who has been a weekend presenter on Radio 3 for the past two years, said it was a "tremendous honour" to join the breakfast show.

Burton-Hill has previously fronted BBC Young Musician and the BBC Proms, as well as appearing on BBC Two's Culture Show and BBC Four's The Review Show. A trained violinist, she studied at the Royal College of Music and recently toured with conductor Daniel Barenboim as an honorary member of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra.

      <title>Doctor Who 'better than real life'</title>
      <description>Tom Baker: 'Being the Doctor was so much better than real life'</description>

      <body>As Doctor Who nears its 50th anniversary, Tom Baker reflects on his seven years as the fourth Doctor. "It was so much better than real life," he says. Tom Baker is planning to break the habit of a lifetime on 23 November. The actor says he's never been interested in watching Doctor Who - including his own stories - but he plans to sit down in front of this month's special episode that will mark the show's 50th anniversary. "I hope it's going to be terrific," he says. "It's such a landmark. It'll be a big, emotional thing, but I don't know what they'll do - I'll make an exception and watch that." With his long scarf and love of jelly babies, Baker's fourth Doctor remains one of the most instantly recognisable incarnations of the Time Lord. He is also the show's longest-serving star, having played the role from 1974 to 1981. "I can't explain the show's longevity any more than I can explain my own," booms the 79-year-old actor when we meet in a private members' club in London's Covent Garden. "It's just a happy accident." Baker admits he "wasn't at all happy" just before he was cast to replace Jon Pertwee in what is arguably British TV's most well-known role. After joining Olivier's National Theatre company in the late 1960s, Baker moved into films. He was Rasputin in Nicholas and Alexandra (1971) and had roles in Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Canterbury Tales (1972) and The Golden Voyage of Sinbad (1973). But he was working as a labourer when he was cast in Doctor Who. "I was going through a bad time of feeling rejected, even though I'd had a flirtation with movies. I was on a building site, having no skill there except to make the tea and use a drill," Baker recalls. "So when the opportunity came to play Doctor Who, it was a jackpot." Baker's co-workers on the building site found out the news by reading it in the Evening Standard. "I went to work next morning - famous! They were so thrilled for me. I legged it down to Barclays Bank and got an advance and gave them a party. It was like being reborn." Baker admits he had no idea how he was going to tackle his role as the new star of Doctor Who. "How could I? I didn't watch it. I didn't watch it when I was in it and I haven't watched it since. So when it came, and these scripts were given to me, one of the problems was they were being written for Jon Pertwee - so I had to wrench it my way." Without doubt, Baker made the part his own. Viewing figures went up and many of his stories - The Ark in Space, Genesis of the Daleks, The Brain of Morbius, The Deadly Assassin and The Robots of Death - are regarded as classics. How did he find being the Doctor? Baker beams. "It was a great experience. Actors want a big audience, and to be admired and to get applause is one thing, but to be adored is something I recommend." He reminisces about visiting schools and hospitals, doing charity work and being flown round in helicopters. "Everywhere I went I was waving like royalty and dishing out 50 pence pieces," he says. "It was so much better than real life. I stayed so long because real life at the time wasn't so terrific. "Being Doctor Who, I used to look at the clock and know at half past four we were going to stop rehearsing - and that was a sad moment for me because I wanted to stay in this beautiful, unreal world." Asked if he has kept any Doctor Who props, Baker responds: "I had lots of bits and pieces but they've all been begged off me by the charities. It's all gone now." "I have some interesting letters from fans who saw me as a messianic figure and thought I could do miracles." He flashes one of his Doctor-like grins: "They were quite mistaken, but I didn't disabuse them." 'In the groove' After leaving Doctor Who in 1981, Baker's career embraced TV, stage and film. In 1982 he was Sherlock Holmes in BBC TV's The Hound of the Baskervilles, and his stage roles included Hedda Gabler, Educating Rita (RSC) and She Stoops to Conquer (NT). More recent TV roles include Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased), Monarch of the Glen (2004-5) and the narrator of Little Britain. Despite his assertion that he's not watched his own stories, Baker has, of course, sat through some of them for DVD commentaries and at conventions. In recent years he has reprised the role of the Doctor for a number of Big Finish audio adventures. "I'm back now in the groove," Baker says. "The fans want to go back in time and I don't disappoint them because I haven't advanced at all from Doctor Who." All these years on, the actor notes, Doctor Who fans can still be in awe of him. "Anyone who's on television gets a reaction when playing a heroic part like the Doctor. And it still happens now with much older people. "But some of them are telling me lies," he adds, with a glint in his eye. "I met an old lady, aged about 85, the other day, who said: 'When I was a little girl I used to hide behind the sofa when I saw you!'" Many of those who watched the show in the 60s and 70s have helped bring on the next generation of fans. "People introduce me to their grandchildren or to their children," Baker says. "It's very sweet that it's passed on affectionately by parents, showing my old stuff. "Small children sometimes approach me and ask 'is it true you used to be Doctor Who?'" The Doctor Who 50th anniversary special, The Day of the Doctor, will be shown on BBC One on 23 November. </body>

      <title>Press views: Weisz and Craig in Betrayal</title>
      <description>Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig in Harold Pinter's Betrayal</description>

      <body>Married actors Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig and fellow British star Rafe Spall were applauded by a star-studded audience at the opening night of their performance in the Broadway revival of Harold Pinter's play, Betrayal. Steven Spielberg and Bruce Springsteen were among those watching and tickets for the new adaptation are reportedly changing hands for thousands of dollars on the black market. Pinter's 1978 play was inspired by the playwright's extramarital affair with BBC television presenter Joan Bakewell. Craig plays the cuckolded Robert, while Weisz is Emma, the wife who betrays him with his best friend (Spall). The play is directed by Mike Nichols. The compact, rugged Craig hasn't shrunken from years behind the camera: he projects himself fully and muscularly to the back stalls. Craig even enlivened vastly inferior material when last he was on the Great White Way, in the 2009 police melodrama A Steady Rain. And he's not emoting in a vacuum: Weisz and Spall have charisma to spare, not to mention keen sexual chemistry for their Kilburn flat trysts. So the design is lovely, the cast is appealing and the play itself, while of its time, is not essentially dated. It's simply that nobody gets the tone. Read the full review here Although this production never catches its breath to reveal the slow-burning ashes of the past that the play usually makes vivid, knockout performances from both Craig and Weisz render it a Betrayal on fire. Nichols's crude and chaotic depiction of the love triangle is powerfully compelling theatre - enhanced, one feels, by the real-life frisson supplied by the onstage sparring of Weisz and Craig. Read the full review here Anyone who shelled out the big bucks to see James Bond in the flesh will get more than they bargained for in Mike Nichols' impeccable revival of Betrayal. They'll be getting a powerful performance from Daniel Craig, a movie star who still has his stage legs. Rachel Weisz, Craig's wife in the real world, and Rafe Spall, both superb, claim much of the stage time as the adulterous lovers in this enigmatic 1978 play that Harold Pinter based on one of his own extramarital affairs. But it's the smouldering Craig, as the cuckolded husband, whose brooding presence is overpowering. Read the full review here Craig, who occupies the most explosive point on the play's libidinous triangle, easily comes off the best, playing Robert, the publisher whose wife, Emma (Weisz), is revealed to have had a seven-year affair with his great friend, Jerry (Spall), who was best man at the couple's wedding - a rather cartoonish best man on this evidence, given that Spall plays the gathering ache of the text largely for laughs. (There's also a hint that these Oxbridge contemporaries, plied with enough drink, might well become more than simply friends.) Across nine scenes and as many years, Pinter rewinds events to conclude with the telling physical act that launched the affair, a small yet impulsive gesture here replaced by the sight of Jerry and Emma all but devouring one another: overstatement where less would be more, and sexier, too. Read the full review here Craig, last seen on Broadway opposite Hugh Jackman in 2009's A Steady Rain, showed his dynamic stage chops even in a mediocre play. With a jewel like this one, he's magnificent... watching Craig and Weisz - an offstage husband and wife - explore the unique capacity of a married couple for mutual cruelty adds another fascinating layer. In her Broadway debut, Weisz makes her character's pain incandescent. Her Emma is an unhappy beauty who can be emotionally transparent one minute, brittle and unreadable the next. The actress brings a deliberate stilted, somewhat tremulous quality to the performance that is perfect for Pinter; her line readings suggest Emma's awareness that any ill-chosen word might detonate a bomb. Like her male co-stars, Weisz leaves her character's motivations open to interpretation, which makes this production of Betrayal keep playing out in your head days after seeing it. Read the full review here This is a sexed-up Betrayal, which is not the same as a sexy Betrayal. All those contradictory, fleeting, haunting shades of thought that you expect to see playing on the features of Pinter's characters are nowhere in evidence. Instead, Robert, Emma and Jerry make up the rowdiest, most extroverted sexual triangle since Liza Minnelli, Burt Reynolds and Gene Hackman caterwauled their way through the ill-fated film Lucky Lady in 1975. And I can safely say that this production has the highest decibel level of any version I have encountered. I suppose you could conceivably argue, generously, that with volume comes clarification. Certainly, the abiding Neanderthal aspects of manhood - a subtext in Pinter's power plays - have seldom been more violently rendered than they are in Mr Craig's shouted fulminations, Mr Spall's flustered stammerings or even in Ms Weisz's good-ole-gal heartiness. But it does make it hard to believe that these people could ever possibly deceive one another, when their faces keep reading like large-print telegrams. Read the full review here One of the play's best scenes, set in an Italian restaurant in which Robert takes out his frustration on Jerry by blowing up at the waiter (Stephen DeRosa), strongly implies that Robert is more heartbroken over Jerry than Emma. Craig exposes the sadness beneath Robert's displaced anger while Spall throws into relief Jerry's self-protective bewilderment. Nichols takes risks with his interpretation but maintains the necessary ambiguity of the situation. His production would have been stronger, however, if he had allowed Weisz's Emma to play hardball with the boys. Kristin Scott Thomas would have given Craig and Spall a real match. But this Betrayal is a decidedly male affair, and Craig and Spall live up to the expectations that have surrounded this most anticipated production of the New York fall season. Whether the work justifies such exorbitant ticket prices is another story. Read the full review here Too often, this Betrayal seems to make the same statement as its marketing campaign. We're reminded that we are watching great thea-tuh, staged by a prestigious company, rather than being titillated or moved by the longing and anguish and bile that courses through the play's triangle. Weisz's Emma can be earthy to the point of seeming blowsy, giggling and wiping her nose between sips of booze. Yet somehow the performance seems studied - that of an elegant actress showing us a cultured but tempestuous woman with her guard down. She has one wonderful, crushing scene with Craig, when Robert essentially shames his wife into a confession; cowering and crying out, Weisz conveys despair, rather than just projecting it. Craig is crisp and robust throughout, deftly illustrating Robert's capacity for menace, and he and Spall have some witty fun with the festering rivalry between the two buddies. But at length, their exchanges - while absorbing enough for those who enjoy watching educated Brits struggle with their feelings - never really draw blood. Read the full review here Director Mike Nichols keeps the mood sombre and the pace deliberate, leaving plenty of room for those famous Pinter pauses. In truth, the mystery and menace are relatively muted for Pinter, and there's a certain safeness in hiring Nichols, Broadway's most bankable director, to direct a couple of movie stars in what is probably the playwright's most conventional and crowd-pleasing drama. Yet Craig and Weisz are excellent, Spall even better, and it's a sleek, taut and spellbinding evening. Read the full review here Director Mike Nichols' handsome, well-staged production is not your typical crowd-pleaser. Those seeking a more traditional star turn might want to scan the orchestra section before the curtain goes up. (The night I attended, the audience included Javier Bardem, Bette Midler, Glenn Close, and Oprah Winfrey.) Perhaps because Pinter's backwards structure forces him to seed each scene with clues to his puzzle-like plot, there's an off-putting guardedness to the main trio. They regard their emotions from a safe distance, as if with hands safely tucked into pockets. Unable to engage with each other, they may prove a challenge for audiences to embrace as well.

      <title>Romanian film enters a new era</title>
      <description>Why Romanian film is entering a new era</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24668173</url>

      <body>Child's Pose - The Golden Bear-winning Romanian drama is released in UK cinemas this weekend. While it was the winner at the Berlin film festival Alison Frank found a wealth of Romanian films were riding high at the recent Warsaw film festival. Is this the start of a new era for Romanian film? The Romanian New Wave was declared several years ago, as The Death of Mr Lazarescu (2005) and 4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days (2007) triumphed at international film festivals, opening doors to subsequent Romanian films such as California Dreamin' and Tales from the Golden Age. All waves eventually break, but those who sounded the end of Romania's may have spoken too soon. At the recent Warsaw Film Festival Romania tied with Poland for the largest number of films in competition with four, coming just behind the Czech Republic. While none of the five Czech films won any awards, Romania secured one prize and a statement of appreciation. Romania's dominance in Warsaw was more than a matter of quantity. Romanian debuts such as Love Building and Little Spartan demonstrated originality where other first-time directors offered a pale imitation of cinema's masters. Against a background of films filled with cruel individuals and empty violence, the Romanian directors' better-developed characters, playful sense of humour and thought-through conclusions were refreshing. The Romanian films had their share of death, illness, loneliness and betrayal, but offered closure as they typically found a witty, sometimes absurd way to deal with life's imperfections, compromises and disappointments. Romanian comedy Love Building got a standing ovation at its first Warsaw festival screening but also received special praise from the critics' jury. First-time feature director Iulia Rugina has been surprised at the broad appeal of her low-budget comedy, which had a successful Romanian box office run before making its international premiere in Warsaw. "Love Building was very well received in Romania by the audience. That was important because it is rare. There is a very big group of population who refuses to go watch Romanian films and makes a statement about this," Rugina explains. As to critical favour, Rugina says: "I know it is not often that audience-friendly films are critically acclaimed. And the other way round. That is why to have both is unexpected." Love Building is the story of three relationship therapists who set up a week-long couples' retreat in the countryside. Yet most of the comedy comes from the therapists' own, much bigger, relationship issues. If there's one problem with Love Building, it's that there are too many characters: it's hard for audiences to keep track of some 14 couples, and even harder for an 85-minute film to give all of them sufficient screen time. But the film's very existence depends on its crowded cast list. Every year, professional actors Dragos Bucur, Alexandru Papdopol and Dorian Boguta (who play the film's therapists) run a summer acting school, which normally ends with the making of a short film. Last year, Iulia Rugina suggested that they try to make a full-length film instead. Where filmmakers normally decide on the script first and select their cast second, here the process was reversed. Faced with a large group of mainly non-professional actors, Rugina had to come up with a story set in countryside with enough roles for all the students. One of the most common questions from audiences is why there are two lesbian couples in the film, but no gay couples: it's because more women than men took part in the acting school that year, Rugina explains. The most successful Romanian film in Warsaw was The Japanese Dog, directed by Tudor Cristian Jurgiu. It won the 1-2 Competition for directors making their first or second feature. The film revolves around an elderly man who lost his wife, home, and most of his belongings in a flood, and is estranged from his only son who moved abroad years ago. Unexpectedly, his son comes to visit with his Japanese wife and seven-year-old son. Grandfather and grandson immediately bond over photo albums and a toy - the robotic Japanese dog of the film's title. There is little dramatic tension, and the dog feels like a bit of a gimmick, but the film nonetheless offers a beautiful and sensitive portrait of the Romanian countryside, of cross-cultural and cross-generational bonding, and directs attention towards the increasingly common and devastating problem of flooding. While The Japanese Dog was to some degree typical festival fare, Little Spartan was a film that many critics were at a loss to describe. Sure enough, it is a bizarre hybrid of a film in every respect. Billed as a mockumentary, Little Spartan is the result of a collaboration between first-time feature director Dragos Iuga and Gabriel Dita, an engineer who suffers from a lack of growth hormone receptor in the pituitary gland. Making use of interviews, mobile phone footage, surveillance cameras, home videos and even fantasy, Iuga shot the film over the course of 17 years, exploring various aspects of the life of Dita, nicknamed Little Spartan. Endlessly surprising and full of eclectic elements, the film might be dismissed as just another pseudo-documentary, albeit an odd one, if it weren't for the vein of the fantastic snaking through the film. This is a daring addition and sure enough, the fantasy element in Little Spartan knocks it off balance, yet such is its whimsy and magic, it is hard not to be charmed. In his uncle's workshop, Dita and his brother as children look on while the carpenter makes whimsical wooden lamps that mysteriously power themselves. While it did not win any awards, Little Spartan was aptly placed in the festival's Free Spirit category for its uninhibited and experimental approach. The Romanian New Wave in its early days was marked by social realism and a clear-eyed approach to both its Communist past and its neo-liberal future. According to this definition, The Japanese Dog fits most clearly into the New Wave lineage, while Love Building corresponds partially as a satire of the new aspirational middle classes. But could the more eclectic approach of Little Spartan and the popularity of Love Building's comedy mark a new stage in the evolution of Romanian cinema? Iulia Rugina thinks so. "The Romanian New Wave is still high up, but I am not able to predict what will happen next...there might be an alternative type of films coming out - a lighter type of cinema, more glossy, more audience-friendly, a little distant from the Romanian realism that international festivals have got used to." International audiences came to know Romania's cinema through stark realism; the coming years may be marked by a more popular, but no less fresh and innovative Romanian New Wave, embraced both at home and abroad. UK audiences will get a chance to experience a selection of these films at the 10th Romanian Film Festival in London that starts 28 November. The festival is entitled Turning the Page, indicating how the films on show look forward beyond the New Wave in terms of content, social analysis and storytelling. "The windows have been thrown open! We're turning the page!" is the festival's tagline. </body>

      <title>Judi Dench's 'huge responsibility'</title>
      <description>Judi Dench: 'I feel a huge responsibility'</description>

      <body>Dame Judi Dench's latest role in Philomena, about a woman who tries to find a son she was forced to give up for adoption, is already being tipped for Oscar recognition. Judi Dench is no stranger to winning acclaim for playing real-life characters. She was Queen Victoria in Mrs Brown (1997) and a year later won an Oscar as Queen Elizabeth I in Shakespeare in Love. In Iris in 2001, she won a Bafta for her portrayal of celebrated English author Iris Murdoch in her battle with Alzheimer's disease. Earlier this year, in John Logan's new play Peter and Alice, she played Alice Liddell Hargreaves - the real-life inspiration for Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland. Dame Judi's latest film role sees her as Philomena - an Irish Catholic woman who is still alive - whose astonishing story was first told in former BBC foreign correspondent Martin Sixsmith's book The Lost Child of Philomena Lee. "I feel a huge responsibility because people know her and therefore they will look at the film and want to recognise Philomena in me," explains Dame Judi. "And I hope they do," she adds. "A friend said I can't see a vestige of you in the film and I said 'you couldn't have paid me a bigger compliment'. I like nothing better than to be told that." In the film, directed by Stephen Frears, Philomena's story begins when she becomes pregnant as a teenager in 1952, and - regarded as "a fallen woman" - is sent to a convent in Roscrea, County Tipperary. In the care of the nuns, Philomena works in the laundry and is allowed to see her young son, Anthony, for an hour a day. But aged three, Anthony is taken away for adoption against Philomena's will. Having spent the next 50 years trying to track down her son, Philomena meets Sixsmith, a former director of communications for Tony Blair's Labour government as well as an ex-BBC correspondent, who realises that she has a remarkable story worth further investigation. Sixsmith is played on screen by Steve Coogan, who co-wrote the film's screenplay with Jeff Pope. Dame Judi recalls how Coogan came to read her the script in her garden. "I've always liked the idea of someone coming and telling you the story. The moment it was over I wanted to do it straight away," she said. What was it about Philomena's story that appealed to her? "It's about strength, faith, fortitude and the fact that Philomena wears her tragedy very lightly and she seems quite vulnerable - and yet she has the strength of 20 people inside her." Unlike some of her recent roles, Dame Judi had the opportunity to spend time with the real Philomena in order to develop the character. The actress was struck by both Philomena's vulnerability and her sense of humour. "She just made me laugh. She's very vulnerable, but having read the story you know her strength is phenomenal and her faith is unbreakable." Both those elements of her character are explored in the film. Dench and Coogan share several laugh-out-loud scenes, while Coogan's Sixsmith is the only one of the pair who expresses anger at the way Philomena has been treated by the church. Dame Judi herself refuses to be drawn on how audiences might respond to Philomena. "It isn't my business to think what the outcome of it will be. My business is to be truthful to her story and her. What it evokes in people, I don't know yet." She attributes her ability to capture Philomena's character and accent to her own Irish roots. She could imagine her mother, who was from Dublin, saying a lot of Philomena's lines. "Had it been Danish or Dutch or German or French or Russian there is a whole lot more that I would have to have done in preparing for the film, but I did understand the Irishness of it, which actually sounds rather rude, I don't mean that. I understand that nature, because that was very much in my mother." As awards season approaches, Dame Judi is being widely tipped as a front-runner for best actress at the Academy Awards alongside Cate Blanchett (Blue Jasmine), Sandra Bullock (Gravity), Meryl Streep (August: Osage County) and Emma Thompson (Saving Mr Banks). It would be her seventh Oscar nomination. And according to Empire magazine, Philomena is "the British film to beat come Bafta time". Despite all the injustices suffered by Philomena, to this day she retains her religious faith. Would Dame Judi have been so forgiving? "No," she replies without hesitation. "I doubt if I know many people who would have been as forgiving as she is. I have a quite strong faith. I would love to think I could have been like that, but I completely doubt it." Philomena, made by BBC Films, is out in the UK on 1 November. </body>

      <title>Coastal retreat plan to curb floods</title>
      <description>The UK's largest ever coastal flood realignment sees a part of the West Sussex coast given back to the sea to increase protection.</description>

      <body>A scheme to combat flooding by surrendering land to the sea will be completed on Monday on the south coast. The £28m "managed realignment" at Medmerry in West Sussex has seen the building of 7km (four miles) of new sea walls up to 2km inland. By letting the waters in, the Environment Agency says the risk of flooding for hundreds of homes will be reduced. The surrendered land will become a wetland habitat for many species. The sea has long been a threatening presence on the flat land of the Manhood Peninsula that juts into the English channel on the coast between Portsmouth and Worthing. Caravan parks in Selsey and Bracklesham Bay have been flooded a number of times in recent years, as the shingle defences have yielded to the surging seas. Since 2011, the Environment Agency have been working on a plan that they believe curbs that threat. The project is billed as the country's largest ever coastal flood realignment scheme, but it has required the destruction of the existing sea wall at Medmerry and giving back to the sea some of the land nearest to the coast. "We have made a hole in the sea wall," the Environment Agency's flood and coastal risk manager, Andrew Gilham, told BBC News on a visit to the site. "But before doing that we've actually built 7km of new defences further inland from the coast. What we've been able to create here is an area that can absorb the energy of the waves and reduce the flood risk to people." Although the new walls are much closer to local communities, the Agency says homes are much better protected as a result, with the development able to withstand a once in a thousand year flood. The change is partly being forced on the Agency because of EU legislation that requires compensation for the loss of wildlife habitat through development. The Medmerry scheme makes up for the loss of similar conservation areas in and around the Solent. "It is not politically driven," said Mr Gilham. "But the benefit of creating the habitat here is not only to reduce flood risk in this area but also to reduce flood risk to communities in Portsmouth and Southampton. "If we weren't able create habitat here we wouldn't be be able to do those defences." The scale of the £28m development is enormous. Between the new earthen walls and the sea stand 183 hectares of land that the Agency says will rapidly become a saltwater marsh, with potentially huge benefits for wildlife in the area. It will be managed by the RSPB. "Even in construction, we're seeing lots of migratory birds using this area," said Andrew Gilham. "It is already starting to be used by the wildlife. It's a massive nature reserve and a massive opportunity on the south coast." Local people are hoping that letting the sea in will not only protect their homes but boost the local economy as well. Alan Chamberlain is the estate manager of the newly renamed Medmerry Park holiday village. His business, located next door to the new habitat, is actually below sea level. "In the past we have been very close to flooding, and now we've got a one-in-one-thousand-year protection, one of the best in the country actually," he told BBC News. "For us it's a win win, it will encourage visitors to the site, birdwatchers and those interested in nature." The new development is facing its first big test on the day it opens as it will see one of the highest tides of the year. But the Environment Agency are fully confident it will pass with flying colours. Medmerry is one of a number of managed realignment projects that the Environment Agency are involved in. Andrew Gilham says it's part of a new approach. "Rather than fighting it, we are working with nature," he explained. "It's an important change in approach, you can only keep building bigger and bigger defences for so long. We have to ask if we can make better use of public money. "Certainly the habitat we are creating here is important to the broader ecosystem and the broader economy of the country by encouraging people to visit remote areas." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <body>A rare solar eclipse allowing a view of the Sun that is totally or partially blocked by the Moon has taken place. It was first visible in the southern United States, before sweeping east across the Atlantic Ocean and the African continent. The US space agency, Nasa, said the greatest total eclipse occurred over the Atlantic Ocean. One of the best views was in northern Kenya, where tour companies organised trips to view a total blackout. Local myths there attribute the event to the Moon eating the Sun. Partial views were available in eastern North America and southern Europe. This solar eclipse was a rare occurrence in that it was "hybrid" - switching between an annular and total eclipse. In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the sun, while an annular eclipse occurs when the Moon is at its farthest from the Earth and does not block out the Sun completely, leaving a halo of sunlight still visible around the Moon. The eclipse event began about 1,000km (620 miles) east of Jacksonville, Florida with an annular eclipse visible for four seconds at sunrise. As the Moon's shadow raced east the eclipse switched from annular to total along a narrow corridor. The greatest total eclipse occurred in the Atlantic Ocean, approximately 330km south-west of Liberia, and lasted for more than one minute. The eclipse continued across Africa through the Congos until it passed through northern Uganda and northern Kenya, ending in southern Ethiopia and Somalia. Either side, a partial eclipse was seen within a much broader path including eastern North America, northern South America, southern Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Experts warned that no-one should attempt to view the Sun with the naked eye. A safe view of eclipses can be obtained by using special welder's glasses or a pinhole camera. </body>

      <title>Trees help at-risk species keep cool</title>
      <description>Dense tree canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study shows.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-24761801</url>

      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70833000/jpg/_70833091_3935853244_026eb85aea_z.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>Forests with dense canopies create a microclimate that protects a variety of cold-adapted plant species from warming air temperatures, a study has shown. Researchers found plants that favoured cooler conditions fared better under dense canopies than in ones that were more open to the elements. They added that these conditions could be a "critical mechanism" in the conservation of forest plant diversity. The findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. A team of international researchers, headed by scientists from Belgium, noted that previous studies had shown that "biological signals of recent global warming" had been increasing across an array of ecosystems. "Around the globe, climate warming is increasing the dominance of warm-adapted species - a process described as 'thermophilisation'," they observed. The team gathered data from vegetation survey from more than 1,400 plots in temperate forests across North America and Europe. In each plot, they compared the results from an original survey with a repeated survey that was, on average, carried out 34.5 years later. The results showed that there had been a sizeable turnover, with about one-third of the species present in the original survey being replaced by other plants. Shaded sanctuary However, they also found that the thermophilisation of vegetation was lowest in forests where canopies had become denser. "These results suggest that recent forest canopy closure in northern hemisphere temperate forests has buffered the impacts of macroclimate warming on ground-layer plant communities, thus slowing changes in community composition," they wrote. As well as lowering temperatures, the dense canopy cover also increased relative air humidity and shade within forests' understorey. The researchers explained that these conditions also offered protection to forest herbs and tree seedlings from summer drought, "decreasing mortality and thus buffering the impacts of large-scale climate change". They noted that in western Europe, a number of factors - such as changes to management regimes - had resulted in increased tree growth and forest densities. "Logging and natural losses of tree biomass have been consistently lower than annual growth increments, resulting in an almost doubling of standing stocks of trees per hectare between 1950 and 2000," they wrote. Temperate forests account for about 16% of the world's tree cover, while understorey plants account for 80% of the flora diversity found in these habitats. Co-author Keith Kirby, a woodland ecologist from the University of Oxford's Department of Plant Sciences, said the microclimate created by a dense forest canopy allowed some plants to remain within their comfort zone. However, he warned: "The other thing we must remember is that this moderating characteristic only works as long as you have got the canopy there. "At some stage, the trees themselves may die from disease, they may get felled or they themselves might succumb to the effects of climate change. "Once that happens, what we might then see is that the ground flora might start to shift quite rapidly, so we might have things keeping relatively stable for quite a while but then we pass a tipping point once the canopy opens up." After a prolonged post-war hiatus, traditional woodland management techniques - such as coppicing - are becoming popular once again. But Dr Kirby told BBC News that this study's findings suggested that a more considered approach might be needed. He observed: "This might be a case to say hold on a minute because if we start coppicing and opening up the canopies, we will also be exposing these plants to future climate change more. "Maybe in the future we should be reducing the extent that we break up canopies." But he added that perhaps "the gentle intervention" of management techniques was needed in order to strengthen woodlands' resilience to the threats posed by pests, pathogens and extreme weather events. </body>

      <body>People are being asked to offer their views on how the English countryside should look. The government has opened a consultation on the priorities for spending nearly £20bn of EU subsidies over the next seven years. The budget has been cut overall and there is huge controversy about how it should be shared between helping farmers and protecting wildlife. The decisions will have an impact on hedgerows, trees, wild flowers, birds, bees, water quality and the appearance of the landscape. An EU settlement in the summer has given individual nations more discretion on how to spend funds. Some countries want to prioritise direct help for farmers, but the UK government says farmers should have to earn their cash as much as possible by working in a way that benefits the environment. Ministers want to divert the maximum amount of 15% into rural development and green schemes. They aim to help hill farmers and to create shelter for pollinators, such as bees and moths. But this has worried big farmers, who they say they will lose out and get less direct payment than some of their European counterparts. The National Farmers' Union (NFU) president, Peter Kendall, said: "English farmers are already significantly disadvantaged in comparison with their near neighbours in the EU." Environmentalists are not happy either. They argue the government's plans have failed to ensure that whole landscapes are farmed in a way that safeguards water quality and the environment. Helen Perkins from the Wildlife Trusts said: "We need to see farming for nature mainstreamed - with environmental standards raised on every farm so that exemplary practices aren't restricted to pockets of the countryside." Campaigners are perplexed that the government has given the public just 28 days to respond to the consultation on an immensely complex reform. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own processes over farm budgets. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin </body>

      <title>'Low health risk' from fracking</title>
      <description>The risks to public health from fracking for shale gas are low, according to a new official report.</description>

      <body>The risks to public health from fracking for shale gas are low, according to a new official report. Any problems publicised so far - such as in the US - are the result of operational failure or poor regulation. The study, by Public Health England, an agency of the Department of Health, reviewed the latest research. It focused on the risks of emissions of the chemicals used in fracking and radioactive material released with the gas. The central conclusion is that "potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction are low if the operations are properly run and regulated". The report recommends environmental monitoring through the lifetime of any project and public disclosure of chemicals used in the fracking fluid. The findings have been welcomed by the government which is pressing for the development of shale gas in the UK. Environmental campaigners opposed to fracking say the study highlights the risks and the lack of oversight. So far exploratory fracking has been limited to one site in Lancashire but the British Geological Survey (BGS) estimates UK shale could yield 150 billion cubic metres of gas, so commercial interest is growing. The report draws on American research to conclude that though pollutants can enter the air from gas flaring or leaks, "these emissions are relatively small, intermittent and certainly not unique to shale gas extraction…" One quoted study - from the Barnett Shale in Texas in 2010 - found 70 individual volatile organic compounds including ethane, propane, butane and pentanes close to shale gas activity but observed these to be "localised" and significantly diminished downwind. But the authors recognise that there is relatively little evidence to go on - the only detailed peer reviewed study of the impact of air emissions was published last year by the Colorado School of Public Health. That work found that people living within half-a-mile of gas wells had an elevated risk of health conditions including neurological and respiratory effects. However the Colorado study was criticised for having a small sample size and the Public Health England report says local weather and topography may mean that similar results may not be likely in Britain. The PHE report acknowledges that extracting shale gas could produce residues containing naturally-occurring radioactive materials - but it argues that these risks would be similar to those in the existing oil and gas industry. On the dangers of groundwater being contaminated, the study quotes a 2011 paper by MIT researchers who found that nearly half of 43 pollution incidents were related to drilling operations - mainly because of faulty sealing of wells. According to the PHE study, American experience points to surface spills of chemicals being the most likely to affect water sources. However it points out that 99% of drinking water in England comes from heavily-regulated water companies so the risk is "considered minimal". The remainder who get their water from private wells are "particularly vulnerable" - but "high quality well integrity" should protect water sources. Another risk examined is from the chemicals used in the fracking process. An American study found 75% of them could affect skin, eyes and breathing while 25% are carcinogenic. For that reason, the PHE study calls for full disclosure of the chemicals used and strict enforcement of chemicals handling and of well design. Overall, the study concludes that the well-publicised problems experienced in the US may not be replicated in the UK because of differences in geology, operation and regulation. The energy minister Michael Fallon welcomed the findings. "The UK has the most robust regulatory regime in the world for shale gas and companies will only be granted permission to frack for shale if their operations are safe," he said. However Greenpeace campaigner Leila Deen said the report was a "timely reminder" of the risks of fracking and the potential long-term health impacts. "The government has so far responded to these risks by cutting the budget of the environmental regulator and effectively allowing companies to mark their own homework when it comes to monitoring." </body>

      <title>Elephant cull effects 'last decades'</title>
      <description>African elephant society remains disrupted by culling operations that took place decades ago, research reveals.</description>

      <body>African elephants' decision-making abilities are left impaired by culling operations that ended decades ago, University of Sussex research suggests. A study found that elephant herds that lost adults to culls during the 1970s and 1980s were less able to respond appropriately to other elephant calls. Lead researcher Prof Karen McComb said the animals' "social understanding" had been impaired by the loss of adults. The results are published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology. The scientists, from the University of Sussex, say this is the first "systematic evidence that fundamental social skills may be significantly impaired by man-made disruption". To study this, the researchers compared the behaviour of two herds of elephants: those in the Amboseli National Park, in Kenya, which have been relatively undisturbed by culling operations and a population in Pilanesberg National Park, South Africa. The herd at Pilanesberg was made up of young orphaned elephants introduced during the early 1980s and 1990s, after management culls of adult and older juvenile animals in the Kruger National Park. There is already evidence that the loss of these adult elephants had dramatic social consequences on South Africa's elephants; the researchers describe these effects as akin to post traumatic stress disorder. In two protected areas in South Africa, Prof McComb told BBC News, "young, orphaned male elephants became hyper-aggressive and attacked and killed rhinoceroses". Dr Graeme Shannon, who led this study, used sound to test the animals' social understanding - playing recordings of other elephants calls to monitor their response. When Amboseli elephants heard the call of an unfamiliar elephant, they reacted in a defensive way - bunching together and moving towards the sound. This, Prof McComb explained is an appropriate response. "It's what elephants should do when faced with a genuine stranger," she said. Equally appropriately, Amboseli elephants "remain relaxed when faced with the calls of more familiar animals". In Pilanesberg, by contrast, the elephants' reactions were "completely random". "There was no pattern at all to their responses," Prof McComb told BBC News, suggesting that these elephants could not tell the difference between friend and foe. "This really suggests that the breakdown in their social fabric, even though it occurred decades ago, has had a real effect on their decision-making processes," she added. "Their social understanding has been impaired." Their second playback experiment reinforced this conclusion, revealing that the Pilanesberg elephants did not distinguish between the call of a mature, dominant elephant and that of a much less threatening youngster. African elephants can live for up to 70 years and form close-knit groups that are dominated by a matriarch. So the researchers say that the loss of experienced adults can have long-term negative consequences on a herd. This, they add, is "the first direct evidence" that these important social abilities in elephants are "severely compromised" in animals that had been separated from family members decades before. Richard Byrne, professor of evolutionary psychology at the University of St Andrews, said this was a "very important piece of work". He told BBC News: "By probing directly into the social knowledge of elephants years after translocations shows that the long-term unfortunate effects have indeed not been underestimated. "I hope the results will be taken into account in any further plans to cull locally 'unwanted' elephants." </body>

      <title>Down's pregnancy blood test trialled</title>
      <description>A blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS.</description>

      <body>A simple blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS. It could significantly reduce the number of women needing invasive testing, which can cause miscarriage. The study at Great Ormond Street Hospital will assess how and when the blood test could be introduced across the NHS. In the UK, 750 babies are born with Down's syndrome each year. All pregnant women in the UK are offered screening for Down's syndrome. Currently a woman's risk is assessed, based on her age, an ultrasound scan and markers in the blood. Those deemed at high risk of a child with Down's are offered an invasive test. It involves using a needle to take a sample of either placental cells or of the fluid that bathes the baby - but this procedure carries a one-in-100 chance of miscarriage. The aim is to reduce the number of women having the invasive testing by more accurately assessing the risk. The new blood test, which is already available privately, looks for tiny fragments of DNA from the placenta and the foetus floating in the mother's bloodstream. Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of a massive stretch of DNA - a part or even all of chromosome 21. The test can analyse the free floating DNA for extra copies. It is thought to be 99% accurate. Those with a positive result will still be offered the invasive procedure to confirm the result. Prof Lyn Chitty, from Great Ormond Street who is leading the trial, told the BBC: "It could very significantly reduce the number of invasive tests and increase detection, this is seriously exciting stuff and it would be great to get it into the NHS. "What we are trying to do is give information on how and when to introduce it into the NHS." The NHS National Institute for Health Research funded trial will analyse the scale of the benefit and the best way to inform mothers and train staff, including midwives, about the test. "One of the very important aspects of our study is looking at ways to ensure women understand the test and the implications of the results so that they can choose whether or not to have it," she said. Dr Anne Mackie, from the UK National Screening Committee, said: "Early indications suggest that using Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) to screen women who are found to be at a higher risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome would enable earlier and safer detection of the condition. "[We have] been working in close collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, particularly in looking to ensure the new test does not affect the quality of the current service offered to pregnant women." Carol Boys, the chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association said: "We would be delighted if tests which lead to miscarriage were discontinued. "We understand that the new test is approximately 99% accurate for those women who have already been established as having a high chance of carrying a baby with Down's syndrome, and are interested to see if that accuracy is maintained in women where this has not already been established. The studies for this are still under way." She said the information and education provided to women and health professionals would be important. </body>

      <title>Falling trend in CO2 emissions</title>
      <description>New research suggests that the rate of global emissions of CO2 may be slowing down, despite economic growth.</description>

      <body>Global emissions of carbon dioxide may be showing the first signs of a "permanent slowdown" in the rate of increase. According to a new report, emissions in 2012 increased at less than half the average over the past decade. Key factors included the shift to shale gas for energy in the US while China increased its use of hydropower by 23%. However the use of cheap coal continues to be an issue, with UK consumption up by almost a quarter. The report on trends in global emissions has been produced annually by the Netherlands Environment Assessment Agency and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre. It finds that emissions of carbon dioxide reached a new record in 2012 of 34.5bn tonnes. But the rate of increase in CO2 was 1.4%, despite the global economy growing by 3.5%. This decoupling of emissions from economic growth is said to be down to the use of less fossil fuels, more renewable energy and increased energy savings. The main emitters, accounting for 55% of the global total, were China, the US and the European Union. All three saw changes that were described as "remarkable" by the report's authors. Emissions from China increased by 3% but this was a significant slowdown compared to annual increases of around 10% over the past decade. There were two important factors in reducing China's CO2. The first was the ending of a large economic stimulus package. As a result electricity and energy prices increased at half the rate of GDP. "They want to grow economically less fast," one of the authors, Dr Greet Maenhout, told BBC News. "It is like a tiger that you have to keep under control, and you can also see in the CO2 trends, the growth is not so big." China also achieved exceptional growth in the use of hydropower for the generation of electricity, increasing capacity and output by 23% in 2012. This alone had the effect of curbing the country's emissions by 1.5%. In the US, the shale revolution continues to make waves. Overall emissions were down by 4% in the year mainly because of a continuing shift from coal to gas in the generation of electricity. Shale is now responsible for one third of US gas production and almost one quarter of total oil production. "It is amazing, shale gas has been growing since 2007/8, I think it will continue but that is speculation," said Dr Maenhout. "I think there is an economic benefit to further expansion, I am not expecting it to go down." The other major decline came in the European Union where economic recession in the 27 nation bloc saw emissions decline by 1.3%. This was down to a decrease in energy consumption of oil and gas, with a 4% decline in road transport. Renewable energy also continued its upward trend, at accelerating speed. It took 15 years for the renewable global share to increase 0.5% to 1.1% - but it took only six years for it to double again, to 2.4% in 2012. Looking ahead, the report suggests that if the push for shale continues in the US, if China sticks to its published plans and if renewables continue to grow - particularly in Europe - global emissions might slow down permanently. "It is good news but still not sufficient," said Dr Maenhout. "We are still having increases every year which are cumulative. Since CO2 lives for 100 years in the atmosphere, we will still not be able to cope with a 2C target for 2050." The report was welcomed by green activist Bill McKibben, who is campaigning for a divestment from fossil fuel stocks and shares. "It is good news but nowhere near good enough," he told BBC News. "The solution we need here is dictated by physics, and at the moment the physics is busy melting the Arctic and acidifying the ocean. "We can't just plateau or go up less, we have to very quickly try and get the planet off fossil fuels." Follow Matt on Twitter. </body>

      <title>Earth-sized 'lava world' discovered</title>
      <description>A scorching "lava world" with a similar mass and density to that of Earth has been discovered orbiting a star 400 light-years away.</description>

      <body>A doomed "lava world" with a similar mass and density to that of Earth has been discovered orbiting a star 400 light-years away. Observations suggest the planet, named Kepler 78b, is composed mostly of rock and iron, much like our own planet. But its extremely close proximity to its host star - a hundredth of the distance between the Earth and the Sun - remains something of a puzzle. Details of the work by two teams of researchers appear in Nature journal. From theory, astronomers expect the planet to be tidally locked to its host star, which means that one side is permanently facing in, and the other side permanently facing away. Temperatures on Kepler 78b's "dayside" - the side of the planet facing its star - are a searing 2,000C-2,800C, far too hot to support life. "I think it's safe to say that the surface on the 'dayside' is molten," Josh Winn, associate professor of physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), told BBC News. But he added: "Nobody has really calculated whether or not we expect the 'nightside' to be molten (we do not know the temperature of the nightside), nor how far down the molten layer is expected to go within the planet." The hot Earth-twin belongs to a new class of "ultrashort period" planets recently identified by the now-defunct Kepler space telescope. These newfound worlds all complete one circuit of their host star in less than 12 hours. But according to current theories of planet formation, Kepler 78b could not have formed so close to its star, nor could it have moved there. Dimitar Sasselov, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, an author on one of the Nature papers, said: "Kepler 78b is going to end up in the star very soon, astronomically speaking. "It couldn't have formed in place because you can't form a planet inside a star. It couldn't have formed further out and migrated inward, because it would have migrated all the way into the star. This planet is an enigma." Kepler 78b's orbit and size have been determined by analysing the light given off by the star as the planet transits, or passes in front as viewed from Earth. The researchers detected a transit each time the star's light dipped, and measured this dimming to determine the planet's size. This was possible because the bigger an exoplanet is, the more light it blocks. But measuring the planet's mass involved tracking the motion of the star itself. Depending on its mass, a planet can exert a gravitational tug on its star. This stellar motion can be detected as a very slight wobble, known as a Doppler shift. The results suggest Kepler 78b is about 1.2 times the size of Earth, and 1.7 times as massive. From the same measurements, the astronomers calculated the planet's density as 5.3 grams per cubic centimetre, close to the 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre value for Earth. These results provide strong evidence for Kepler 78b's rocky composition. Dr Winn said the fact that two independent teams of scientists came to similar conclusions about the alien world added confidence to the measurement. Kepler-78b is probably a doomed world, researchers explained. Gravitational tides are expected to draw it ever closer to its star. Eventually it will move so close that the star's gravity will rip the planet apart, vanishing within three billion years. Paul.Rincon-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk and follow me on Twitter </body>

      <body>The golden eagle has topped the vote in a campaign to find Scotland's favourite wild animal. The bird of prey was competing against the red deer, red squirrel, harbour seal and otter. The campaign was run jointly by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and VisitScotland as part of the Year of Natural Scotland 2013 celebrations. Thousands of votes were recorded online following the campaign launch in spring this year. Voting closed on Thursday. The golden eagle received 4,773 of the 12,417 votes cast. The red squirrel was second with 2,523, the red deer 1,819, otter 1,794 and harbour seal 725. Other animals received 783 votes, with the top three being wildcat, pine marten and puffin. Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: "While we can be enormously proud of all our native wildlife, it is fitting that the magnificent golden eagle has topped this poll of Scotland's Big 5 species. "At present Scotland is home to all of the UK's breeding pairs of golden eagles, and the species has done well to recover after almost being wiped out in the last two centuries. "However, recent incidents have shown that the golden eagle is still threatened by illegal persecution in some areas. We have a responsibility to protect this wonderful bird so that future generations can continue to enjoy its presence in our skies." Scotland's Big 5 were selected because they were all high profile species, widely associated with Scotland, and with a broad geographical spread. Ian Jardine, SNH chief executive, said: "The response to the campaign has been brilliant. Thousands of people have voted for their favourite from Scotland's Big 5 list. "There have been several alternative lists put forward for seabirds, game animals, trees and plants, and support for rarer species like the pine marten and wildcat. "It has got people thinking about and talking about wildlife, and showing how much affection and pride people have, not just for the five species on the list, but for Scottish wildlife generally." Through the partnership with SNH, VisitScotland promoted the campaign to millions of potential visitors. The campaign explained where best to see the animals in their natural environments. This saw all of Scotland's Big 5 championed through a series of billboard advertisements in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle, Glasgow and Edinburgh and extensive radio and online advertising. Mike Cantlay, chairman of VisitScotland, added: "We've been absolutely delighted with the response that Scotland's Big 5 campaign has received, and it has been a cornerstone of our celebrations for the Year of Natural Scotland 2013. "One of the key pillars of the year was to get as many people here at home out seeing parts of Scotland that they may not have been to before, and the Big 5 campaign has given us a fantastic opportunity to promote even the most remote areas of our wonderful country." </body>

      <body>A team of researchers says it has identified a new species of humpback dolphin. Physical and genetic evidence suggests that cetaceans found in waters off northern Australia are distinct within the humpback family. This general group grows up to 2.4m in length and inhabits coastal waters from the Atlantic to the Pacific. The evidence for the distinct species in northern Australia is outlined in the academic journal Molecular Ecology. "Based on the findings of our combined morphological and genetic analyses, we can suggest that the humpback dolphin genus includes at least four member species," said co-author Martin Mendez, from the Wildlife Conservation Society's Latin America and the Caribbean programme. Dr Mendez added: "This discovery helps our understanding of the evolutionary history of this group and informs conservation policies to help safeguard each of the species." The authors analysed physical data gathered mostly from beached dolphins and museum specimens. Specifically, the team examined features from 180 skulls covering most of the distribution area of the group in order to compare features across the region. The researchers also collected 235 tissue samples from humpback dolphins, stretching from the eastern Atlantic to the western Pacific Oceans, analysing both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA to study variation. Dr Nicholas Higgs, a marine biologist from Plymouth University, told BBC News: "It is an interesting and significant finding and has important conservation implications, namely that the Australian population is a distinct species and should be given conservation status on its own. He added: "We knew that there were humpback dolphins living off Australia, but didn't realise that they were a separate species from that living in the rest of South-East Asia."

      <body>A wild boar which has been on the loose in Alderney for more than a month is thought to have swum there from the nearby French coast. The boar found its way into a pig farm on Friday but, when approached, escaped by jumping over a 1m (3ft) stock fence. Farm owner Tess Woodnutt said she would not have believed the animal could jump so high from a standing start, if she had not seen it with her own eyes. Islanders have dubbed the boar "ghost pig", as it has only been seen at dusk. Mrs Woodnutt said she first became aware of the boar on 27 September, when she was on holiday and received a call from a fellow islander saying one of their 40 pigs had escaped. Her son Jake immediately went to the farm and soon established no pigs were missing. Steve Shaw, who was Alderney harbour master for 25 years, said he did not believe it would be possible for a wild boar to get to the island by boat without the crew noticing, and he had never heard of a wild boar being found on any vessel. Some islanders have speculated the animal could be an "iron age pig", which have been farmed on the island. However, Alan Woodnutt, Tess's husband, said he was certain it was not. "Iron age pigs are a cross between a wild boar and a Tamworth," he said. "They look a bit like a wild boar but this animal was not the progeny of an iron age pig." Mrs Woodnutt said the boar's arrival on the island was a mystery but she had had it confirmed to her by an expert in the UK that a wild boar could swim long distances in open water. Wild boar are commonly found in Normandy, the coast of which lies seven miles (11km) to the east of Alderney. Duty Insp Kieran McGrath from Guernsey Police said islanders should contact them if they spotted the animal and should not approach it themselves, as any wild boar could be dangerous when cornered. </body>

      <title>Scientists decipher dog-tail wags</title>
      <description>The way a dog moves it tail can shed light on its mood - and other dogs can spot and respond to these differences, a study suggests.</description>

      <body>Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood. Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish. But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences. The study is published in the journal Current Biology. Prof Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist from the University of Trento, said: "It is very well known in humans that the left and right side of the brain are differently involved in stimuli that invokes positive or negative emotions. "Here we attempted to look at it in other species." He added that just as in humans, for dogs the right side of the brain was responsible for left-handed movement and vice versa, and the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions. Dogs on film To find out more about how dogs react to the lop-sided tail wags of other dogs, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched films of other dogs. They measured the pets' heart rates and analysed their behaviour. Prof Vallortigara said: "We presented dogs with movies of dogs - either a naturalistic version or a silhouette to get rid of any other confounding issues, and we could doctor the movement of the tail and present the tail more to the left or right." When the animals saw an otherwise expressionless dog move its tail to the right (from the tail-wagging dog's point of view), they stayed perfectly relaxed. But when they spotted a tail veer predominantly to the left (again from the tail-swishing dog's point of view), their heart rates picked up and they looked anxious. Prof Vallortigara said he didn't think that the dogs were intentionally communicating with each other through these movements. Instead, he believes that they dogs have learned from experience what moves they should and shouldn't feel worried about. He said: "If you have several meetings with other dogs, and frequently their tail wagging one way is associated with a more friendly behaviour, and the right side is producing a less friendly behaviour, you respond on the basis of that experience." The researchers say the findings could give owners, vets and trainers a better insight into their animal's emotions. Dog behaviour expert John Bradshaw, a visiting fellow at the University of Bristol's school of veterinary science, said this was not the first study to examine whether left and right were important to canines. Last year a team from the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when looking at an aggressive dog and to the right when looking at a happy dog. And in another research paper from the University of Victoria in Canada, he said: "Dogs were more likely to approach a robot dog when its 'tail' was made to wag left rather than right, rather than becoming anxious - the opposite way around to the [Italian] study." He said the differences could be because the dogs in the different studies were not fully interpreting the animals in the films or robo-dogs as canines. A study of how dogs responded to real dogs could help, he explained. "While there is considerable evidence from many different mammals that the two sides of the brain are used for different purposes, much of the detail still has to be hammered out - and dogs are no exception," he said. "However, given the ease with which their behaviour can be recorded, it will probably not be long before we understand why their tails sometimes go one way, sometimes the other." </body>

      <title>Dark matter hunt nears final phase</title>
      <description>The first results from a particle detector called LUX suggest that the hunt for dark matter could be entering its final stages.</description>

      <body>Scientists could be nearing the final phase of the search for dark matter: the enigmatic substance thought to make up a quarter of our Universe. The first results from a particle detector called LUX show it is the most powerful experiment of its kind. It did not detect any dark matter during its first run, but scientists say it is poised to probe deeper than ever before during its second in 2014. It has also ruled out earlier hints of dark matter shown by other experiments. Dr Chamkaur Ghag, a collaborator on the LUX experiment from University College London, said: "If the dark matter is out there and if it interacts the way we think it does we should really start seeing it now." Not finding any direct evidence for dark matter particles would mean that physicists would have to "go back to the drawing board", he added. Missing matter Dark matter is thought to make up 27% of the Universe. But astronomers have only been able to infer its existence through the gravitational effects it has on visible matter in the Universe; no-one has ever directly detected it. Most scientists believe that it takes the form of particles called Weakly Interacting Massive Particles, or WIMPs, and that millions of these are streaming through us every second without a trace. There are three main ways that scientists are hunting for this elusive stuff. One is to look in deep space, using detectors such as the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), to search for the debris that dark matter particles leave behind as they collide with each other. Another method is with the Large Hadron Collider, where scientists are hoping to create dark matter as they smash particles together. And the third is using detectors, installed underground, to try and detect the particles as they pass through the Earth. These experiments are set up to spot the very rare occasions when dark matter particles bump into regular matter. The LUX (Large Underground Xenon) detector is located deep in a mine in the Sanford Underground Research Facility, US. Its first 90-day run took place earlier this year. "What we've done in these first three months of operation is look at how well the detector is performing, and we're extremely pleased with what we're seeing," said Prof Richard Gaitskell, from Brown University in Rhode Island. "This first run demonstrates a sensitivity that is better than any previous experiment looking to detect dark matter particles directly." During this period, the detector did not see any evidence of dark matter. The team said that this absence also ruled out the possibility that other detectors, such as DAMA in Italy and the CDMS and CoGeNT experiments in the US, had seen glimpses of dark matter. The researchers said because LUX was so sensitive, if these hints had been correct, then it would have seen dark matter particles too. However, the scientists are hopeful that in the next 300-day run, which is scheduled to start in early 2014, LUX could be the first experiment to directly detect dark matter. "This really really should be it. I personally hope we will have detected WIMPs within this decade," said Dr Ghag. "We should know what a quarter of the Universe really is and LUX should be the one that finds it first." Commenting on the LUX results, Prof Carlos Frenk from Durham University said: "In the last decade, there have been claims by different groups from around the world who say they have cracked the problem - and some of them have not been received by the community with overwhelming confidence. But in the last few years these claims have really come thick and fast from some very good groups - from some of the best experimentalists in the world. "What LUX has done is brought some more order into the chaotic world of claims and counter claims. So when they say they rule out previous claims - one has to take them very seriously. But no doubt, more debate will ensue." He said he was hopeful that LUX might find evidence of dark matter. "I won't get the champagne out right now. But I will buy some and put it in the fridge." Prof Anne Green from the University of Nottingham added: "LUX is a big step forward in the field of WIMP direct detection. It's really impressive that they've achieved world leading sensitivity with their first, short data taking run. "LUX is complementary to indirect detection and collider experiments, such as AMS and the LHC. Because we don't know the exact properties of the WIMP, we don't know which type of experiment will see it first. And to be 100% sure we've detected dark matter we'll want to see consistent signals in different experiments." If LUX fails to conclusively find dark matter, the team has another chance with an even larger and more sensitive experiment: LUX-ZEPLIN. But if this cannot see any signs of the elusive particles, then it could be that physicists have got the concept of dark matter wrong and will have to come up with some new theories. </body>

      <title>Doping effects can last a decade</title>
      <description>Research in mice indicates that using steroids can have muscle building benefits for far longer than previously believed.</description>

      <body>New research suggests that athletes who use steroids for a short period can benefit for their entire careers. Experiments with mice showed that a brief exposure to testosterone allowed the mice to rapidly regain muscle later in their lives. The scientist behind the study says that if a similar effect can be shown in humans, it should lead to a lifetime ban for dopers. The research has been published in the Journal of Physiology. Norwegian scientists had previously published work that showed the existence of a "muscle memory". This suggested that if people exercised when they were young, their muscles grew more easily when they exercised later in life. The same team has now looked at the impact of a brief exposure to testosterone on mice. They found that three months after the drug was withdrawn, their muscles grew by 30% after six days of exercise. A control group of mice saw growth of just 6% in the same time period. "It is rare to have data that clear cut, I was pretty satisfied with that," Prof Kristian Gundersen, from the University of Oslo, told BBC News. He explained that the drugs boost the number of cell nuclei in the muscle fibres. These nuclei are key to building strength in muscles when people exercise and the mouse study suggests that these extra nuclei gained through using testosterone remain in the long term. Prof Gundersen believes the same holds true for humans. Despite the long held belief that steroid users lose the benefit of the drugs when they stop taking them, the Norwegian research suggests that even a brief exposure to steroids could have a long-lasting effect. "If it is sufficient to build muscle mass, I think it would be sufficient to give you this long term effect. I think it could last 10 years but I don't have the data to back that up. It would be my speculation yes," he said. The Norwegians believe that their research calls into question the current proposal from the World Anti Doping Agency (Wada) to raise the penalty for dopers from two years to four. "In science if you cheat, you are out for life, and my personal view is that it should be similar for athletes," he said. "It is a harsh treatment but if you really are cheating, I think that's reasonable." The team has been given a grant from Wada to carry out further research on humans. They are developing the protocols for a study involving students at a sports college in Oslo. The research follows on from work that was carried out in Sweden in the past few years. Researchers found that power lifters who have stopped taking steroids had an advantage in their sport years after they stopped using the drugs. The researchers discovered that the lifters who had once taken the drugs had a comparable number of cell nuclei in their quadriceps as athletes who were currently performing high intensity training.

      <title>Insect-like drone is 'crash happy'</title>
      <description>Flying robot Gimball has been designed to bounce off objects to cope with chaotic environments after a disaster</description>

      <body>An insect-like flying rescue robot that can bounce off trees and buildings has been revealed by its creators. Gimball has been developed to be used in situations that are hazardous to humans. The robot is designed to be able to deal with crashes, and to right itself after a collision. Gimball has a protective spherical roll-cage, and is mounted on pivots to stay upright. The flying robot, which bounces off walls, moves in a similar way to a mosquito. Gimball was in part inspired by the way insects fly, co-creator Adrien Briod told the BBC. "Usually robots need to move around obstacles, so we thought it would be interesting to allow it to sustain collisions," Mr Briod said. The drone, described as "crash happy", was designed and built by a team in Switzerland at the Ecole Polytechnique Federerale de Lausanne (EPFL). The robot was developed for use in disaster situations, such as entering a building on fire, or after a radiation leak. Normally flying robots are taken out of action by a major collision, but the designers did not think the problem could be solved by adding more sensors. To keep Gimball lightweight, the research team decided to allow the robot to ricochet off obstacles instead. The robot has a rotating flexible frame that lets it bounce off anything that it hits in a chaotic environment. To stay upright, Gimball has a gyroscopic system that includes an accelerometer, the same type of sensor as used in smartphones to let the phone know which way is up. The battery-driven robot has two propellers, and is steered by fins. It is fitted with a motion sensor, a camera, an altimeter, a magnetic compass and a micro-controller processor. The 34cm (13 inch) , 370g (13oz) drone can lift weights of up to 30g, so can carry gas or radioactivity sensors, Mr Briod said. The robot can be remotely controlled, but Mr Briod aims to eventually incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities into Gimball to allow it to accomplish complex tasks by itself. The team that built Gimball at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL included Mr Briod and engineer Mariusz Kornatowski. </body>

      <title>IBM PC pioneer William C Lowe dies</title>
      <description>William C Lowe, who supervised the birth of IBM's first personal computer, dies aged 72 from a heart attack.</description>

      <body>William C Lowe, who supervised the birth of IBM's first personal computer, has died aged 72 in Lake Forest, Illinois. The IBM Personal Computer, known as the 5150, was launched in August 1981, several years after Apple had brought its first computer to market. Mr Lowe was instrumental in driving IBM's PC project from conception to manufacture within the space of a year. Until then, IBM had been primarily known for large, mainframe computers. Aware that IBM needed to play catch-up in the nascent PC market, Mr Lowe bypassed the company's rather cumbersome proprietary development process and brought in components from outside to speed things up. The operating system, MS-DOS 1.0, was provided by a little-known technology company called Microsoft, while the 8088 microprocessor came from Intel. It cost $1,565 - about $4,000 (£2,500) in today's money - without a monitor and was IBM's first foray into the consumer market. Mr Lowe studied physics at Lafayette College, Pennsylvania, and joined IBM in 1962 as a product test engineer. In 1975, he became director of development and manufacturing operations for the company's General Systems Division. Three years later, as laboratory director of the division's Boca Raton site in Florida, he hatched the idea of IBM selling an own-branded computer targeted at small businesses and consumers. Mr Lowe originally suggested using Atari to help IBM gain quick entry to the market, but this idea was rejected. Instead, management gave the go-ahead for him to develop a prototype made from off-the-shelf components. He assembled a team of 12 engineers to work on the Acorn Project (not to be confused with the UK's Acorn Computers) under the direction of Don Estridge. Part of the testing involved the computer's ability to run the Pac-Man game. "We didn't just design a computer; we created an industry," said Patty McHugh, Acorn project team member responsible for designing the PC's motherboard. The rest, as they say, is history. More than 250,000 IBM PCs were sold in the first year after its launch. As a reward for his efforts, Bill Lowe was promoted to vice president of the Information Systems Division and general manager of IBM's facility in Rochester, Minnesota. But the IBM PC was not, technically, the very first personal computer the company made. In 1973, IBM's General Systems Division produced a prototype called "Special computer, APL machine portable" (Scamp), also made from off-the-shelf materials and components. Scamp could be used as a desktop calculator and interactive programming device and led to the development of the IBM 5100 two years later. But the IBM PC was the first machine designed specifically for the mass market. The IBM PC project had highlighted the benefits of collaboration, and in 1985, IBM and Microsoft agreed to develop software together that could also run on other machines. But while Mr Lowe believed in the "open architecture" concept, it opened the back door to rival manufacturers who could build IBM-compatible machines more cheaply. It seemed to some that the approach had backfired, as IBM faced increasingly tough competition in the PC and software markets. Mr Lowe took a lot of the blame and this may have contributed to his decision to leave IBM in 1988 to join Xerox, the photocopier specialist, then looking to expand into other product areas. In 1991, he became president of corporate jet maker, Gulfstream. Mr Lowe died on 19 October 2013 from a heart attack. </body>

      <body>A 28-year-old British man has been arrested on suspicion of hacking into US military and US government computer systems. Lauri Love, arrested in Suffolk under the Computer Misuse Act, has been released on bail until next February. The US authorities claim he placed "back doors" in hacked networks to steal data. The arrest was the culmination of a joint investigation by the UK's National Crime Agency and the FBI. According to the US authorities, the arrested man hacked into systems of the US Army, Nasa and the Environmental Protection Agency, among others. He has been charged in the US with accessing a government computer without permission. US authorities, including the army, allege that information accessed included budgets, the disposal of military facilities, and personal information on thousands of people, including military personnel. Mr Love, from Stradishall, Suffolk, is accused of working with at least three others, who are not named. The alleged conspirators are said by prosecutors to have chatted online in secure web forums to identify targets, then hacked into thousands of computer systems. The suspected hackers allegedly placed "back doors", or code, to allow them to get back into the systems later to steal confidential information. The high-profile arrest is the latest in a series that have involved the UK's newly formed National Crime Agency. Last week the NCA launched a campaign to recruit up to 400 trainee cyber and intelligence officers. </body>

      <title>Turkey tunnel links Europe and Asia</title>
      <description>A railway line underneath the Bosphorus Strait opens in Istanbul, Turkey, the world's first sea tunnel connecting Europe and Asia.</description>

      <body>A railway tunnel underneath the Bosphorus Strait has been opened in Turkey, creating a new link between the Asian and European shores of Istanbul. The Marmaray tunnel is the world's first connecting two continents, and is designed to withstand earthquakes. It was inaugurated on the 90th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey. Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has for years championed the undersea engineering project, first conceived by an Ottoman sultan in 1860. Work began in 2004, but archaeological excavations delayed construction. The underwater section runs for 0.8 miles (1.4 km), but in total the tunnel is 8.5 miles (13.6 km) long. Japan invested $1bn of the $4bn (£3.4bn) total cost of the project, named Marmaray, which is a conflation of the nearby Sea of Marmara with "ray", the Turkish word for rail. The BBC's James Reynolds in Istanbul says the Turkish government hopes the new route under the Bosphorus will eventually develop into an important trading route. In theory it brings closer the day when it will be possible to travel from London to Beijing via Istanbul by train. The Marmaray project will upgrade existing suburban train lines to create a direct link joining the southern part of the city across the Bosphorus Strait. Istanbul is one of the world's biggest cities, with about 16 million people. Some two million, according to the AFP news agency, cross the Bosphorus every day via just two bridges, causing severe traffic congestion. The rail service will be capable of carrying 75,000 people per hour in either direction. "While creating a transport axis between the east and west points of the city, I believe it will soothe the problem" of congestion, said Istanbul's mayor Kadir Topbas. But critics of Prime Minister Erdogan have seen the tunnel as one of his grandiose construction projects for the city where he used to be mayor. Detractors of his proposals, including a third airport, a parallel canal, a third bridge over the Bosphorus and a second tunnel - for cars, south of Marmaray - say they illustrate Mr Erdogan's "pharaonic" ambitions. Authorities came under fire earlier this year when protesters opposed plans to redevelop a park in Istanbul. Widespread violence between anti-government demonstrators and security forces ensued. The rail tunnel is still not fully operational after Tuesday's opening, AFP reports. "The part that is in service is very limited. All that has been delayed until much later," said Tayfun Kahraman, president of the Istanbul Chamber of Urban Planners. "We are wondering why this inauguration is happening so soon." </body>

      <title>Bat virus clues to origins of Sars</title>
      <description>The discovery of Sars-like viruses in horseshoe bats could point to the origins of the human pathogen, researchers say.</description>

      <body>Researchers have found strong evidence that the Sars virus originated in bats. Two novel Sars-like coronaviruses were found in Chinese horseshoe bats which are closely related to the pathogen that infects humans. Critically, the viruses infect human cells in the same way, binding to a receptor called ACE2. This suggests coronaviruses could transfer directly from bats to humans, rather than via an intermediate species like civets as was previously thought. The results are reported in the journal Nature. According to Gary Crameri, virologist at CSIRO and an author on the paper, this research "is the key to resolving the continued speculation around bats as the origin of the Sars outbreaks". This Sars-like coronavirus is around 95% genetically similar to the Sars virus in humans, the research shows. And they say it could be used to develop new vaccines and drugs to combat the pathogen. The Sars outbreak between November 2002 and July 2003 resulted in more than 8,000 worldwide cases and more than 770 deaths. This, along with the ongoing endemic of the Mers-coronavirus demonstrates the threat to humans from novel coronaviruses. Dr Peter Daszak is the president of the EcoHealth Alliance and an author on the paper published in Nature. He said: "Coronaviruses evolve very rapidly. The ones we are seeing are exquisitely evolved to jump from one species to another, which is quite unusual for a virus. So the big question is why are they emerging now?" At wildlife markets in China other animals and humans come into close proximity with bats, creating an ideal environment for the virus to jump between species. Also, those hunting in or living near bat caves have a significant risk of infection from such viruses, which are excreted in bat faeces. Understanding the origins of infectious diseases like Sars could help scientists tackle future infectious viruses before they emerge, through knowing where they are likely to arise and which families of virus we are most vulnerable to, and taking action to prevent initial infection. Dr Daszak said it would cost "about $1.5bn to discover all the viruses in mammals. I think that would be a great investment because once you have done it, you can develop vaccines and get ready with test kits to find the first stage of emergence and stop it." </body>

      <description>Japanese hunting of dolphins, smaller whales and porpoises is threatening some species with extinction, an environmental group says.</description>

      <body>Japan's hunting of dolphins, smaller whales and porpoises is threatening some species with extinction in its coastal waters, a report by a British environmental group has said. The Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) report says that more than a million such creatures have been killed in Japanese hunts in the past 70 years. It says that each year thousands are killed despite conservation concerns. The Japanese government has not commented on the report. But it has consistently defended its coastal whaling as a longstanding tradition, a source of livelihood and necessary for scientific research. The government has also argued that small cetaceans should be excluded from the International Convention on Whaling. The BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo says that the Japanese practice of driving many dolphins and porpoises onto beaches to be slaughtered has drawn international condemnation. The EIA says that it is also unsustainable, and a danger to human health. Studies have found high levels of mercury and industrial chemicals like PCBs in dolphin and porpoise meat. One study found people living in one dolphin-eating community in central Japan have mercury levels five times higher than normal. "A comprehensive analysis of the available scientific data demonstrates unequivocally that there are grave concerns regarding the sustainability of these hunts," the EIA report says. It goes on to accuse the government of "displaying a lack of responsibility" in ensuring the sustainability of small cetacean populations in Japanese waters - warning that its annual quota of 16,000 dolphins is far too high. The EIA says that the quota is based on 20-year-old data and that dolphin populations are much lower now. The conservation status of each species varies, the report says, depending on its range and hunting practices. Catch limits for Dall's porpoises are 4.7-4.8 times higher than the safe threshold, it claims. For the striped dolphin, once the mainstay of the industry but now endangered and disappearing from some areas, catches have dropped from more than 1,800 in the 1980s to about 100 today. Our correspondent says that anyone who has seen the documentary The Cove will know how controversial Japan's annual dolphin hunt can be. Hundreds of animals are driven into a bay where men jump into the water and cut their throats, turning the sea red. </body>

      <title>Doubts over badger cull extension</title>
      <description>The Gloucestershire badger cull may not reach the target of killing 70% of badgers even after an eight-week extension, official documents confirm.</description>

      <body>The Gloucestershire badger cull may not reach a target of killing 70% of badgers even after being extended, a document seen by the BBC suggests. The culling licence will be revoked early if badger kills fall too low, says government agency Natural England. Ultimately, only half the badger population may be removed, meaning additional culling will be needed next year, according to the analysis. Opponents say the cull is "a huge failure" and should be stopped now. Officials are aware that perturbation - where badgers roam further afield and cause new outbreaks of TB in cattle - is likely to have happened in the Gloucestershire cull zone. This was a factor in the decision to extend the cull. A Natural England document seen by the BBC says the 70% target may not be achieved, even with an eight-week extension into December. A lower figure of 53% would force additional measures next year. "If the population is not reduced by at least 70% then additional culling may be required in the second year of culling," said the analysis. The document also reveals that if culling badgers proves too difficult in the winter months, the licence will be revoked early. "It is recommended that the daily removal rate of badgers is monitored closely and if the rate falls below projections (such that a significant reduction in badger numbers may not be achieved) then we should consider terminating culling operations (by revoking the licence) as in this scenario there is unlikely to be a net benefit from continued culling," said the document. Commenting on the figures, a spokesman for Natural England said: "We've given these figures based on what we consider to be realistic targets and although 540 [badgers] would give disease control benefits, we would want culling to reach the 70% target to ensure maximum disease control benefits." Natural England was unable to comment further because the document may be subject to legal processes, he added. A second document seen by the BBC confirms that in the initial six-week culling period, cages for trapping badgers and thermal imaging equipment for shooting were brought in by contractors because of problems with free shooting. In an email requesting an extension to the licence, the directors of the culling company in Gloucestershire said a number of factors had affected progress, including the need to maintain public safety and the behaviour of badgers in the cull zone. Crops that had yet to be harvested hampered free shooting in parts of the cull zone, while badgers shunned baits in favour of maize cobs and blackberries growing in fields. A spokesperson from the NFU said: "The NFU is not commenting on anything to do with operational matters. However, as we have said previously, there have been learning experiences as to the best way of carrying out the culls effectively throughout the operations and the knowledge learned will be essential for helping with future rollout of culls in areas where TB is rife." Badger culling is taking place in west Somerset and west Gloucestershire. Both six-week pilots have been granted extensions by Natural England, after culling teams failed to reach the target of 70% of badgers. Dominic Dyer, policy adviser for the wildlife charity Care for the Wild said the pilot badger culls were undertaken to establish the effectiveness, humaneness and safety of removing 70% of badgers from the cull areas over six weeks using free shooting of badgers at night as a killing method. He said the information on the six-week pilot cull in Gloucestershire showed it had "proved a huge failure". "Of the 704 badgers shot in six weeks, only 543 were free shot with the remaining 161 cage trapped," he said. He added that in both areas - Gloucestershire and Somerset - only 23% of 2,350 badgers in the cull areas were killed by free shooting. "Free shooting has clearly failed on a massive scale and the pilot culls should now be halted on this basis alone," he added. A spokesperson for Defra said: "The advice of the chief vet is clear that the more badgers removed in the first year of a four [year] cull, the greater and quicker the disease reduction benefits will be. His advice also states that the benefit of removing a greater proportion of the population is likely to outweigh the effect of perturbation. "Both cage trapping and controlled shooting have always been available to the cull companies. It is their decision how they wish to use the two methods." The continuing controversy over culling badgers is likely to add to pressure on Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who appears on Tuesday before the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs committee to answer questions on the policy. Ministers and the NFU say culling is needed to control TB in cattle, but animal welfare groups say the pilot culls are a failure and should be stopped immediately. </body>

      <title>World faces 'global wine shortage'</title>
      <description>The world is heading for a wine shortage, with global consumer demand already significantly outstripping supply, a report warns.</description>

      <body>The world is facing a wine shortage, with global consumer demand already significantly outstripping supply, a report has warned. The research by America's Morgan Stanley financial services firm says demand for wine "exceeded supply by 300m cases in 2012". It describes this as "the deepest shortfall in over 40 years of records". Last year, production also dropped to its lowest levels in more than four decades. Global production has been steadily declining since its peak in 2004, when supply outweighed demand by about 600m cases. The report by Morgan Stanley's analysts Tom Kierath and Crystal Wang says global wine consumption has been rising since 1996 (except a drop in 2008-09), and presently stands at about 3bn cases per year. At the same time, there are currently more than one million wine producers worldwide, making some 2.8bn cases each year. The authors predict that - in the short term - "inventories will likely be reduced as current consumption continues to be predominantly supplied by previous vintages" And as consumption then inevitably turns to the 2012 vintage, the authors say they "expect the current production shortfall to culminate in a significant increase in export demand, and higher prices for exports globally". They say this could be partly explained by "plummeting production" in Europe due to "ongoing vine pull and poor weather". Total production across the continent fell by about 10% last year, and by 25% since its peak in 2004. At the same time, production in the "new world" countries - the US, Australia, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, New Zealand - has been steadily rising. "With tightening conditions in Europe, the major new world exporters stand to benefit most from increasing demand on global export markets." The report says the French are still the world's largest consumers of wine (12%). But it adds that the US (also 12%) is now only marginally second. It also states that the US together with China - the world's fifth-largest market - are seen as "the main drivers of consumption globally". </body>

      <title>Norwegian town gets winter sunshine</title>
      <description>The people of Rjukan in Norway celebrate the installation of giant mountaintop mirrors, which have finally brought winter sunshine to their town centre.</description>

      <body>The people of Rjukan in Norway are celebrating the installation of giant mirrors, which have finally brought winter sunshine to their town centre. Rjukan lies in a deep valley, and during the six months of winter the surrounding mountains cast a shadow over the town even at midday. About 1,000 people, among them children in sunglasses, cheered when the main square became bathed in sun. The idea of using mirrors in Rjukan was first proposed 100 years ago. Rjukan's inhabitants gathered in the main square on Wednesday for the official inauguration of the mirrors. Some sipped cocktails on sun loungers, while others played beach volleyball on a makeshift sand court. As the sun's reflected rays illuminated the town square, a band played the song Let the Sunshine In, while Rjukan's townspeople cheered, among them hundreds of children with yellow suns painted on their faces, some waving Norwegian flags. "A hundred-year-old idea has become reality today," said Steinar Bergsland, mayor of the Tinn municipality which includes Rjukan. He said he hoped the mirrors would attract visitors to the region, which up till now has been associated more with the bravery of the men who sabotaged Hitler's attempt to develop the atomic bomb at a hydroelectric plant near Rjukan. The problem of how to bring sunshine to Rjukan was first considered a century ago by a Norwegian engineer and industrialist, Sam Eyde, who developed the town to provide workers for the power plant, which lies at the foot of a waterfall. At the time, the technology did not exist to fulfil his vision to harness the rays of the winter sun. Instead, a cable car was installed to bring Rjukan's inhabitants to the top of an adjacent mountain for a fix of winter sun. By the beginning of the 21st Century, the giant mirror plan had became a viable option, and the Italian village of Viganella installed a similar sun mirror in 2006. Rjukan's mirror project was revived in 2005 by Martin Andersen, an artist and town resident. Despite some initial opposition to the use of public money, a combination of private sponsorship and public investment eventually drew together the 5m Norwegian krone (£528,000; $851,000) needed to complete the project. The three mirrors, 17sq m each, were brought in by helicopter and placed on a mountain, about 450m above the centre of the town. Controlled by computers, the tilted mirrors follow the course of the sun to bring sunshine to Rjukan's main square below. Rjukan is a place "where the impossible has become possible" said Mr Bergsland. </body>

      <title>Rainforest people can monitor carbon</title>
      <description>Communities dependent upon the world's tropical forests can estimate an area's carbon stocks as effectively as hi-tech systems, a study shows.</description>

      <body>Communities living alongside the world's tropical forests can estimate an area's carbon stocks as effectively as hi-tech systems, a study has shown. An international team of researchers found communities using sticks and ropes obtained the same results as data gathered by satellites. They added that the study showed that projects aimed at halting deforestation needed to use these people's skills. The findings have been published in the journal Ecology and Society. "For the first time, we have shown that local communities are able to monitor forest biomass up to the highest standards of the [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change], even in the most species-rich forests on Earth," explained co-author Finn Danielsen, senior ecologist for Denmark-based NGO Nordic Foundation for Development and Ecology. "We are arguing that the (Redd) policy document is showing that they should be part of the process, but in reality they are not." Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (Redd) projects are one of the main mechanisms available to policymakers to curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from deforestation and land-use change. Current estimates suggest that deforestation and forest degradation accounts for about 15% of GHG emissions resulting from human activity. Under the schemes, such as the UN's Redd programme, developing nations are paid not to fell large areas of tropical forests. Redd+ projects also include other measures, such as conservation, sustainable forest management and the enhancement of forest carbon stocks. "If you want to have an impact on the ground, you have to involve the people who live in the area who depend on the resources provided by the forests," Mr Danielsen told BBC News. "You can do all sorts of remote sensing and national inventories of carbon stocks but if you do not involve local community members, you are going to have a very hard task linking all the factors together to have real implementation on the ground." With this in mind, the study - co-ordinated by the World Agroforestry Centre - identified 289 plots in nine forest types located in four countries in South-East Asia and compared the carbon stock estimates collected by local communities with the results gathered by professional foresters. Under-used resource Mr Danielsen observed: "We found that they obtained the same results, both in terms of accuracy and precision." He explained that the method used by the local communities was "very easy and very straightforward", using just basic instruments, including sticks and ropes. "They establish a plot in the forest that contains a typical composite of trees for the forest," he said. "Then they measure the trees and write down on a piece of paper how big the trees are and how many there are. "They then enter this data into a spreadsheet and then this spreadsheet can tell us how much carbon is stored in that particular plot. "If that plot is representative of the area then you can calculate how much carbon is stored in the forest." The team hoped its findings would show that forest communities were an under-used resource when it came to the monitoring aspects of Redd projects. "At the international level, we are saying that we have got to find ways for Redd to be having a true impact on the forests around the world," Mr Danielsen commented. "At a national level, we would like to send the message to government departments that it is possible for local communities to do the job. "We are not saying that they can do it better or they should do it alone, we are just saying that they can do it just as well as government foresters and foresters from the private sector." The study's publication coincides with the start of the Redd Exchange 2013 in Oslo, Norway. Organisers say the two-day gathering of 400 experts in the Norwegian capital city aims to renew the forests and climate change agenda in light of the experience of Redd projects to date. </body>

      <title>Hedgehog 'backpacks' to aid survival</title>
      <description>Hedgehogs which have been nursed back to health are being fitted with GPS "backpacks" to find out how they go on to survive in the wild.</description>

      <body>Hedgehogs which have been nursed back to health are being fitted with GPS "backpacks" to find out how they go on to survive in the wild. The 24 hedgehogs, cared for at Shepreth Wildlife Park in Cambridgeshire, will have their movements tracked. The animals will be released in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire on Wednesday. Rebecca Willers, chairwoman of Shepreth Wildlife Conservation Charity, hopes the study can eventually boost survival rates of rehabilitated hedgehogs. The £150 devices weigh just over 1.8oz (50g) and have been designed for the project by Dr David Wallis of Ecometry Technologies. An inch-square section of spines will be clipped on each creature's back with the battery-powered backpacks then glued on. This will take place as the hedgehog is coming around from an anaesthetic, which will be administered so the charity's vet can give them a health check. The tracking device, which uses satellite positioning, will be monitored on a computer. It will fall off when the animal naturally sheds its spikes in a few months. Miss Willers hopes the pioneering study will run for a number of years if funding can be found. "The over-arching aim is to see if hedgehogs survive in the wild after rehabilitation in what is a plastic environment," she said. "But the most important aspect is to find out if hedgehogs go on to reproduce and if rehabilitation is helping the hedgehog population as a whole. "In 10 years we want to have a comprehensive guide of the best release sites and methods." The animals are being set free at both rural and urban sites in Shepreth on the Hertfordshire/Cambridgeshire border, Ely in Cambridgeshire and West Stow and Beck Row in Suffolk. This year researchers hope to discover if captive hedgehogs revert to their natural behaviour once released. "The point of this study is to find the best release weights for hibernation and to discover if they are actually going to go into hibernation," said Miss Willers. Pre-release pens have been set up at the park and are housing the hedgehogs as they get used to living outside. "We wouldn't be releasing animals if they were not at optimum fitness," said Miss Willers. "Nothing is being put at risk." Before the study was finalised, the hedgehogs were put under 24-hour surveillance for two weeks to see if the GPS packs caused any ill-effects. Volunteers have also been assigned to each location and if an animal stops moving they will investigate. The £9,500 cost of the research has been funded by the British Hedgehog Preservation Society. A report published in 2011 said hedgehog numbers were believed to have fallen by a quarter in a decade. </body>

      <body>Scientists have shed more light on how the movements of a dog's tail are linked to its mood, in a study published in the journal Current Biology. Earlier research had revealed that happy dogs wag their tails more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs have a left-dominated swish. But now scientists say that fellow canines can spot and respond to these subtle tail differences. Dr John Bradshaw of Bristol University, an expert in anthrozoology, told the BBC's Sarah Montague: "We now know that dogs are reading each others' body language". "I'm sure dogs teach each other things," added novelist and dog lover Jilly Cooper, as she reflected on the way her dogs copied each other in "racing around the lawn".

      <body>More than four decades ago the golden eagle was awarded the same protections under US law as the country's national bird, the bald eagle. Even disturbing their nests is a criminal offence. The raptor is not considered to be under threat but scientists are worried about a recent increase in the number of golden eagles killed by wind turbines. Eagles in flight tend to focus on the ground below as they look for prey, unaware of the fast-spinning blades in their paths until it's too late. The wind energy industry says such deaths account for a tiny percentage of human-caused deaths of eagles. It says it is working with the government to help protect birds. The BBC spent a day with a scientists from the US Fish and Wildlife Service in New Mexico who fit transmitters to the backs of eagles in an effort to find out more about their lives - and deaths.

      <body>A collection of newly published research has revealed how the sauropods - the biggest dinosaurs ever to have roamed the Earth - moved, fed and functioned. The biggest of the sauropods, including the famous diplodocus, weighed up to 80 tonnes. Professor Kent Stevens from the University of Oregon has used digital skeleton simulations to resolve the question of whether sauropods held their heads high or out to the front with their incredibly long necks. He told BBC News that if you "let the bones tell the story," it is clear that these giants would not have the flexibility in their necks to pull them high above their heads. Instead, as this simulation reveals, the sauropod Apatosaurus (formerly and perhaps more famously known as Brontosaurus) could place its head at any point across an "enormous feeding surface". The collection of papers on "Sauropod gigantism" is published in the journal PLoS One. Simulation courtesy of Kent A Stevens, University of Oregon </body>

      <body>India is preparing to send a robotic spacecraft into orbit around Mars - a first for the country. Yogita Limaye from the BBC's India Business Report spoke to K Radhakrishnan, chair of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) - the country's space agency - about his hopes for the mission. A: Essentially in this Mars mission, which we are planning, the prime objective is to demonstrate India's capability to capture the Martian orbit and then to conduct a few meaningful scientific experiments. A: See, essentially when we talk about Mars and exploration of Mars, you look at life as one of those goals. So (we look for) the presence of methane in the Martian environment and see whether this methane, if it is there, has a biological origin or a geological origin. We also would like to study the Martian atmosphere and the escape processes there. A: No, see Curiosity is measuring the presence of methane in a small area where it is there today. We are talking about the entire Martian environment. So Curiosity saying "no" is not a point to be worried about. A: Any mission to Mars has to be done in an opportune window and the imminent window is November 2013, that is we need to get out of this sphere of influence of earth by 30 November to ensure that we have the minimum distance between Earth and Mars. Now we are launching this Mars orbiter from Sriharikota in the east coast of India in the first week of November and then the PSLV-XL (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle) is used for the launch which will put this orbiter into an elliptical orbit around the Earth... then around the last week of November, we have a crucial operation, it's called the "trans-Martian injection" where the spacecraft is directed towards Mars. Then it is a long voyage of 300 days where the orbiter spacecraft passes through the sphere of influence of the Earth... Then it goes through a long phase of heliocentric flight where the orbiter spacecraft will be influenced not only by the Sun but by the other planets too. Then as it approaches Mars... we have another major action: capturing the orbit of Mars, which is on 21st of September 2014. A: Soon after the orbiter is put into the orbit of Mars, we would start the experimentation and even before this orbiter reaches the Martian environment we would be calibrating these instruments as it travels from Earth to Mars. But the most important part of it is looking at the distances involved. It takes at least 20 minutes for any signal to come from the Mars orbiter to Earth in some phases. It could be anything between four to 20 minutes one-way. A: Why India has to be in the space programme is a question that has been asked over the last 50 years. The answer then, now and in the future will be: "it is for finding solutions to the problems of man and society." And in this area, India has become a role model for the whole world. Let me talk in terms of numbers. We spend in India about a billion dollars for the space programme. If we look at the central government expenditure, we spend 0.34% of its budget for the space programme. This goes primarily for building satellites in communications and remote sensing and navigation for space applications. Nearly 35% of it goes on launch vehicle development and about 7-8% goes on the science and exploration programme. So the Mars mission we're talking about today is part of that 8% of the 0.34% of Indian central government expenditure. And if you look at the benefit that the country has accrued over the years, it has surpassed the money that has been spent in terms of tangible and intangible benefits. [This can be expressed in terms of] the advantage that the people have got, the fishermen have got, the farmers have got, the government bodies have got for informed decision-making, the support the country has got for disaster management and by providing a communication infrastructure for this country using the INSAT satellites. Today we have nearly 10 communication satellites and 10 remote sensing satellites in orbit. This is a great revolution that has taken place over these last 50 years in the country by a meagre expenditure that has been put into the space programme. A: See, Chandrayaan-1 was an orbiter, but Chandrayaan-2 as you said looks at the surface of the Moon using a rover and a landing module there. In 2009-2010, we planned this as a joint mission where India was to provide the launch and the orbiter and Russia was to provide the lander and the rover. Over these years there has been a programmatic realignment on this and, as of now, the plan is that the rover will be made by India and the lander will also be developed by India, and we must have this lander developed by the year 2016. Now, we also require a reliable GSLV (Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle rocket) for launching Chandrayaan-2. In December 2013, we are going to launch the GSLV T5 rocket with our own cryogenic engine stage. If that is successful, and we are able to have one more successful flight of the GSLV, then we would be ready - from the launch angle - for Chandrayaan-2. So, this is the scenario emerging and there will be scientific experiments in the lander module and in the rover, and a few in the orbiter too. Yes, 2016 is the correct target and the limiting factor for that is the development of the lander module. A: See, as of now we have no declared programme on human space flight, but in the year 2006-07 we began a study... and as of now we have taken up the critical new technologies that India needs to master a human space flight. The core module development, environment control and life support systems, the crew escape system, these are all part of that and we are working on it at the moment. But we require a human-rated vehicle that is capable of taking the crew module into a lower orbit. So you need to have a reliable GSLV for a manned mission or a GSLV Mark 3 developed and then manned-rated. A: As of now, there is no timeline for a mission but we are working on the development of the critical technologies required for it. A: Let me first say each country has its own priorities and focus. Right from the beginning, right from the early sixties, India's focus has been on peaceful uses of outer space and space applications and there India is today a role model for the whole world. One can be proud of it. China has its own priorities and it is moving in that direction. So, we are not in a race with anybody, but I would say we are in a race with ourselves. We need to excel, we need to improve, and we need to bring new services. We need to do it more cost-effectively and deliver it to the target audience in the country, whether it is to the people or the government or other agencies in the country. So that has been the focus of the Indian space programme. This interview has been abridged for reasons of article length. </body>

      <title>Benefits and risks of badger cull extension</title>
      <description>Assessing the decision to extend the pilot badger culls</description>

      <body>Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and the chief vet Nigel Gibbens have been explaining why they extended the pilot badger culls in Somerset and Gloucestershire. BBC science correspondent Pallab Ghosh examines the reasons for the extension. The Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) set itself the target of culling an average of 70% of badgers within the pilot cull areas over a six-week period, sustained for four years. Indeed, these were the terms of the licence granted by Natural England for the culls. The companies charged with culling the badgers have fallen short of the target, reducing populations by 60% in west Somerset and 30% in west Gloucestershire. Mr Gibbens's advice was to carry on culling in both areas to control the spread of the disease. On the face of it that might make sense to some. Surely if there are fewer badgers then the risk of TB in cattle is lowered? And what is wrong with going beyond the six week period to do so? A spokesperson from Defra's press office told BBC News that the six-week culling period was arbitrary. "Six weeks was set as the cull period by wildlife experts," he said. "It is not based on scientific evidence so it's impossible to say culling beyond six weeks necessarily increases perturbation - it's a theory but not conclusive," the spokesperson said. Scientists involved with the original Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT), on which the strategy for the current pilot culls are based, take issue with this interpretation. Their concern arises from the data they obtained from the RBCT, which was carried out between 1998 and 2005 to assess the effectiveness of badger culling. The RBCT mostly involved a series of short, sharp culls carried out over a period of two weeks in TB hot spots. There were, however, four trials that were carried out over a longer period. The researchers found that after the first cull, TB infection in badgers increased the following year because of the increased movement of badgers (perturbation). They found that there was a bigger increase in areas where the culling was prolonged. A number of expert panels, including Defra's own Science Advisory Council and TB group, concluded that a modest reduction in TB in cattle could be obtained if the culls were short, sharp and carried out each year for four years. The group suggested in 2010 that 70% of badgers should be killed in a large area over a period of between four and six weeks. There was evidence from the RBCT that culling beyond two weeks might cause problems, but a figure of four to six was chosen because it was judged it would be impractical to kill that many badgers within two weeks in a large area. It was however generally accepted that the longer the cull went on, the less likely that TB infection would be reduced. In making a judgment to extend the culls in Gloucestershire and Somerset, Mr Gibbens considered two competing factors. On one hand, continuing the cull would reduce the badger population. Yet on the other, it would also increase the movement by badgers and so spread infection in the population. Mr Gibbens made the judgment that continuing was, on balance, the preferable option. A Defra spokesperson said: "The RBCT found that an average 70% reduction over four years resulted in a disease reduction. It did not stipulate the length of time in which culling needed to be carried out, or at what level of population decrease disease benefits begin to accrue. That is a key part of Nigel's advice that the more badgers you remove, the greater the benefits." But critics of the policy argue there is no evidence for how the two competing factors could play out. Prof Rosie Woodroffe, who was involved with the RBCT already had concerns about expanding the culling period from two weeks to six. "Going from six to 14 weeks (as they have in the Gloucestershire cull area) is uncharted territory," she told BBC News. "It is not unreasonable to expect that as you prolong the cull and you prolong increased badger movement, you increase the detrimental effects." There is also an additional concern for Defra. A piece of research for the department carried out by Prof Christl Donnelly indicated that culling in the winter months increased infection in the badger population still further.

      <title>Thorium backed as a 'future fuel'</title>
      <description>Could thorium usher in a new era of nuclear power?</description>

      <body>Nuclear scientists are being urged by the former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix to develop thorium as a new fuel. Mr Blix says that the radioactive element may prove much safer in reactors than uranium. It is also more difficult to use thorium for the production of nuclear weapons. His comments will add to growing levels of interest in thorium, but critics warn that developing new reactors could waste public funds. Mr Blix, the former Swedish foreign minister, told BBC News: "I’m a lawyer not a scientist but in my opinion we should be trying our best to develop the use of thorium. I realise there are many obstacles to be overcome but the benefits would be great. "I am told that thorium will be safer in reactors - and it is almost impossible to make a bomb out of thorium. These are very major factors as the world looks for future energy supplies." His enthusiasm is shared by some in the British nuclear establishment. Scientists at the UK’s National Nuclear Laboratory (NNL) have been encouraged by the government to help research on an Indian thorium-based reactor, and on a test programme in Norway. The Norway tests at the OECD’s nuclear trials facility in Halden are conducted in a Bond-style underground bunker. A couple of charming Nordic homes perch on top of a hill at the edge of the town. Below them a garage door in a cliff face leads into a tunnel deep into the hill where the reactor hall lies. In theory, at least, the mountain protects the town from an accident. The thorium tests are being carried out by a private firm, Thor Energy (the element itself was discovered in Norway in 1828 and named after the Norse god of thunder). The company hopes to get thorium licensed alongside uranium in current water-cooled reactor plants. The British government says it would be useful to increase the fuel options for nuclear operators, as thorium is believed to be three times more plentiful than uranium. It is also currently being produced as a by-product from mining rare earths. Staff from NNL have been advising Thor on the use of mixed oxide fuels (MOX). NNL has also been helping the Indian authorities develop a thorium reactor, as India sits on top of the world’s biggest thorium reserves. The Thor project represents an evolutionary approach, using thorium in existing reactors together with uranium or plutonium. Oystein Asphjell, chief executive of Thor Energy told BBC News: "There is lots of thorium in the world, very well distributed all over the globe. In operations, in a reactor, it has some chemical and physical properties that make it really superior to uranium as well. On the waste side, we don’t generate long lived waste." China is going for a revolutionary approach, devising a next-generation reactor which its supporters say will enable thorium to be used much more safely than uranium. When a uranium reactor overheats and the fuel rods can’t contain the chain reaction, as happened at Fukushima, the crisis continues. If something happened to a thorium reactor, technicians could simply switch off the stimulus which comes from uranium or plutonium in a small feeder plant and the thorium reaction would halt itself. Prof Carlo Rubbia from Cern previously told BBC News: "Thorium will be able to shut itself off without any human intervention... You just switch off the beam.” "There are also no long-lived waste products... We estimate that after something like 400-500 years all the radioactivity will be dissipated away." These advantages, if they were realised, would be huge. But thorium still has many technical problems to overcome. What is more, countless billions have been ploughed into uranium-based research and development, and in the words of Mr Blix, uranium has a very deep furrow, backed by vested interests. Canada, China, Germany, India, the Netherlands, the UK and the US have experimented with thorium as a substitute fuel in the past. Questions are being raised, though, about the advisability of pinning the world’s energy ambitions on another nuclear dream. Environmentalists often allege that if renewable power had commanded a fraction as much research funding as nuclear it would already be much cheaper and more common. Dr Nils Bohmer, a nuclear physicist working for a Norwegian environmental NGO, Bellona, said developing thorium was a costly distraction from the need to cut emissions immediately to stave off the prospect of dangerous climate change. "The advantages of thorium are purely theoretical," he told BBC News. "The technology development is decades in the future. Instead I think we should focus on developing renewable technology - for example offshore wind technology - which I think has a huge potential to develop.” If thorium ever makes it as a commercial nuclear fuel, uranium may be seen as a massive and costly diversion. Some supporters of thorium believe that it was bypassed in the past because governments wanted the plutonium from certain conventional reactors to make atomic bombs. They believe thorium was rejected because it was simply too safe. Follow Roger on Twitter </body>

      <title>Secrets of the dino-titans revealed</title>
      <description>Computers reveal secrets of the sauropods</description>

      <body>In an era of giants, sauropods dwarfed everything. These dinoasurs, including the diplodocus, were the biggest to walk the Earth. T. rex would have nipped at the knees of the largest sauropod - Argentinosaurus huinculensis. University of Manchester researchers have now made a digital Argentinosaurus robot to work out how this 80-tonne monster would have moved its vast bulk. The study is published in an issue of PLoS One on "sauropod gigantism". The immense size of sauropods - the long-necked, tree-trunk-legged storybook giants of the Jurassic period - presents a quandary for biologists because they push animal bones and muscles to their limit. This is why researchers have set out to answer some of the big questions about these very big animals, including: How did their muscles and bones support and move their bodies? How did their digestive system process sufficient food? And how high could they have reached with their immensely long necks (much longer, proportionally, than a giraffe's)? "The biggest elephants weigh around six or seven tonnes," said Dr Bill Sellers, of the University of Manchester, who led the digital robot study. "So Argentinosaurus was at least 10 times bigger than the biggest elephant. "As you get bigger your weight goes up by the cube of your height, but the force your muscles can generate only goes up by the square, so your strength-to-weight ratio gets much worse." As with many dinosaurs, the reconstructions of this giant are based on a relatively limited fossilised jigsaw. For Argentinosaurus, only its legs and part of its spine have been unearthed. So controversy has raged over whether it was possible for an animal to be so huge and heavy and still able to walk on land. "Whenever anyone finds a dinosaur, they want it to be the biggest, meanest dinosaur ever, so there might be a temptation to make a reconstruction a bit bigger than it was," Dr Sellers told BBC News. "We wanted to test whether it was a reasonable reconstruction for an animal." To make the digital dinosaur, Dr Sellers and his colleagues scanned a reconstructed skeleton housed at the Carmen Funes municipal museum in Argentina. They were able to map muscles and tendons on to the skeleton using the anatomy of modern animals, including reptiles and birds, as a guide. Then came the difficult part - their digital dinosaur had to learn to walk. This, Dr Sellers said, required a technique called "machine learning". "The animal needs to learn how to move the best way it can using the muscles and skeleton we've given it," he said. This took a huge amount of computer processing power, as the simulated dinosaur robot took the information programmed into its virtual muscles and worked out how to use them to walk. The resulting steady march of this digital dinosaur revealed that, to keep its body steady, the movement at its joints had to be very restricted. "This animal is so big that it's right at the limit of what you could cope with as an animal that lives on land," said Dr Sellers. "So things like getting up off the ground would have been extraordinarily difficult if not impossible." Something else these beasts would not have been capable of, according to Prof Kent Stevens, of the University of Oregon, would be adopting the storybook pose of holding their heads aloft. He says that while "soaring necks is congruous with childhood expectations, the bones tell a different story". For his study, Prof Stevens also created virtual dinosaurs - digitally reconstructing the skeleton of Apatosaurus (better known in the past as brontosaurus). Dr Stevens said: " [If we] put sauropod neck vertebrae back together with the proper separations, and they form a very straight line." He says the bones simply do not have the curves seen in giraffes' or some birds' necks. A natural J-curve in a giraffe's vertebrae direct its neck upwards at a steep angle. A vertebral S-curve gives a swan its shapely neck. But while Prof Stevens' less soaring reconstructions of these dinosaurs might puncture childhood myths, his digital dinosaurs were still capable of impressive feats, thanks to their huge size. As his animations reveal, by sweeping its outstretched neck, Apatosaurus would have explored, and devoured food, over a huge space. "While none were very flexible, sauropods could sweep out broad areas - in some cases 10 or so metres above the ground," Prof Stevens said. All this sweeping and devouring provided a digestive challenge for these huge herbivores. And Dr Marcus Clauss, of the Clinic for Zoo Animals at the University of Zurich in Switzerland, set out to find out how their digestive systems coped. Just as Dr Sellers found that normal bones and muscles could carry 80 tonnes of bulk, it seems there was also nothing unusual about the sauropod gut. "A normal gut can work for any size of body," said Dr Clauss. "A mouse can get enough energy for its size, and an elephant can. The main thing is that [the elephant] eats much more." One key factor that seems to have allowed sauropods to become so gigantic is that they would swallow their food without chewing. As this unchewed food would spend so much time passing through extremely long intestines, it would have ample time to break down. "If you spend so much time chewing, you're limited in the amount of food you can take in," Dr Clauss said. "So one of the conditions for an animal to become that large is that it must not chew." The secret to just how massive these creatures were could be contained in their ancient fossilised trackways. Dr Tom Schanz, of Ruhr University in Germany, has lent his engineering skills to the study of dinosaurs by developing a technique to estimate sauropod weight from a single footprint. He is an engineer who studies the properties of soil to work out exactly how buildings will settle and move on their foundations. Dr Schanz's new method incorporates this expertise. His laser scanning of preserved footprints could produce the most accurate measurements yet of what the dinosaurs weighed. To prove this, Dr Schanz's team took an elephant for a walk. The researchers studied every "dynamic component" of the walk - measuring the speed at which the elephant planted its feet, and how its weight was distributed in each step. "[Then we used the] laser scanning technique on the elephant footprints and back-calculated the weight," Dr Schanz said. The team was able to calculate the elephant's weight to within 10%. And since sauropods and elephants have such similar anatomy, the scientist says the same technique could be used to estimate the weight of the extinct dinosaurs. Building up an accurate picture of how these animals worked is revealing some of the most basic aspects of biology, including how bones and muscles work, and what the very limits are of their ability to function. "That's very important," Dr Sellers says, "because these things go wrong very commonly, and the better we understand them, the better our chances are of fixing them." </body>

      <description>Rare glimpse of one of the most sophisticated US spy planes</description>

      <body>The Global Hawk is one of the US military's most sophisticated spy planes and the BBC was able to get a rare view of one at Grand Forks Airbase in North Dakota. It can travel halfway round the world on a single tank of fuel and can track a man on the ground, even when the earth is covered by cloud, from a height of about 18,000m - that's close to 60,000ft. That means it could in theory peer into Syria to track chemical weapons while still flying in international airspace. Or keep track of North Korea's nuclear programme flying from the Pacific island of Guam. The man in charge of operations at Grand Forks, Colonel Lawrence Spinetta, says the Hawk "spans the globe on a daily basis, 24-7, providing some great intelligence for senior decision makers", though he won't be drawn on details. The use of drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft, as the US Military prefers to call them, is highly controversial, not least because of the clandestine killings carried out by armed CIA drones, such as the Reaper and Predator. Some Americans are worried about the way drones can be used to carry out surveillance at home; 17 US states have passed laws limiting their use. But North Dakota, which is sparsely populated and has wide-open empty spaces, appears more relaxed. The University of North Dakota is one of the first in the US to offer a degree course in how to operate drones. While the Global Hawk is not armed there is still a lot of secrecy surrounding its use. At Grand Forks airbase, there is still little sign that the US military is about to lift the lid. The crew of the United States Air Force (USAF) even remove their name badges to avoid identification. We were asked to leave any recording devices, cameras or phones behind as we were shown one of the "shelters" from which the Global Hawk is flown. Outside it looks like a shipping container. Inside, there are banks of screens, though for this visit they had all been switched off. The Operations Room, which oversees missions, is firmly out of bounds behind a heavy door with a secure entry code. We are, however, allowed to witness a pilot carry out a simulated mission from his desk. One of the pilots admits he misses what he calls the "seat-of-the-pants feeling" you get while in the air. He says "it's not as exciting as flying a manned aircraft", but adds that it is rewarding in other ways. The aircrew speak positively about being able to fly missions anywhere in the world without leaving the comforts of home or the family behind. That is perhaps one reason why a pilot can feel "a little detached", even if he or she is totally focused on the mission. But these unmanned aircraft are the future. The Nato alliance doesn't usually purchase its own military hardware but its members have clubbed together to buy five Global Hawks at a cost of $1.7bn (1.2bn euros). By 2017 they will be flying out of Sigonella in Sicily with the potential to cover maritime security as well as supporting troops on the ground. Those who manufacture drones are keen to highlight their utility beyond the battlefield. Bob Zeiser, who helps run the Global Hawk programme at Northrop Grumman, says the Global Hawk has been involved in helping out in the aftermath of natural disasters. In 2010, one flew over Haiti following a devastating earthquake, where it mapped the devastation and helped direct rescue efforts. It was able to conduct the mission from California and survey the entire country three times before returning to base. More recently, a Global Hawk was used to assess the damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. Mr Zeiser acknowledges there's still a challenge in winning around the public, but he says the negative perceptions can be overcome by showing the public that drones are safe to fly and that they are a good way of keeping people out of harm's way. But there are still plenty of questions as to how drones can be safely integrated into civilian airspace and how the rest of us feel about being watched by an unblinking eye in the sky. </body>

      <title>Flying car dream is becoming reality</title>
      <description>Why flying cars may finally be ready for launch</description>

      <body>In 1940 Henry Ford famously said: "Mark my word: A combination airplane and motorcar is coming. You may smile, but it will come." Just nine years later Moulton Taylor had designed and flown his Aerocar, proving the viability of Ford's fantastical concept. But only three models were ever built, and the dream of a viable vehicle that can offer freedom both in the air and on the road has remained frustratingly elusive. Until now that is. Technology - "sense and avoid" avionics, computer-aided design, and materials science - has advanced to such a degree that safety authorities are tantalisingly close to giving full approval to flying cars. "Since the Wright Brothers and Henry Ford we've had the dream of marrying the plane and the car," said Dick Knapinski, spokesman for the US Experimental Aircraft Association, "but engineering, regulatory and cultural hurdles have always got in the way. "Now we are really getting closer to making the dream come true." For example, in July this year, Boston-based company Terrafugia showed off its Transition "roadable aircraft" at the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) AirVenture event in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. "We have an experimental airworthiness certificate from the FAA [US Federal Aviation Authority] which means we still have to stay away from populated areas," said Richard Gersh, Terrafugia's vice-president of business development, "but everything is going to plan to achieve full certification." The Transition, whose wings fold up against the body of the carriage, is also licensed for testing on the road, but Mr Gersh emphasises its primary function is as an aircraft. "We don't envisage this replacing your family car, and you'll always have to take off and land at an airport," he said. "But it does give you the flexibility of driving to the airport and to your destination at the other end." When the Transition eventually goes on sale - which could be in two years, depending on how long full safety certification takes - it will retail for about $280,000 (£173,000), slightly cheaper than a Cessna Skyhawk fixed-wing plane. The company has already received more than 100 orders, said Mr Gersh. Les Dorr, FAA spokesman, told the BBC: "If a 'flying car' is intended to operate on US highways then the vehicle has to conform to both the applicable US Department of Transportation standards for a car and the applicable aviation standards for an aircraft. "Terrafugia is the only US aircraft certification project that has obtained an exemption or for which we've defined the certification requirements with both the FAA and NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]." Looking to the future, Terrafugia's concept craft - the TF-X - will incorporate vertical take-off and landing thanks to hinged propellers on the foldable wings combined with a rear propeller for forward propulsion. It will be a plug-in hybrid electric flying car promising a top speed of 200mph (320km/h) and a range of about 500 miles. The company envisages incorporating existing autopilot and new sense-and-avoid technology to help it steer clear of air traffic, bad weather and restricted airspace. It will also include a full parachute system in case of total engine failure, and an auto-land capability if the pilot becomes incapacitated. But Mr Gersh estimates that the TF-X is "about eight to 10 years away" from becoming a reality. Another US outfit, the Indigenous Peoples' Technology and Education Center (I-TEC), has developed the Maverick LSA, a rough terrain buggy that can fly using a rear propeller and parachute combination. Built by Beyond Roads, it is designed to aid humanitarian missions to difficult-to-reach areas. The parachute is hoisted up a flexible mast to prevent it fouling the rear propeller. At the moment, the vehicle is treated as a "kit car" for regulatory purposes and also has a Special Light Sport Aircraft airworthiness certificate. Stefan Klein, co-founder and chief designer at Slovakian firm Aeromobil, caught the flying car bug as a child after watching the French filmFantomas se Dechaine, featuring a Citroen DS that could turn into a rocket-powered plane. A graduate of the Slovak University of Technology and a former head of research projects for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design, he comes from a family of aviators and has spent about 20 years trying to make his dream come true. The svelte-looking "pre-prototype" 2.5, which made its debut flight in Montreal in September this year, is potentially the shape of things to come. With hinged wings that sweep forward for flight, a top air speed of more than 200km/h (124mph) and flight range of 700km (430 miles), the Aeromobil certainly looks like a credible player in the nascent flying car market. But spokeswoman Tatiana Veberova admits: "We haven't even begun to solve the problem of certification yet. We have a long way to go." The 3.0 prototype is likely to be ready in 2014, she said, and the company intends to target the US market where regulatory acceptance is more advanced than in Europe. So technology is finally making flying cars a viable product for the mass market, and regulators are certainly catching up with the speed of development. But are we really ready for motorways in the sky? "Lots of people are still afraid of flying," says Mr Knapinksi at the EAA. "There's a mystery about it. That's also part of its joy. "Gaining cultural acceptance for flying cars will be the last hurdle to overcome." </body>

      <title>Homer Simpson's scary maths problems</title>
      <description>The numbers hidden in The Simpsons Halloween episode</description>

      <body>For a character living in two dimensions, grasping the idea of life in 3D can be tough - especially if the character in question is Homer Simpson. But one Halloween episode of The Simpsons forces him to confront the concept, and gives viewers a mathematical workout too. Eighteen years ago, the writers of The Simpsons celebrated Halloween with one of their traditional Treehouse of Horror episodes, which included three short stories. After Attack of the 50-Foot Eyesores and Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace, viewers were treated to Homer³, which contains the most intense five minutes of mathematics ever to appear on prime time television. For many people, mathematics is more terrifying than being attacked by an army of zombies, werewolves and vampires, but in this case the various equations were included because the writer of Homer³, David S Cohen, is a fan of numbers. The storyline involves Homer diving through a portal and entering a peculiar three-dimensional universe. When he senses his new extra-dimensionality, Homer says: "What's going on here? I'm so bulgy. My stomach sticks way out in front." It is a particularly memorable plot, because the animation changes from the classic Springfield-style to futuristic computer graphics when Homer enters the portal. It is within this computer-generated landscape that eagle-eyed number nerds (like myself) can discover Cohen's mathematical nuggets. For example, in one scene, the letters P and NP can be seen over Homer's right shoulder. Although these three letters would have made no sense to most viewers, they are a deliberate nod towards a statement about one of the most important unsolved problems in theoretical computer science. Indeed, this is such a weighty puzzle that there is a reward of $1m (£623,000) for whoever solves the mystery. P stands for polynomial and NP for non-deterministic polynomial. One way to think about these terms is that P-type problems are essentially easy to solve, while NP-type problems are difficult. The question for mathematicians is whether NP-type problems are fundamentally hard, or whether there might be a trick that could turn these hard problems into easy P-type problems. It is surprising to find a reference to P- and NP-type problems in a television sitcom, but not when the writer is Cohen, because he studied them while doing his master's degree at the University of California in Berkeley. Meanwhile, back in Springfield, Professor Frink is giving Chief Wiggum and others an impromptu introduction to the mathematics of higher dimensions in order to explain what happened to Homer when he disappeared through the portal. Of course, the notion of a third dimension is baffling from Chief Wiggum's two-dimensional perspective, so Frink draws a diagram: Professor Frink: Here is an ordinary square. Chief Wiggum: Whoa, whoa! Slow down, egghead! Professor Frink: But suppose we extend the square beyond the two dimensions of our universe along the hypothetical z-axis... There. Everyone: [gasps] Professor Frink: This forms a three-dimensional object known as a cube, or a Frinkahedron in honour of its discoverer. Perhaps the most striking piece of mathematics in Homer³ is a reference to Fermat's last theorem, the most notorious problem in the history of mathematics. According to the 17th Century French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, it is impossible to find two numbers raised to the 12th power that equal a third number raised to the 12th power, but this equation from Homer³ seems to defy Fermat's claim: 1,782¹² + 1,841¹² = 1,922¹² Indeed, a quick check on your phone calculator will suggest that Homer has proven Fermat to be wrong. However, this is not an actual solution, but merely a so-called near-miss solution, which means that only a highly accurate calculating device (with more decimal places than the display on the average calculator) will see the slight imbalance in the equation. In other words, Cohen was playing a Halloween prank on viewers. It was this bit of mathematical tomfoolery that first caught my attention when I watched Homer³, and I only spotted the other references on second and third viewings. In time, I realised that there were several mathematical writers on The Simpsons, and indeed there are many other episodes alluding to number theory and geometry. However, as yet I have failed to discover any appearance by the number 1,000,000,000,000,066,600,000,000,000,001. This is a great shame, as it is a terrifying number and would be particularly suitable for a Halloween episode of The Simpsons. It is known as Belphegor's prime. It is a prime number because nothing will divide into it except one and the number itself, and it is named after Belphegor (one of the seven princes of hell) because it has 666 at its heart and 13 zeroes either side of the number of the beast. Perhaps the writers of The Simpsons are saving it for next year's Treehouse of Horror episode.

      <title>US spy leaks: How intelligence is gathered</title>
      <description>What spying methods do NSA leaks reveal?</description>

      <body>Documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden suggest the US government has undertaken mass surveillance operations across the globe - including eavesdropping on US allies. The claims have led US Senate's intelligence committee to pledge to review the way the country's biggest intelligence organisation - the National Security Agency (NSA) - undertakes surveillance. According to the leaks, what are the key methods the spy agency uses? In June, the leaked documents revealed how the NSA had backdoor access to major technology companies. The files showed the agency had access to the servers of nine internet firms, including Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo, in order to track online communication under a surveillance programme known as Prism. They claimed the project gave the NSA - along with the UK's eavesdropping station GCHQ - access to email, chat logs, stored data, voice traffic, file transfers and social networking data. However, the companies denied they had offered the agency "direct access" to their servers. Some experts have also questioned Prism's real power. Digital forensics professor Peter Sommer told the BBC such access may be more akin to a "catflap" than a "backdoor", with intelligence agencies able to tap into servers only to collect intelligence on a named target. In June, further leaked documents from GCHQ published in the Guardian revealed the UK was tapping fibre-optic cables carrying global communications and sharing the data with the NSA, its US counterpart. The documents claimed GCHQ was able to access 200 fibre-optic cables, giving it the ability to monitor up to 600 million communications every day. The information on internet and phone use was allegedly stored for up to 30 days in order for it to be sifted and analysed. GCHQ declined to comment on the claims but said its compliance with the law was "scrupulous". In October, the Italian weekly L'Espresso published claims that GCHQ and the NSA had targeted three undersea cables with terminals in Italy, intercepting commercial and military data. The three cables in Sicily were named as SeaMeWe3, SeaMeWe4 and Flag Europe-Asia. Then, at the end of October, the Washington Post published claims the NSA had hacked into fibre-optic cables and other network equipment connecting servers operated by Google and Yahoo. According to the leaks, the agency had obtained and sifted through a wide range of material, including "metadata" - which records who sent or received e-mails and when - text, audio and video, in an operation run in conjunction with British counterpart GCHQ. Google, which has a number of US and overseas data centres - consisting of thousands of miles of cables and computers stored in warehouses - has said it is now working to encrypt its cables. In October, German media reported that the US had bugged German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone for more than a decade - and that the surveillance only ended a few months ago. Der Spiegel magazine, again quoting documents leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden, suggested the US had been spying on Mrs Merkel's mobile phone since 2002. The documents quoted by the magazine claimed a US listening unit was based inside its Berlin embassy - and similar operations were replicated in 80 locations around the world. Investigative journalist Duncan Campbell explains in his blog how windowless areas on the outside of official buildings could be "radio windows". These external windows - made of a special material that does not conduct electricity - allow radio signals to pass through and reach collection and analysis equipment inside. Der Spiegel said the nature of the monitoring of Mrs Merkel's mobile phone was not clear from the leaked files. However, later reports claimed that two of the chancellors phones had been targeted - one unencrypted phone she used for party business as well as her encrypted device used for government work. According to security experts, standard mobile phone encryption systems can be vulnerable because their scrambling system is, in software terms, separate from the program used to create a message. It is possible for an eavesdropper to position themselves between the message-making software and the encryption system at either end of a conversation and see information before it is scrambled or after it is unscrambled. End-to-end encryption, now adopted by many, closes this gap by having the message-making software apply the scrambling directly. In addition, many of these systems run a closed network so messages never travel over the public internet and are only decrypted when they reach their intended recipient. How encryption systems work As well as the bugging of the chancellor's phone, there are claims the NSA has monitored millions of telephone calls made by German and French citizens along with the emails and phone calls of the presidents of Mexico and Brazil. The Guardian later reported that the NSA had monitored the phones of 35 world leaders after being given their numbers by another US government official. Again, Edward Snowden was the source of the report. Der Spiegel magazine published claims in June that the NSA had also spied on European Union offices in the US and Europe. The magazine said it had seen documents leaked by Edward Snowden showing that the US had spied on EU internal computer networks in Washington and at the 27-member bloc's UN office in New York. The files allegedly suggested that the NSA had also conducted an eavesdropping operation in a building in Brussels, where the EU Council of Ministers and the European Council were located. Then, in July, the Guardian published claims in further leaked documents that a total of 38 embassies and missions had been "targets" of US spying operations. Countries targeted included France, Italy and Greece, as well as America's non-European allies such as Japan, South Korea and India, the paper said. EU embassies and missions in New York and Washington were also said to be under surveillance. The file is said to have detailed "an extraordinary range" of spying methods used to intercept messages. They included bugs, specialised antennae and wire taps. </body>

      <title>Female genital mutilation 'alert'</title>
      <description>Nurses, midwives and GPs in the UK must be much more aware of female genital mutilation (FGM) and treat it as child abuse, says a new report.</description>

      <body>Nurses, midwives and GPs in the UK must be much more aware of female genital mutilation (FGM) and treat it as child abuse, says a report. The recommendation is among nine in a document produced by several royal colleges and health visitors' representatives. It also says female patients who have had their sexual organs cut should be referred to police and other services. The government said that the practice was "abhorrent". Genital mutilation is thought to have affected at least 66,000 women in the UK - but this is a conservative estimate. A helpline set up by the NSPCC this year received more than 100 inquiries in its first three months, resulting in 38 referrals to the police. The practice is illegal, but so far no criminal cases have been brought - though the former Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, says in a foreword to the report that "it is only a matter of time before this happens". The joint guidelines, produced by the Royal Colleges of Midwives, Nursing and Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, say health professionals should identify girls at risk of FGM as early as possible. The report reminds healthcare staff they have a legal duty to protect girls from cutting. It is thought some NHS professionals have sometimes been concerned they risk offending or stigmatising people in ethnic minority communities. And it suggests a publicity campaign to raise awareness, similar to previous campaigns about HIV and domestic violence. The report says: "Other child protection systems in the EU, such as France, have responded with systematic screening of girls under six years of age, through annual physical examinations. "Although the UK may not want to take this position, as it is viewed as too intrusive, it is important to underline the principle that in specific situations where there is a suspicion that girls have undergone FGM, it should not be seen as abusive to undertake such examinations. "Every woman from a practising community who books for maternity care should be asked in a sensitive manner about FGM, and the discussion recorded. "Girls born to mothers who have had FGM should be considered at risk of significant harm. They require monitoring through the child protection system." The report quotes the example of a service in Waltham Forest, east London, which has since closed down, in which social workers made a home visit to such families to tell them about the law on mutilation. The group found there were gaps in the responsiveness of the health and social care system in addressing FGM - and there was minimal documentation of it. The colleges also recommend that, in areas where affected communities live, schools provide time in the curriculum, and teachers and school nurses have one-to-one conversations with girls. According to Unicef, female mutilation is particularly prevalent in communities from Somalia, Egypt, Mali and Sudan. Dr Deborah Hodes, a consultant community paediatrician from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: "FGM has been illegal in the UK for more than 25 years. "In the UK, there are women who come from countries where FGM is common. Many of their children, despite being born here, are at risk of having this procedure forced upon them. "It is therefore crucial that all paediatricians have the confidence to talk to parents about the issue and the ability to recognise the signs and respond appropriately when the child is at risk." Efua Dorkenoo, an expert on FGM and a member of the human rights group Equality Now, said: "The UK is well on its way to developing a joined-up response to FGM. "However, we need to redouble our efforts to ensure that the right systems are institutionalised, that the correct data is gathered and shared, and that every frontline professional knows what action they need to take." Public Health Minister Jane Ellison said: "Female genital mutilation is illegal and we have to both safeguard girls from this form of child abuse and address the longer-term health needs of those girls and women living with FGM. "We are already working actively with the Health and Social Care Information Centre to look at how best the NHS could collect and share data and I am working hard, with colleagues across government, to protect future generations of girls from this abhorrent practice." </body>

      <title>Blood test hope for skin cancer</title>
      <description>A simple blood test could be used to identify patients whose skin cancer has spread, according to a presentation at the National Cancer Research Institute conference.</description>

      <body>A simple blood test could be used to identify patients whose skin cancer has spread, according to a presentation at the National Cancer Research Institute conference. Melanoma is particularly difficult to detect and treat once it spreads. Dundee University researchers say that measuring levels of a gene called TFP12 in DNA in the blood could be key. Cancer Research UK said the findings could lead to faster diagnoses and new treatments. Dr Tim Crook, study author and consultant medical oncologist at the University of Dundee, said detecting if melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, had started to spread was challenging. "By using a blood test, we have the basis of a simple and accurate way of discovering how advanced the disease is, as well as an early warning sign of whether it has started to spread. "This would give doctors and patients important information much sooner than is possible at the moment. "There's increasing evidence that the latest treatments are more effective in these early stages and, if we can identify patients whose cancer has only just started to spread, this would significantly improve the chances of beating the disease," Dr Crook said. Prof Charlotte Proby, a dermatologist based at the University of Dundee, said: "Using blood tests to assess the landscape of our DNA is a simple way to learn more about what's going on under the skin. "The switching on and off of certain genes seems to affect when, where and why the melanoma spreads." Prof Proby said the next step was to develop a panel of similar biomarkers that would help to detect those patients needing extra treatment to fight their melanoma. More than eight in 10 people now survive melanoma for at least 10 years, but experts say there is still more to be done for patients whose cancer has spread to other organs. Dr Harpal Kumar, chief executive of Cancer Research UK and chair of the NCRI, said the research, revealed at the conference in Liverpool, could be important. "This work could lead to quicker diagnosis and potentially new treatments, giving patients and doctors an even better chance of beating the disease," he said. The same research team identified another potential biomarker, called NT5E, which appears to be linked to spread of aggressive melanoma. The researchers say it could be a possible target for developing new treatments to tackle melanoma, particularly for cancers that have spread to the brain, lungs and other organs. </body>

      <title>Call for national dementia database</title>
      <description>A senior police officer is calling for a national dementia database to help emergency services assist people who are confused or agitated.</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-24774638</url>
      <date>1383449862</date>
      <thumbnail>http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/70855000/jpg/_70855952_dementia.jpg</thumbnail>
      <body>A police chief is calling for a national database holding the details of people suffering from dementia. Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of Greater Manchester, said it would help emergency services assist people who are either confused or agitated. "It will enable the caring agencies to give a much better service when we receive a call and decide how to treat it," Sir Peter said. The Alzheimer's Society said it could cause more problems than it solved. It is estimated there are 800,000 people in the UK who are suffering from some form of dementia, and that figure is set to rise to more than one million over the next decade. Many people with dementia live in the community rather than in care homes. Greater Manchester, one of the largest police forces in England, estimates that the equivalent of 400 of its 7,200 officers each year are deflected from traditional policing roles to deal with people who have mental health issues. Part of that mental health workload is related to people suffering from dementia. "It's a growing issue and sometimes it is because people suffering from dementia go missing, sometimes it's because they have fallen at home and they are confused and we need to gain access on behalf of the ambulance service," Sir Peter told BBC Radio 5 live Investigates. "We have some people with dementia who are ringing us 30 times a day and clearly we have to take every one of those calls seriously," he added. He said the police service needed to look at procedures which would ensure people with dementia get a better service. "One thing I would like to see is a national database where carers and the families of elderly vulnerable people can put their contact details so if the police or ambulance get a call to that particular address, they can phone that relative and immediately get some background information," Sir Peter said. "While some might see that as a threat to civil liberties and the state having too much information - in reality it will enable the caring agencies to give a much better service," he added. But the Alzheimer's Society, which campaigns for improved services for people with dementia, is wary about such a scheme. "Too many people with dementia currently go under the radar, and lose out on access to the health and social care support they need. Agencies like the police need to be able to identify people with dementia but giving them access to a national database may pose problems," George McNamara, the head of policy at the society said. "If the police and social services were to simply share existing information more effectively, this could go a significant way towards aiding the police and enabling people with dementia to live independently in their own homes," he added. Research by the BBC has shown that some police forces have seen an increase in incidents involving people with dementia. Around a quarter of forces across the UK - 14 - were able to provide figures, based on a trawl through their incident logs. All the forces that responded indicated that these incidents had risen over the last two years. Sussex Police, for example - which covers the popular retirement towns on the English south coast - saw an increase from 682 in 2010 to 1,815 in 2012. People with some rarer forms of dementia can exhibit anti-social behaviour and as a result of their symptoms, may be more likely to come into contact with the police. Angela Potter's husband was diagnosed with fronto-temporal dementia when he was 50. This form of dementia affects people's ability to reason and communicate. "His character changed and just became less inhibited. He started to shoplift. He saw things that he wanted and he just took them, he didn't understand that you have to pay. He was banned from many shops," she said. Fortunately her local community police officer in north London was sympathetic. "He met my husband and understood the situation. He was willing to listen and try and understand and I called him any time I needed to, he was always very helpful," she said. In Greater Manchester, Sir Peter said dealing with people with dementia and mental health issues can deflect officers from their more traditional roles. "Sometimes it feels like crime is an ancillary activity for us - and to some extent crime is relatively straightforward. We know what to do with a burglary or a burglar. "But often you are dealing with a complex issue involving a vulnerable person and you are struggling to get help from a medical person, and that can be a very difficult issue to solve," he added. "An officer can be tied up for five, six or seven hours at a hospital waiting for a proper assessment to be made or waiting for them to be found a bed - and that clearly is a huge use of police time, it affects police morale and absolutely affects our ability to do our primary job of reducing crime." In a statement the Department of Health said: "There are no plans to introduce a national database of dementia patients. Any decision to do so would have to be backed up by robust evidence demonstrating that it helps vulnerable people with the condition remain more independent. The choice of being included on such a database must be made by the individual and their family. "We want to ensure that people with dementia can lead as independent lives as possible. This is why schemes such as Dementia Friends, which help to raise public awareness and understanding of the condition, are so important." </body>

      <title>Poverty 'linked to cancer deaths'</title>
      <description>Hundreds of women from the poorest backgrounds in England are dying needlessly of breast cancer, according to researchers.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of women from the poorest backgrounds in England are dying needlessly of breast cancer, according to researchers. Data presented at the National Cancer Research Institute conference showed poverty was linked to 450 breast cancer deaths a year. Catching the tumour late is thought to be a major explanation for the deaths. The Department of Health said "much more" could be done to diagnose and treat cancer earlier. Cancer charities and the researchers urged women to see their GP promptly. Scientists from Cambridge and Leicester universities used data from 20,738 patients in the east of England who had breast cancer diagnosed between 2006 and 2010. They looked at what stage of the cancer the tumours were being diagnosed. The later the diagnosis, the more advanced the tumour and the harder it is to treat. Women from the most affluent areas were catching their tumours earlier, the data showed. The study found that if women from more socially deprived backgrounds could match the level of diagnosis among the more affluent, 450 lives could be saved each year in England. One of the researchers, Dr Gary Abel, of the University of Cambridge, told the BBC it was not entirely clear why poverty affected women's chances of survival. "But we think it's to do with both symptom awareness amongst the more deprived women and also what action they take once they find that there is something wrong - and how quickly they go to their GP," he said. "What we seem to see is that women from more affluent areas will go straight to their GP, seek help immediately. Whereas women from more deprived areas maybe tend to hold back before going. He called for a "renewed effort" to boost awareness campaigns, pointing out that around 70% of those with breast cancer were diagnosed by their GP - not through the national screening programme. "Clearly this research shows that there is still work to be done and perhaps we need to move beyond just telling people what the symptoms are and encouraging people to go and see their GP as quickly as possible." Dr Julie Sharp, of Cancer Research UK, said: "Other research shows that women from deprived backgrounds are more likely to feel embarrassed or worried about going to their GP, but it's important for women to take that step as going to the GP promptly could make all the difference." "All women should be aware of how their breasts normally look and feel because we know that early diagnosis is one of the most important factors in whether breast cancer treatment is effective." Eluned Hughes, head of public health at Breakthrough Breast Cancer, added: "By focusing on improving early diagnosis, particularly in deprived areas, we can have most impact in stopping women dying from breast cancer. A Department of Health spokesman said much more could be done to diagnose and treat cancer earlier. "We are spending £450 million to help diagnose cancer earlier, which will save thousands of extra lives every year, and we are investing more than £170 million over four years to expand and introduce pioneering new methods of screening for cancer. "We are also committed to reducing inequalities in cancer care - that's why our Be clear on cancer campaigns are aimed at more disadvantaged groups and try to build awareness of cancer symptoms." Previous research by Public Health England has shown a strong link between poverty and health. Cancer, heart attacks, strokes, lung disease and liver disease are all more likely in areas of social deprivation. </body>

      <title>Benefit delays 'hit cancer patients'</title>
      <description>Hundreds of terminally ill cancer patients face an "appalling" wait for their income support because of reforms to benefits, a leading charity is warning.</description>

      <body>Hundreds of terminally ill cancer patients face waiting weeks and months for their income support because of a new payments system, a leading charity has warned. Macmillan Cancer Support described the situation as "appalling". Government attempts to simplify the system mean payments that previously took eight to 10 days are now taking eight to 10 weeks, the charity said. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) questioned Macmillan's figures. A new system for disability benefit claimants was introduced in April. For the majority of claimants, Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) are replacing the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) - claimed by 3.2m people - in what ministers say is a simplification of the system. But Macmillan say early indications from their advisers working in hospitals and citizens advice bureaux are that the changes have left hundreds without support. Keith Boyd, who was diagnosed with terminal cancer in May, told the BBC the delay made him feel "like a second-class citizen". Mr Boyd said he waited three months without income after applying for support - despite his doctor saying he should be a priority. "People were telling me I was entitled to this benefit but nobody was paying it... If you had children and you were trying to survive on nothing, I don't know how you would do it." But a spokeswoman for the DWP said under the new PIPs, terminally ill cancer patients were "fast-tracked" and that under the previous system claimants had to fill in a 40-page form. She said there were no "robust statistics" to back-up Macmillan's claim that the change had caused delays for hundreds. "Macmillan aren't comparing like with like as DLA and PIP are completely different benefits with different claim processes. "[The charity has] acknowledged that improvements in the system have been made since the new benefit was introduced in April and we continue to work with them to further streamline the process." Macmillan's director of policy and research Mike Hobday told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "The principle of a fast-track process for terminally ill patients... is still there but the fact that the processing time has gone from eight-to-10 days to eight-to-10 weeks really is appalling." He said the charity was talking to DWP officials about the delays but added there was "no sign of a commitment to what the timescale should be". Claims from other terminally ill patients without cancer who qualify for the enhanced PIP rate are also "fast-tracked" and do not require a face-to-face consultation, the DWP says. Over the next few years the government is replacing DLA for 16-64 year olds with the new PIP system. </body>

      <body>The chief executive of Northern Ireland's Health and Social Care Board is to retire next year. John Compton, who has held the position since 2009, is expected to leave in March. Since taking up the post, he has been at the forefront of shaping health and social care in Northern Ireland. He is the author of Transforming Your Care, the document that set out the road map for change to the local health and social care system. Included in the document was the plan to move hospital services out into the community. More recently, Transforming Your Care also led to the controversial debate over the potential closure of care homes for older people. Earlier this year, Mr Compton was awarded the CBE in the 2013 Queen's birthday honours list. The Health and Social Care Board has paid tribute to its outgoing chief executive, saying he had given "40 years of dedicated service to health and social care in Northern Ireland". The board's chairman, Dr Ian Clements, said that during his career, Mr Compton had made a huge contribution by "driving forward change and making a difference in people's lives". "Most recently, he was the driving force behind the Transforming Your Care review which is one of the most significant reforms of health and social care in decades, aimed at ensuring Northern Ireland has safe, high quality, patient and client centred health and social care into the future." The chairman added that Mr Compton's recent CBE award was "a fitting acknowledgement of a lifetime of dedication to the health and social care of our community". Health Minister Edwin Poots said: "Through his strong leadership and his deep understanding of the issues, John Compton has written a place for himself in the history of health and social care in Northern Ireland. "Under his deft stewardship as its first chief executive, the Health and Social Care Board undertook the challenging role of delivering safe and sustainable health care services to everyone in Northern Ireland. "In 2011, he led a comprehensive review of how we deliver those health services to a growing and ageing population. "We are now following a path of reform which was originally mapped out by John and his team in Transforming Your Care," Mr Poots added. </body>

      <title>Fewer minority girls have HPV jab</title>
      <description>Girls from black and Asian ethnic minorities are less likely to have been vaccinated against cervical cancer, research suggests.</description>

      <body>Girls from black and Asian ethnic minorities are less likely to be vaccinated against cervical cancer, research suggests. In a survey by University College London of 2,000 teenagers from 13 London schools, unvaccinated girls also said they would be less likely to go for a smear test when adults. The HPV vaccine is offered to all girls aged 12-13 in schools across the UK. Girls who are not vaccinated have an increased risk of cervical cancer. Sara Hiom, Cancer Research UK's director of early diagnosis, said it was important that as many girls as possible were protected. "It's vital that girls, along with their parents, understand the importance of both these programmes, which are designed to prevent cancer from developing. "As well as cervical cancer, research has shown that HPV also increases the risk of developing other cancers, such as some types of mouth, head and neck cancers, anal cancer and other genital cancers." The HPV vaccine was introduced in the UK in 2008, with a national vaccination programme for girls in Year 8 at school. To be fully protected, girls need to receive three doses of the vaccine within six months. Cervical cancer is largely preventable through vaccination against HPV, the virus that causes it, as well as cervical screening in adulthood, which picks up any problems early. In the UCL survey, 85% of white girls said they had received the three doses, compared with 78% of Asian, 74% of "other" ethnicity and 69% of black girls. The findings, being presented at a National Cancer Research Institute conference in Liverpool, also revealed there was no link between the vaccine status of the girls who were surveyed and their level of sexual activity. Laura Marlowe, a researcher at UCL, said religious beliefs could have a part to play in the lower uptake figures for Asian girls but they could not explain the figures for the black girls. Dr Jo Waller, lead researcher at UCL, said more research was needed to find out why there was a difference between ethnic groups. "We need to understand the reasons for ethnic inequalities in uptake, as well as working to ensure that unvaccinated women understand the importance of cervical screening." Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust has carried out research into awareness of cervical cancer among ethnic minority groups and charity director Robert Music said its results showed "a clear difference in levels of knowledge about the disease and ways to prevent it". He said: "Less than half of black and minority ethnic women knew the human papillomavirus causes cervical cancer." The findings also showed that a third more black and minority ethnic than white women said they had never attended a cervical screening appointment. Around five million women are invited for cervical screening in England each year when a smear test looks for pre-cancerous changes in the cells lining the cervix. The tests are routinely offered to women aged 25 to 64. In Scotland, the age at which women are first offered a cervical screening test will be raised from 20 to 25 in 2015. From September, women in Wales are now being invited for smear tests when they reach 25. This is because research concluded that screening women under 25 was not an effective way of preventing cervical cancer. </body>

      <title>NHS apology for miscarriage error</title>
      <description>The University Hospital of Wales is forced to apologise for flaws in the way it diagnosed miscarriages over many years.</description>

      <body>A Cardiff hospital has been forced to apologise for flaws in the way it diagnosed miscarriages over many years. It follows the case of a woman wrongly told she had miscarried nine weeks into her pregnancy after a scan at the University Hospital of Wales. Emily Wheatley, from Monmouth, went on to have a healthy baby daughter, Ella. The Public Service Ombudsman for Wales believes flaws in UHW's practices may have gone back as far as 2006. A helpline has been set up for patients. Ms Wheatley was told during a dating scan she had suffered a silent miscarriage - where there are no symptoms. She chose to undergo a uterine evacuation at Nevill Hall hospital in Abergavenny, but staff there discovered she was nine weeks pregnant with a healthy foetus. Ms Wheatley suffers from polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis, meaning the chances of her conceiving naturally were "very, very slim". "To be told that I'd miscarried was a real shock," she said. "It took a lot to adjust to that after adjusting to the fact that I was pregnant in the first place." After being told she was indeed still pregnant, she said: "Even though the baby was there clearly on the screen, I couldn't really believe it." She said the hospital "took away the enjoyment of pregnancy". She added: "It's just unbelievable actually that there are potentially other women out there who have been diagnosed with having a silent miscarriage... and they potentially have got rid of healthy babies. That frightens me." "Maybe hundreds of babies have been lost because of their decision making, which is unthinkable." Peter Tyndall, Public Service Ombudsman for Wales, said it was an "unacceptable mistake" which should have been avoided and he has called a review of midwife sonographers' competency. He said staff, after discovering a silent miscarriage, should have used a different scan to give them a "more accurate picture", but failed to do so. In a report, he says the health board "failed to implement guidelines issued by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) that were designed to prevent the misdiagnosis of early pregnancy loss" and had been using out-dated guidance for two years or more. Asked how many other people could have been affected, he replied: "You'll have to ask the health board but clearly there will have been others. "The health board has set up a helpline for other women who think they may have been affected. "We'd advise them if they are concerned to contact the helpline." Mr Tyndall said he thinks Ms Wheatley's case is "unusual and I don't think it's typical", but he said other women may have been similarly affected. The ombudsman made a series of recommendations, including that the health board issues a written apology and pays the woman £1,500. The helpline - 0800 952 0244 - was launched on Friday and will remain open from 09:00 to 17:00 daily until 17:00 GMT on 4 November. Dr George Findlay, Cardiff and Vale Health Board director for children and women's services, said about 6,000 deliveries are performed each year, and between 600 and 1,200 people have a miscarriage. "We're saying that about 600 women per year may have a miscarriage that leads to an intervention by us," he said. "What I don't know right now is what type of scan or number of scans that these patients had and we're happy to look at that on a case by case basis." Dr Findlay added: "We let her down and we didn't provide a standard of care that's acceptable to me as a doctor or me as a manager." Cardiff and Vale University Health Board's executive director of nursing, Ruth Walker, offered an "unreserved" apology to Ms Wheatley and said the said the board was "genuinely sorry that it has taken an ombudsman's report for her to receive the answers she deserved". She said that correct procedures were now followed. She added the helpline had received 28 calls throughout the day on Friday. "We were able to immediately reassure eight of those patients regarding their care and will be speaking further with 10 other patients in the coming days. "There were also 10 calls from patients outside the Cardiff and Vale area which we were able to redirect accordingly." </body>

      <title>Down's pregnancy blood test trialled</title>
      <description>A blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS.</description>

      <body>A simple blood test during pregnancy which can detect Down's syndrome in the developing foetus is to be trialled by the NHS. It could significantly reduce the number of women needing invasive testing, which can cause miscarriage. The study at Great Ormond Street Hospital will assess how and when the blood test could be introduced across the NHS. In the UK, 750 babies are born with Down's syndrome each year. All pregnant women in the UK are offered screening for Down's syndrome. Currently a woman's risk is assessed, based on her age, an ultrasound scan and markers in the blood. Those deemed at high risk of a child with Down's are offered an invasive test. It involves using a needle to take a sample of either placental cells or of the fluid that bathes the baby - but this procedure carries a one-in-100 chance of miscarriage. The aim is to reduce the number of women having the invasive testing by more accurately assessing the risk. The new blood test, which is already available privately, looks for tiny fragments of DNA from the placenta and the foetus floating in the mother's bloodstream. Down's syndrome is caused by an extra copy of a massive stretch of DNA - a part or even all of chromosome 21. The test can analyse the free floating DNA for extra copies. It is thought to be 99% accurate. Those with a positive result will still be offered the invasive procedure to confirm the result. Prof Lyn Chitty, from Great Ormond Street who is leading the trial, told the BBC: "It could very significantly reduce the number of invasive tests and increase detection, this is seriously exciting stuff and it would be great to get it into the NHS. "What we are trying to do is give information on how and when to introduce it into the NHS." The NHS National Institute for Health Research funded trial will analyse the scale of the benefit and the best way to inform mothers and train staff, including midwives, about the test. "One of the very important aspects of our study is looking at ways to ensure women understand the test and the implications of the results so that they can choose whether or not to have it," she said. Dr Anne Mackie, from the UK National Screening Committee, said: "Early indications suggest that using Non-Invasive Prenatal Testing (NIPT) to screen women who are found to be at a higher risk of having a baby with Down's syndrome would enable earlier and safer detection of the condition. "[We have] been working in close collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, particularly in looking to ensure the new test does not affect the quality of the current service offered to pregnant women." Carol Boys, the chief executive of the Down's Syndrome Association said: "We would be delighted if tests which lead to miscarriage were discontinued. "We understand that the new test is approximately 99% accurate for those women who have already been established as having a high chance of carrying a baby with Down's syndrome, and are interested to see if that accuracy is maintained in women where this has not already been established. The studies for this are still under way." She said the information and education provided to women and health professionals would be important. </body>

      <title>Rabies kitten prompts French warning</title>
      <description>French authorities warn of a rabies threat after a cat dies of the disease previously thought to have been eliminated from the country.</description>

      <body>French authorities are warning of a rabies threat after a cat died of the disease, previously thought to have been eliminated from the country. The two-month-old black and tan kitten was found last Friday in Argenteuil, near Paris. It died three days later. France's Ministry of Agriculture has begun an investigation and vaccinated five people as a precaution. France was declared free of rabies in 2001 but a dog imported from Morocco infected other dogs in 2008. "It is extremely important to find all the people, particularly the owner, or any animals that have been in contact with the kitten, its mother and other kittens of the litter," the ministry said in a statement. It has set up a helpline for anyone concerned about the disease. France was first declared a rabies-free zone for non-flying terrestrial mammals 12 years ago following the elimination of fox rabies. The 2008 canine rabies outbreak led to that status being suspended for two years. The BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris said that the urgent appeal seeking anyone who came into contact with the infected animal is likely to be fuelled by fears of a repeat of the 2008 outbreak. The rabies virus is present in the saliva of an infected animal and is usually transmitted to humans by a bite. The symptoms can take two to three weeks to appear. It can be fatal if not treated, but there has been no case of rabies being contracted by humans in mainland France since 1923. The last case of rabies in the UK not involving a quarantined animal was reported in May 2012. A woman died in hospital in London after apparently being bitten by an infected dog in South Asia. </body>

      <title>Drinks tax 'would reduce obesity'</title>
      <description>A 20% tax on sugary drinks could reduce the number of obese adults in the UK by 180,000, say researchers writing in the British Medical Journal.</description>

      <body>A 20% tax on sugary drinks would reduce the number of obese adults in the UK by 180,000, say researchers writing in the British Medical Journal. The impact would be greatest in the under-30s, the Oxford and Reading university study suggests. But some groups say a tax is misguided and simplistic, and would not have an impact on older age groups who might benefit most from losing weight. Earlier this year doctors called for a soft drinks tax to reduce sugar intake. Sugar-sweetened drinks, when taken regularly, have been shown to increase the risk of obesity, diabetes and tooth decay. A typical sugary drink can contain six to 15 teaspoons of sugar. One teaspoon of sugar is equivalent to 4g of sugar or 16 calories. A 20% tax would add about 12p to the price of a 330ml can of fizzy drink bought in a supermarket or about 40p to the cost of two-litre bottle. The researchers in this study estimated that such a tax could cut drinks purchases by 15% and lead to a reduced energy intake of 28 calories per person per week. Overall, they estimated that such a tax would reduce the number of obese UK adults by 1.3% and the number of overweight adults by 0.9%. Among younger adults, aged 16-29, who drink larger quantities of sugary drinks (300ml per day) than older adults (60ml per day), the researchers predicted a reduction of 128,000 in the number of obese adults - a bigger impact than for other age groups. But Gavin Partington, director general of the British Soft Drinks Association, said soft drinks were not to blame for obesity. "There's ample evidence to suggest that taxing soft drinks won't curb obesity, not least because its causes are far more complex than this simplistic approach implies. "Indeed, the latest official guidance from the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence points to the need to look at overall diet and lifestyle. "Trying to blame one set of products is misguided, particularly when they comprise a mere 2% of calories in the average diet." Dr Adam Briggs, lead study author from the Nuffield Department of Population Health at Oxford University, said their research led them to conclude that taxing sugar-sweetened drinks "is a promising population measure". He said: "Sugar-sweetened drinks are known to be bad for health and our research indicates that a 20% tax could result in a meaningful reduction in the number of obese adults in the UK. "Such a tax is not going to solve obesity by itself, but we have shown it could be an effective public health measure and should be considered alongside other measures to tackle obesity in the UK." The study modelled the health effects of a 20% tax using data from a number of different surveys, which provided information on drinks consumption, drinks-purchasing trends and the prevalence of obesity in the four countries of the UK. Some experts, including Tom Sanders, professor of nutrition and dietetics at King's College London, felt the findings were "naive". He said: "Most nutritionists agree it would be better to drink water than sugar-sweetened beverages. However, many consumers like sweet drinks and if they could not afford to buy sugary fizzy drinks they can always revert to drinking tea with added sugar as in the past. "The cost of sugar-sweetened beverages is currently so low that any price increase would be so marginal that it would be unlikely to affect intake." In the past year, however, there have been calls for a tax on fizzy drinks from the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges and from food and farming charity Sustain. Malcolm Clark, from Sustain, said the BMJ study provided more evidence that a duty on sugary drinks would improve the diet and health of children and young people. He said the duty should cover all sugar-sweetened drinks, including those - like flavoured waters and juice drinks - that parents often don't realise have added sugar. He added: "We challenge the government to show it has a public health backbone by introducing a sugary drinks duty, alongside better protection for children from junk food marketing and robust nutrition and sustainability standards for all the food served in schools, hospitals and other publicly funded places." A spokesperson from the Department of Health said the Responsibility Deal, which a number of soft drinks companies have voluntarily signed up to pledging to reduce sugar in their drinks, was helping people to make healthier choices. </body>

      <title>Prostate cancer death rate falls</title>
      <description>The death rate from prostate cancer has fallen by 20% in the past 20 years, figures from Cancer Research UK show, although the actual number of deaths has risen.</description>

      <body>The death rate from prostate cancer has fallen by 20% in the past 20 years, figures from Cancer Research UK show. In the early 1990s there were about 30 deaths per 100,000 men but this figure has fallen to about 24 deaths per 100,000, although the number of actual deaths has increased. The charity says earlier diagnoses and new treatments such as hormone therapy and radiotherapy are behind the trend. But experts say more work needs to be done to reduce deaths from the disease. Despite the fall in death rates, the number of deaths from prostate cancer has increased because there are more men surviving to an older age (over 65 years) when prostate cancer is most common. So there were 9,500 deaths per year in the early 1990s compared with 10,800 in 2010, the latest figures available. But the rates, which show the proportion of the UK population dying of prostate cancer each year, have fallen. Between 1990-92 and 2008-10, death rates decreased by 21% in men aged 45 to 54 years, 25% in 55 to 64-year-olds, 29% in 65 to 74-year-olds and 25% in 75 to 84-year-olds. But for men aged 85 and over the overall rate increased by 2%. This could be because men in this age group are less likely to receive radical treatment. Prof Malcolm Mason, a prostate cancer expert based at Cardiff University, said although treatments were improving, there was much researchers still had to find out. "We still don't understand why some prostate cancers turn out be harmless - the grass snakes - while others are aggressive - the vipers - and resistant to treatment. Developing a test that distinguishes between these grass snakes and vipers in prostate cancer patients would help doctors understand which patients are most at risk." Each year about 41,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Prostate cancer typically affects elderly men, causing obstruction to the neck of the bladder and impairing urination. Martin Ledwick, head information nurse at CRUK, said: "The symptoms for prostate cancer are similar to a number of benign and harmless conditions but it's worth being aware of them and getting anything unusual checked out with your GP. "Things such as having to rush to the toilet to pass urine and difficulty urinating should be checked out, especially if it's getting you up several times during the night." He also said prostate cancer was more common in anyone who had a relative diagnosed with the disease and men of African-Caribbean descent. Prostate Cancer UK chief executive Owen Sharp said 10,000 men dying each year from the disease was a "shocking" statistic, equivalent to more than one man every hour. "The raw truth is that there are simply too few options for men with advanced prostate cancer and even life-saving treatments for less aggressive cancers can have life-changing side effects." </body>

      <body>A heart surgeon at a Swansea hospital has won an award for an invention that cost him 95p to create. Morriston hospital doctor Abdullrazak Hossien made his surgery training simulator out of a sweet tin. The portable device can be used anywhere and is now being manufactured for use around the world. It is used in training for surgery of the aortic root, which carries blood from the left side of the heart to the arteries of the limbs and organs. Dr Hossien created his training device for a competition run as part of the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery (EACTS) Conference 2013 in Vienna. He said: "Thomas Edison said that to invent you need a good imagination and a pile of junk. "I designed a portable trainer, which you can keep in your pocket. You can practise on the train, on an aeroplane, at home, wherever you are. "I developed it from a sweet tin that can be fixed to a table, and created an aorta using synthetic material. It cost me around 95p. "I accompanied this simulator with a multimedia DVD [with] guidelines that trainees can apply to any procedure on the aortic root. They can progress from the simplest procedure to the most complex as they develop." Dr Hossien said trainees using the simulator would be completely familiar with the procedures by the time they came to carry out supervised aortic root surgery on patients. He added: "They will have mastered the procedure before they operate on the patient." Dr Hossien said that at the same time "qualified surgeons and any doctor with an interest in the specialty can improve their skills". For the EACTS award, candidates were challenged to create a low-tech training simulator for aortic root surgery. These were judged by a panel of eight top surgeons from Europe and the USA. Dr Hossien was eventually declared joint winner along with a candidate from Italy. His simulator will be manufactured for worldwide use by award sponsor Ethicon, which develops innovative surgical products. Dr Hossien turned the garage of his Swansea home into a workshop to develop the aortic root simulator. "I spent six or seven months on it. I would forget to eat and to drink sometimes because I was thinking about it so much. "I would like to thank my wife and daughter who supported me and gave me the time I needed to develop this." He is donating his share of the 3,000 euro (£2,600) first prize from the EACTS award to the Syrian humanitarian relief appeal. Dr Hossien is senior clinical research fellow in the cardiothoracic department at Morriston Hospital. Mr Saeed Ashraf, consultant cardiothoracic surgeon and honorary senior lecturer at Swansea University said: "Dr Hossien is a very talented academic surgeon with an excellent pair of surgical hands." </body>

      <body>A Scottish health board has uploaded a short film to video sharing website YouTube in a bid to recruit new staff. The video promoting vacancies in NHS Highland's cancer treatment services is the first in a series the board plans to produce to attract new employees. In the six-minute film, workers seek to dismiss misconceptions about the Highlands. Last month, NHS Highland was unsuccessful in a second attempt to fill seven GP vacancies. In the YouTube film, several members of staff talk about what the health board and the Highlands have to offer. They say Inverness's Raigmore Hospital, which has a vacancy for a consultant oncologist, has cutting edge technology to match larger city hospitals. Raigmore has also led the way in the use of image guided radiotherapy, staff point out during the film. The employees have also sought to dispel mistaken ideas about the region. Steve Colligan, head of radiotherapy physics, says: "I think people do believe the Highlands is a bit backwards and not up-to-date and I think it's important to reassure everyone that we have running water and electricity." Dr Carol MacGregor, a Macmillan consultant in clinical oncology, adds that the area offers a wide range of activities that do not involve "Gortex and wellies". The Scottish government has supported the use of video to help attract potential recruits to NHS Highland. Health Secretary Alex Neil said: "I am acutely conscious of the challenges we all face in providing high quality, sustainable healthcare - particularly for those who live in remote and rural communities." He added: "Initiatives such as this film produced by NHS Highland will help to promote the benefits of living and working in Highland." The closing date for applications to the consultant oncologist post is next month. NHS Highland has been facing challenges in recruiting staff to some posts. A renewed effort to fill seven GP vacancies in a remote part of the Highlands was unsuccessful, it emerged last month. NHS Highland re-advertised the posts in the sparsely populated area of West Lochaber after a first round of adverts failed to attract enough applicants. The health board had hoped a new plan for a cluster of local practices would have allayed potential applicants' concerns about having to work alone. But not enough people have come forward to staff that model of cover. The GPs are needed to cover places such as Arisaig, Acharacle and Strontian. </body>

      <title>Is 'addiction' an excuse to overeat?</title>
      <description>Expert argues "food addiction" may just be an excuse to overeat</description>

      <body>"Food addiction" is becoming a popular term to explain overeating. But in this Scrubbing Up, Professor John Blundell from the Institute of Psychological Sciences at the University of Leeds warns the term is being used far too freely. Some have likened food addiction to drug addiction, and then used this term to associate it with overeating, and as a clinical explanation for the obesity epidemic, implicating millions of people. The use of the term food addiction is a step towards medicalisation and implies that normal human social behaviour is pathological. Forms of eating therefore become an illness. This attitude is not helpful and has huge implications for the way in which people view their own behaviour and their lives. The concept of food addiction comes from a combination of experimental data, anecdotal observations, scientific claims, personal opinions, deductions and beliefs. It is an over-simplification of a very complex set of behaviours. The existing evidence fails to define the precise characteristics of the actual foods concerned or the eating environment that underlies the assumed addiction risk. This is in contrast to drug addiction, where the molecule is identified and its pharmacological effect on the brain is characterised. Animal studies have shown changes to specific brain regions in those given a sugary diet - and human brain scans show activation of reward systems in the same part of the brain when sweet tastes are consumed. Therefore, it is not surprising that reward centres are activated when sweet foods are consumed, as we know that the reward circuits in the brain have been established through evolution as signalling systems that control our appetite. Many stimuli influence these areas of the brain and, in addition, there is an intrinsic drive to consume carbohydrate-rich foods to satisfy a basic metabolic need of the brain. Sweetness is a major signal for such foods but the science has not yet assessed this fully and much more work is needed before we could say that food is addictive. Attributing food addiction as the single cause underlying the development of obesity, despite the existence of numerous other very plausible explanations, is unhelpful, particularly for those trying to live more healthy lives. I am concerned that many people may potentially latch on to the concept of food addiction as an excuse to explain their overeating - the premise that it's "not my fault" and therefore, "I can't help it". This removes the personal responsibility they should feel and could act on - and they infer that their eating is a form of disease. Food addiction may offer an appealing explanation for some people but the concept could seriously hinder an individual's capacity for personal control. Binge eating disorder does exist - but it is a rare clinical condition affecting fewer than 3% of obese people. Sufferers have a strong compulsion to eat, which persists alongside the sense of a loss of control. Addiction-like food behaviour may be a component of the severe and compulsive form of binge eating disorder. But this condition does not explain the huge rise in obesity we have seen across the population. Binge eating is not a key cause of obesity and, therefore, in the context of mass public health, is not a major concern. What we need is a calm and composed analysis of what the words food addiction really mean so that people can make informed deductions about the causes of their own behaviour. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder and would like to speak with someone about it, you could contact the charity beat on 08456341414. </body>

      <description>Two doctors attack conventional medical equipment with power tools</description>

      <body>Archimedes did it in the bath, Tesla with a walking stick and the father of the sticky note had his flash of inspiration while singing in church - or so legend has it. Yet today we expect new inventions to be born in anonymous laboratories after the submission of several grant proposals. But the age of the home-grown inventor may not be over. David Williams and John Dingley are consultant anaesthetists at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Their moment of genius came in their garages while tinkering with glue-guns and car-body filler. Inspired by Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio, they wondered "almost jokingly" whether it might be possible to make something similarly economical and easy-to-use in the medical world. And having worked in remote settings, Dr Williams was aware of how crucial equipment that does not require a constant power source could be. In Zambia he had noticed entire operating theatres remaining unused because of a lack of replacement light bulbs or a reliable mains power supply. So the doctors set themselves the challenge of inventing essential kit for the doctor's bag on a budget. And after a week spent attacking conventional medical equipment with power tools, they had the first prototype of a device which has the potential to save lives. The ShakerScope is a light source which can be quickly adapted to look in people's eyes, ears and throats. But unlike regular devices it does not need batteries. Dr Patrick Finlay, of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers said: "According to the World Health Organisation, 95% of medical devices fail to work in developing countries. Often designers in the West don't understand the conditions elsewhere. "This type of invention is very important. With these scopes you would normally need three different instruments for each examination, each one requiring batteries. For low income countries this is a joke. " At the core of the ShakerScope is a powerful moveable magnet, surrounded by a coil of wire. As noted by Michael Faraday in 1831, as the magnet moves over the wire the magnetic field induces an electric current in the coil. And shaking the ShakerScope for 30 seconds produces enough current to light the device for three minutes. "That might not sound like long but it is more than enough time for most ear or eye examinations or to insert tracheal tubes," Dr Williams said. Once the scope is shaken the charge can be stored for many weeks. And instead of using a conventional light bulb, it uses a light emitting diode which can last up to 10,000 hours. The team has designed changeable heads allowing it be converted into a number of devices. One of its most promising uses so far has been as a laryngoscope - an instrument which lights-up the back of the mouth allowing anaesthetists to insert breathing tubes when people are unable to breathe for themselves. It has already been tested in military hospitals in Afghanistan, in Uganda and after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. "In Haiti we saw a lady with a neck injury who urgently needed a tracheal tube to help stabilise her. There were no other functioning laryngoscopes close by and the ShakerScope worked well despite the difficult case," said Dr Williams. According to Dr Williams the project has been a series of steep learning curves. "Having the good idea is the easy part. Making it into a reality required an almost obsessive degree of dedication," he said. In the early days the doctors tried to do as much as possible from home - from teaching themselves microelectronics to perfecting their computer-aided design skills. Luckily for Dr Williams, his wife is a sculptor who works on large pieces of metal. He has been known to borrow her workshop, saws and glue-gun on many occasions. But he says he learned very early on that the kitchen may not be the best place to melt plastics. Dr Jerry Nolan, a consultant anaesthetist at Bath Royal United NHS Trust, who was not involved in the research said: "The ShakerScope has the potential to be invaluable in remote locations. "That they have taught themselves the skills to get a final version near to market is even more remarkable and surely disproves the adage doctors make poor businessmen." The device is one of many frugal, home-grown devices recently showcased at the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in the UK. Having made several fully-functioning versions tested across the world, the doctors say they recently reached the limit of their technical abilities, and passed on further manufacturing and design to a larger company. But these anaesthetists have returned to their sheds and have many other possible irons in the fire. </body>

      <title>The bully in the next bedroom</title>
      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063</url>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <title>'I wish IVF had never been invented'</title>
      <description>Readers' stories about their experience</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24725655</url>
      <date>1383558739</date>

      <body>A recent Magazine article by Lisa Jardine about the frequency with which In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) fails prompted readers to send in their own experiences. Five million babies have been born worldwide since 1978 thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, said Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), in the article. Fertility problems are estimated to affect one in six or one in seven couples in the UK - approximately 3.5 million people . Around 60,000 fertility treatments are performed in UK licensed clinics per year, with the live birth rate after IVF about a quarter, according to latest figures (2010) from the HFEA. The latest HFEA figures show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients under the age of the 35 will be successful. And the percentages decrease as women get older. Moreover, costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics Here are some of our readers' experiences with IVF. Karen, Blackpool: I knew about my fertility issue as a teen and met my husband when I was 31 and living and working in France. We put our names down on the waiting list as soon as we could at a French hospital. As I had contributed to the French social security system, we did not have to pay for the treatment. However, we did have to wait four years and I was therefore 36 when I started treatment, by which time we had returned to the UK. Four donor embryos and nothing but empty arms. This treatment gave us nothing but false hope when we could have spent energy on other things at an earlier stage. Of course, you only get to hear the success stories. Thurstan, Farnborough: My wife and I are going through our second round of IVF after the first one didn't work. We got through to the very end successfully, but the final result did not happen. We have to pay for our treatment, yet if we lived five miles in a different direction we would have got it free. We are told the success rate - for us its 25% to 30% - and you do live on hope. It is absolutely crushing to find out it has not worked and nobody can tell you why. Another £6,000 down the drain and you are left with a devastated feeling. Joanna, UK: At 27 I was diagnosed with Turner syndrome, and then with signs of premature ovarian failure - with a three-year time limit for most women with my condition. The technology used in assisted reproductive techniques is ever changing. If we were to wait even just a year, our chances of success would potentially increase. But waiting wasn't an option for us. Without a crystal ball to see how technology will evolve, you're forced into an emotional "now or never" scenario. The first thing we did as a couple was to decide how many IVF attempts to make. We agreed three - the first ending in yet another miscarriage, the second ending in no viable embryos. The second round was by far the worst outcome. Sitting in the clinic car park having arrived a little early, we got a phone call telling us not to come in for what was our embryo transfer appointment, because there was nothing to transfer. No viable embryo. We didn't have the energy to go in for the testing results, we just went home. Even now, putting that into words is horribly difficult and not without pain. Awash with the IVF drugs, which are hormonally altering, you just can't trust yourself to be at your best to make major life decisions. A game plan becomes a must. Had we not decided upon a game plan, I think we would have become addicted to IVF and its offering of hope. Having a game plan was also necessary to make sure we were on the same page. It's a strain within a marriage, but we were fortunate. It's really a gamble. We've all heard the expression "that floored me'". The phone call that caused my knees to buckle, I crumpled in a heap of disbelief and tearful, shaking joy. That's the hope people are offered. J, Cumbria: I'm just about to start my second round of IVF, and as mad as it sounds I wish it wasn't available/invented. It gives you hope and you pray you are one of the lucky ones. It feels like a raffle - how many tickets do you buy? Gemma, Liverpool: At 29, having found out my fallopian tubes were blocked, I started IVF treatment only for it to result in a failure. We had been trying for nearly three years with one miscarriage, devastation and despair to show for it. It felt like we had to wait ages for the referral to the fertility centre, but in reality it was only about three months as I'd had a confirmed diagnosis. We were informed that despite the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) stating that we should have three rounds of IVF, our primary care trust only funded two cycles. Straight away you feel under incredible pressure for it to work, as IVF can cost thousands of pounds at a private clinic - there is the worry of where you'd find the money (I work in the NHS, while my husband is a teacher). Arranging time off work, the endless appointments and the invasive treatment you go through in the hope that you'll get your dreamed for family out of it. It gave us hope that despite there being an issue with me, we might be able to have a family. Out of nine eggs, we only got four which fertilised normally, one was transferred and one was frozen. After the dread of a two-week wait, we found out that it was unsuccessful. I'd joined a support group and other women were announcing that their treatment was successful. It's horrible feeling guilty that you wish it was you experiencing joy rather than that woman, although you're so pleased they've been successful. We waited for months for a follow-up appointment, and it was decided that an operation was now my best option, with the possibility of removing my tubes - a scary prospect for any woman, but even worse when you know that's it - take them away and you've literally got no chance of falling pregnant naturally. Add in an extra wait for my operation, and by the time it came round I was a wreck. Amazingly, I didn't have to have my tubes removed. We were given the further hope that we might be able to conceive naturally, but if it didn't occur within a few months, there was still the frozen embryo. Imagine our surprise when four weeks after my operation my period was late. I'm now six months pregnant, and I still can't believe it, it still feels like a dream. Donna, UK: Several years ago, my husband and I embarked on consultations and investigations, then minor operations and IVF to be able to conceive. We had no choice but to go privately - at 34, I was the wrong age to get IVF on the NHS in our area. Having had the initial consultations and started a course of treatment we were told that IVF was not going to help us at all. In a way, we were lucky as our clinic was honest with us and did not try to "sell" us any more treatments or give us false hope - we had only spent £500. This enabled us to cope with the "loss" more easily at this early stage. Our expectations were well managed by our clinic, although I understand that this is not always the case. We have since gone on to adopt a beautiful boy who has made our family complete for the past three and a half years. I hated the invasive nature of IVF, and although I am glad we tried, I would never turn back the clock. We are financially secure now and would have had no savings for a rainy day if we had continued down the route of IVF. Beth, Sussex: Having been through IVF four times, I can honestly say that all these clinics are after is your money. I've never received a phone call or letter after a failed cycle. In fact, the last clinic in Brighton thought we had miscarried but my twins are now six months old. The clinic made no effort to contact us. It's shocking. Zoe, Bristol: I honestly believe that undergoing fertility treatment was the worst decision I have ever made. Before, I couldn't get pregnant because of a combined problem - I have polycystic ovaries and my husband has blocked tubes as a direct result of surgery as a baby - it was nobody's fault. I was 27 when we were referred, 28 when we first went to the clinic and 34 when we had treatment on the NHS. I was offered treatment again when I was 37, but couldn't go through with it. We needed a sperm donor just at the time the law changed on donor anonymity and the sperm banks ran dry - literally! I wrote letters and lobbied everyone we could think of to get treatment (at the time, there was no sperm for private patients either) and after two years our clinic managed to secure us sperm for three attempts. They all failed and in hindsight, I now know they had very little chance of success - funding meant we were offered a less superior form of treatment (and consequently a lower success rate - just 8%) and the clinic also made mistakes with our treatment regime. The pressure to go private was huge because the clinic couldn't offer the treatment we needed - they felt that the best option for us was private treatment and made this clear from the outset, but we couldn't afford it. At the age of 37, I discovered the clinic was able to offer ICSI (intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection) on the NHS, but I no longer met the criteria as my BMI was above 30. (If we had been private patients, BMI wouldn't have mattered). We were told from the outset about the failure rate and at every subsequent appointment. At times it felt that the clinic was only focused on the failure rate. The clinic counsellor only wanted to talk about failure which I felt was inappropriate in the middle of a cycle, whereas if I mentioned failure to the nursing staff, they always brushed it under the carpet, encouraging positive thinking instead. There was a lot of conflicting information - they would be happy to ram failure rates down your throat, but if you mentioned it, it was often glossed over. In the reception area there was a photo board of babies belonging to all the families who had had successful treatment - there was no mention of the other side. They didn't like it if I cried either - I was once told off for "snivelling" by one of the doctors. Undergoing treatment was difficult, but coming to terms with failure was much harder. Now the failure to get pregnant was purely my fault, something the clinic was very keen to reinforce - I was overweight, I had produced too many eggs, I hadn't taken my drugs correctly. Three times my body was fooled into thinking I was pregnant when no baby existed and I feel like I've had multiple miscarriages, except I haven't. I feel like I've lost a child, except I haven't. When people ask me about the worst part of infertility, I tell them it's the silence - they take that to mean that nobody talks about it and that is partly true, but for me, it's the silence which comes from the isolation and the lost friends who have moved on and had children. I no longer have anything in common with my peers. My mother-in-law recently told me that life goes on and it does go on around me, but life also stops with me - where there are no children, there are no grandchildren, no-one to care in later life, no legacy and that is silence which terrifies me. Fred, Whitby: There are unacceptable variations in the success rates of IVF. Living in one of the few areas of the country where IVF is not available on the NHS, we were forced to go private. Our options ranged from 17% at one local hospital, to 65% in a London clinic. We weighed up the options and, despite the significant extra cost and inconvenience, went for the London clinic. We knew we could only afford one cycle, but also that we didn't want to keep trying and failing. The difference was that it was in their interests to make sure everything was perfect before going ahead with the various procedures, as their success rates are their best advertisement. The local hospitals seem happy to press ahead, even when the body is not in its best condition to accept an embryo. Happily, we now have an amazing little boy. Karen, Cambridge: My husband and I went through five unsuccessful IVF treatments, and I have to say this was the worst period of my life. The drugs make you feel awful, it costs a fortune and the grief is overwhelming. All this happens in private, too, trying to carry on like nothing is happening. I went through an NHS hospital and two private hospitals and found very little compassion - we were just on a conveyor belt. We were told it was just "unexplained", but if we had been advised on more tests that were available earlier, we may have found a solution before it was too late. No doubt you will receive lots of nasty comments from people saying we should just adopt, or there are too many people in the world anyway - these usually come from people who haven't had to face that decision themselves and haven't really thought about what it means. Changes in the adoption process are, however, starting to make that a more viable option. Diane, York: I think it's quite naive to think that couples who embark on IVF don't know the odds of success. By the time they reach the decision of going down this route, they already know their chances are low. My husband and I certainly did. However, for us, it was a case of not looking back in 30 to 40 years' time, and saying that we wished we had at least tried. We were lucky, we are very proud parents of a lovely little boy at our third attempt, and we don't regret what we went through for one moment.

      <body>Amid the beeping of heart monitors, a more gentle noise can be heard on the wards of Great Ormond Street Hospital. The soft voice of musician Nick Pickett and the strumming of his guitar are entertaining the young patients in Bear Ward. All the children here are under three years old. Some are facing the long wait for a heart transplant and are being kept alive by the rhythmic beating of a mechanical heart. Sam Wallace's bed is surrounded by balloons, toys and other reminders of home. His grandmother, Viv Green, says the music has a transformative effect. "Oh, Sammy loves music, he has always loved music. "It just makes him happy. He will sing and dance. He loves to dance, he moves with the music as soon as he hears it and it just brightens him up completely - he's a different boy." But is the bedside entertainment having a clinical benefit on children such as Sam? Can a rendition of Twinkle Twinkle Little Star actually help patients? A team at the hospital and University of Roehampton tried to find out. Thirty-seven children were played songs - including Five Little Ducks, See-Saw Marjorie Daw and Hush-a-Bye Baby - while nurses monitored their heart rates and assessed their pain levels. The impact of the music was compared with storytelling or just leaving a child alone. The results, published in the journal Psychology of Music, showed only music was reducing pain, slowing heart rates and improving the children's moods. "It varies from child to child. Not every child wants to have music but for those that opt to have music I think it's very important for them," said Dr Pickett. He added: "I think the most rewarding thing is if you are working with a child that is very distressed, a little one, and you go in, play some live calming, quiet music and watch the child go to sleep, that is great, it's the best reward." One of the study's authors, David Hargreaves, of Roehampton University, is a jazz pianist as well as professor of music psychology. As he sits playing a jazz interpretation of My Funny Valentine, he says the piece calms him down and makes him happy. He says that kind of connection with music is shared even by young children: "Lullabies are something that children are familiar with. They're intended by parents to be used with their children to create relaxation and remove tension." But is this just providing some evidence for what a lot of parents have realised for a long time, that singing to their children can soothe them? The earliest records of lullabies can be traced to Babylonian times. "I think it goes a bit further," he said. "We are beginning to work out what aspects of the music affects what aspects of the physical and psychological response. "Music has an effect on our thinking, our social behaviour, our emotions and our physical responses of course. What we are saying here is that children's wellbeing - their levels of anxiety and relaxation - are mediated by the emotion that the music causes." The brain has a complicated relationship with music. It is something Prof Tim Griffiths, a consultant neurologist with the Wellcome Trust and Newcastle University, has spent a career looking at. He says the brain is analysing the musical melodies and separately responding emotionally. "There are two parts to the musical brain. There is a part which processes sound patterns in the cortex and then there's a more ancient part of the brain which is responsible for the emotional responses to music." It is a process that he says begins in the womb, so he was not surprised that children can benefit from music: "What I think is happening here is that the emotional part of the brain is being stimulated by the music more so than the reading, and this is decreasing the arousal level of the children, and that in turn is affecting their pain response levels." The academic team admit their research is at an early stage, but are convinced music could end up playing a much bigger role in hospitals. </body>

      <title>Four babies by two surrogates</title>
      <description>The couple having four babies by two surrogates</description>

      <body>A British couple are to become parents of two sets of twin babies carried by two Indian surrogate women they have never met. Experts say twiblings - or children born to separate surrogates but created from the same batch of embryos - are not uncommon in India. The four babies, all due in March 2014, are the result of a commercial surrogacy agreement with a clinic in the Indian city of Mumbai. The husband, aged 35 and wife, aged 36, who do not want to be identified, travelled to India in May following two miscarriages and several failed attempts at fertility treatment in the UK. "I thought to myself why wait and why waste any time and go through ups and downs and attempts again. We've had a long ten-year journey with this," he says. There are no official figures, but Natalie Gamble, a lawyer who specialises in international surrogacy cases, estimates hundreds of British couples travel to India for surrogacy each year. At the Corion clinic in Mumbai, the couple's eggs and sperm were fertilised to create embryos, which were then implanted in two different surrogates to increase the chances of a pregnancy. "We had six embryos in the fridge and typically you would use one surrogate, but I thought get me two surrogates and implant three in each," says the husband. A month later the clinic called with the news that one of the surrogates was pregnant with twins. They were both overjoyed. Days later there was another call from the clinic. "They found two heartbeats in the second surrogate," says the wife. "The clinic was panicking because it's never happened before," she says. "They asked us - is this what you want? Otherwise tell us now and we'll do the necessary." However, the couple say there was never any question of terminating any of the pregnancies. "Absolutely not, if there were three in each we would have had them." In a few months' time they hope to return to India to pick up their four babies. They will not disclose how much they have paid the clinic, however, a surrogacy package in India, on average costs from £17,000 ($27,500) to £20,000 ($32,500). They are grateful to the two women carrying their babies, but insist they have no intention of meeting either surrogate. "She's doing a job for us, how often do you communicate with your builder or your gardener?" "She'll get paid…we don't need to see her. As long as she's healthy and delivers my babies healthily, she's done a job for us," says the wife. Neither is daunted by the challenge of having four babies and both are confident they will be able to financially provide for them. For the professional couple from Bedfordshire, it is nothing short of an "amazing miracle". "For me to have four children, it's going to be the same challenge as the next person having one child. I don't know any different, I'm over the moon, I can't wait," says the woman. However, the case has raised concerns among health professionals in Britain. "It is troubling," says Dr Rima Rajkhowa, a consultant gynaecologist at Birmingham Women's Hospital. "I think patients who don't work in the medical field are not aware of all the risks that are involved with multiple pregnancies. All they can think of and are focused on is having a child and they want to make sure every step is taken to get to that goal." "I don't think any clinic in the UK will consider treating a commissioning couple with two surrogates simultaneously." It is a view shared by lawyer Natalie Gamble. "It wouldn't be allowed here. Under the regulation of licensed fertility clinics, there are quite strict rules about how many embryos can be transferred and certainly you couldn't transfer embryos to two surrogates in the same cycle," she says. The UK's regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), says that multiple pregnancy can increase the risk of stillbirth, neonatal death and disability for the child and complications for the mother including late miscarriage, high blood pressure and pre-eclampsia. They recommend single embryo transfer always be performed, unless there is a medical reason to transfer more than one embryo. But how common is it for fertility clinics in India - a country where there are no laws governing surrogacy - to offer patients two or more surrogates at a time? Dr Kaushal Kadam, medical director of the Corion clinic, which treated the British couple now expecting four babies, insists it is not common practice. "It's usually a single surrogate but there are times when the couple want more," she says. But is it really that unusual? Several couples who have had babies as a result of surrogacy in India have said clinics offered them the opportunity of using more than one surrogate per cycle. Lawyer Natalie Gamble confirms there are similar cases but she believes it is a trend which is largely unique to the sub-continent. "We've seen it a few times. I wouldn't say it's routine but it's not massively uncommon in India," she says. In fact there is even a new term coined for these babies - twiblings. "They're not quite twins and not quite siblings either," she says. Medical experts believe twiblings represent a fertility phenomenon which has emerged as a direct result of India's estimated billion dollar surrogacy industry, an industry which critics say is driven by profit. Surrogacy in the UK is a legal and ethical minefield. There are strict laws governing it and commercial surrogacy is banned. Meanwhile, the Indian government is under increasing pressure to introduce laws to regulate the surrogacy industry.

      <body>Skunk is the strong form of cannabis, high in the chemical THC, which has become increasingly popular with UK drug users. The drug is known to increase the risk of anxiety and paranoia amongst those who smoke it, resulting in an increasing number of referrals for mental health treatment. The number of people in treatment for mental health problems after smoking cannabis has gone up by a third in the past six years in the UK. David Manley from the Nottinghamshire Health Care NHS Trust says it is not unusual for him to meet young people who smoke 20-30 skunk joints each day. Peter Moyes, director of the Nottingham Crime and Drugs Partnership, wants a clearer message about the health dangers associated with skunk to be given to young people. Inside Out's Sarah Sturdey meets two young adults called Jackson, 18, and Jacob, 20, from Nottingham who explain why they smoke skunk despite the warnings. Inside Out is broadcast on Monday, 28 October at 19:30 GMT on BBC One East Midlands and nationwide on the iPlayer for seven days thereafter. </body>

      <body>As food retailers and manufacturers sign a pledge to cut saturated fat levels in their products, how much do you know about the different types of fat in your diet? Apart from saturated fat, others found naturally and artificially in food are unsaturated fat and trans fats. Not all fat is bad - a little in your diet helps the body absorb certain nutrients. And fat can be a source of energy, also providing essential fatty acids and some vitamins - such as vitamins A and D. So which fats should you be eating more of and which should you look to reduce? According to NHS Choices - an online healthcare advice service - cutting down on foods that are high in saturated fat is important as part of a healthy diet. Such foods include, butter, lard, chocolate, cakes, pastries and meat products, including sausages and pies. Most people eat too much saturated fat: around 20% more than the recommended maximum, studies by the British Dietetic Association say. Current Department of Health daily recommendations say the average man should eat no more than 30g of saturated fat a day, while the average woman should eat no more than 20g a day. A diet high in saturated fat can increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (otherwise known as bad cholesterol) in blood over time, increasing the risk of heart disease. But that risk has recently been disputed. Writing in the British Medical Journal, cardiologist Dr Aseem Malhotra says saturated fat has been "demonised for decades" with any link to heart disease not fully supported by scientific evidence. He says the food industry has compensated for lowering saturated fat levels by replacing them with sugar. Eating a diet of unsaturated fats can help lower bad cholesterol levels in the blood and increase levels of high-density lipoproteins (known as good cholesterol). Saturated fats can be replaced in a balanced diet with these healthier monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, which are found in many of foods, including: Oily fish provides omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, the richest source of that particular type. Omega-3 oils can help lower blood triglyceride levels, prevent blood from clotting and maintain a regular heart rhythm. The British Heart Foundation says we should aim to eat two portions of fish a week, one of which should be oily. It also recommends a small amount of monounsaturated fats to help maintain healthy cholesterol levels. The third type of fat that can be found in the diet, is trans fats. Natural trans fats are found at low levels in some foods, including meat and dairy products. Artificial trans fats are made when oil goes through a process of hydrogenation, known as hydrogenated fat. It can be used for frying. Artificial trans fats can also be found in some processed foods, such as biscuits and cakes, and are sometimes used to give products a longer shelf life. A diet high in trans fats can also lead to high levels of bad cholesterol in the blood, but most people in the UK do not eat a lot of trans fats. On average, we eat about half the recommended maximum. Most UK supermarkets have removed hydrogenated vegetable oil from their products. NHS Choices says we eat a lot more saturated fats than trans fats, but says reducing the amount of saturated fat is more important than reducing the amount of trans fats.

      <body>Five million babies have been born thanks to IVF. But few people talk of the many more times the treatment doesn't work, says Lisa Jardine, the departing chair of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Modern medicine can achieve extraordinary feats in repairing and protecting the human body, from hip replacements to life-extending cancer treatments. But for most of us, I think, there are two areas of medical intervention that have a very special status and deserve the closest ethical attention: birth and death, the creation of life and its termination. Just such close scrutiny was given to an amazing breakthrough in the treatment of infertility - the birth of the first "test tube baby", Louise Brown, in Oldham in 1978. As further successful IVF births followed, it was quickly decided by the British government that some sort of ethical and legal oversight was needed. Treating infertility by combining egg and sperm outside the womb, and then replacing the resulting embryo in the mother, was an established clinical reality. The question was, is it ethically acceptable to carry out the procedure, and what limitations and controls should be placed upon it to satisfy public concern? In summer 1984, the report of the Committee of Inquiry into Human Fertilisation and Embryology - the Warnock Report - was published. The task of the committee had been "to examine the social, ethical and legal implications of recent, and potential developments in the field of human assisted reproduction". The report highlighted the "special status" of the human embryo, and proposed the establishment of a regulator. The legislation derived from the report continues to govern In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) in the UK 30 years later under that regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, or HFEA. PDF download The Warnock Report[770KB] Dame Mary Warnock - now Baroness Warnock - turned out to be the ideal person to steer the public moral debate on IVF. As commentator Andrew Brown wrote in 2003: "Her distrust of grand schemes and theories [made] her much in demand as a kind of philosophical plumber to the establishment - whenever some tricky problem arose, she could be trusted to get things flowing again." Born into an old-fashioned, well-to-do family, Warnock studied Classics at Oxford, and became a lecturer in philosophy at St Hugh's College in 1949. Turning her attention to schooling after the birth of her five children, she became head of Oxford High School in 1966, and spent six years championing girls' secondary education. In the 1970s, she moved into public life and began to demonstrate her considerable skills as a committee chair capable of dealing with tricky political and ethical issues. She chaired a Home Office Commission of Inquiry into the use of animals in laboratory experiments, and a government commission on the education of children with special needs. Her clear-headedness and keen intellect helped dissect the issue and structure the agenda in whatever controversial arena she engaged in. These talents were complemented by her administrative skill, and her shrewd grasp of politics. She knew which recommendations would work administratively while being politically workable too. Even she probably did not anticipate the furore the Warnock Report would cause. There was opposition from religious figures, politicians and the general public to the very practice of this way of creating new life. It is a real tribute to the care with which the report was written that eventually legislation to regulate IVF went on to the statute book, and the regulatory body to oversee it - the HFEA - was set up. "Perhaps the greatest achievement of the Warnock committee is that it managed to get an ethical consensus that people understood as well as shared," observed a former HFEA chair. The results of Warnock's astuteness are to be seen in the formal structure of the HFEA as established in 1990. It must have expert medical and scientific representation, she advised, but it ought to be led by a lay chair - someone with strong ethical beliefs, but outside the IVF sector. Each of its decision-making committees should also have a lay majority. I have served as chair of the HFEA for the past six years. Next month will be my last authority meeting. So it seems an appropriate moment to reflect on my experience in that role. I have seen at first hand how the regulation of IVF uses the most elegant features of UK regulatory legislation to best advantage. Legislation is passed which lays down a broad-brush picture of a sensitive area's activities and how they need to be monitored. Then the specialist regulator monitors those activities on a day-to-day basis - in the case of IVF, recording the details of every one of the 60,000 cycles carried out in a calendar year, inspecting and licensing clinics in both the NHS and the private sector and approving research involving embryos. In a fast-changing field, decisions on difficult or anomalous cases are taken on an individual basis, with the best available expert advice, and policy is developed to cover new techniques and circumstances as they emerge. The most important consequence of the close scrutiny the HFEA gives is that public confidence is robustly maintained, even as the possibilities given to those unable to have children naturally, but desperate to do so, expand at a giddying speed. Baroness Warnock will have been barely aware in the 1980s of clinical possibilities which now enable parents who carry a rare genetic defect to have their embryos screened, and an undamaged one selected, so that the baby will not die in infancy. She could not have imagined the technique of mitochondrial replacement - removing the nucleus from an egg with mitochondrial abnormalities, and placing it in a donor egg. Over the past two years, the HFEA has carried out a consultation process with clinicians, scientists and the public in order to advise the present government on whether this technique - which has up to now only been allowed in the research laboratory - should be introduced into clinical practice. Perhaps surprisingly, the public supported the new technique, if it could prevent serious illness. They had little objection to its being approved for clinical use, as long as it was scrupulously overseen by an appropriate regulatory body. Like any outgoing chair, there are, of course things I regret not having achieved. My personal mission when I took up the post was, inevitably given my interests, public engagement - disseminating as widely as possible both the benefits and disadvantages of all aspects of assisted reproduction. This proved to be unexpectedly difficult to do. There is an extraordinarily high level of coverage of any story involving IVF in the media - celebrity births, tales of miracle babies after years of trying, and above all, breakthroughs in clinical practice which may bring hope to thousands wishing for their own child. This is a sector that trades in hope, and the papers and women's magazines are full of encouragement. Yet the success rates for IVF remain discouragingly low. The last figures we have show that for every cycle of IVF, fewer than a third of patients will emerge with a baby (the figures are somewhat higher for women under 35). That leaves two thirds of would-be mothers and fathers with the heartbreak of "failure". And the costs are high - 60% of IVF treatment in Britain is carried out in private clinics, but the HFEA has no control over the prices charged. A couple - and nowadays that means same-sex couples as well as traditional partnerships - is likely to have spent something of the order of £15,000 for the three cycles it is likely to have taken should they be fortunate enough to become pregnant. I would have loved to have been able to have spoken more often and more publicly, with more words of caution for those proposing to undertake IVF, or postponing their family because IVF seems a reliable option should natural conception fail. Columnist Zoe Williams wrote a telling piece about the heartache of unsuccessful treatment last month, headlined Where's all the grief going? But newspapers today want banner headlines and excitement. Public information is nowhere on their agenda. Try as I might, I have not been able to talk at length to all those families out there who are about to enter the world of IVF, or who are undergoing treatment and being persuaded to try again and again when it fails, or who are entering their 40s and hoping IVF will allow them to start a late family. The world of IVF is a market, a market in hope. Those who enter it deserve to be fully informed of its potential to deliver grief and a sense of failure, as well as success.

      <title>Is tax good for our health?</title>
      <description>Will a levy on soft drinks help Mexican waistlines?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24645171</url>

      <body>A controversial tax on soft drinks is currently being debated in Mexico's Congress. But can a tax really reduce the nation's waistlines? Sometimes coming top isn't such a good thing. Over a third of Mexican adults are overweight, putting them way up the global league tables for obese nations. A possible cause is found in another of Mexico's dubious honours - being the world's biggest consumer of soft drinks. The health consequences are taking a hefty toll on the country's finances. In 2011, 1.2% of the country's GDP was used to treat obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, which is the same percentage as Canada spent on its entire military. In recent years Mexico's government has tried to combat this epidemic by reducing sugar and fat levels in school breakfasts, and removing processed foods from vending machines in schools. But now the current administration is trying to take a much more controversial step: adding a tax of one peso (equivalent to 8 US cents) onto every litre of soft drink. One man who saw his life come crashing down after the highs of soda is 55-year-old teacher Armando Murillo Salgado. He was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes 15 years ago and sugary drinks are now strictly off the menu. But it was difficult to see the warning signs as he used to drink them "just like any Mexican does." However he is currently in hospital being treated for heart complications related to his diabetes. He says: "I think 50% of my condition is down to soft drinks - because of the ingredients. You can see on any bottle the kind of stuff that goes into them." But Armando is sceptical that higher prices would have stopped him drinking them. "What you're looking for in soft drinks is the flavour, the taste. I might have stopped for a second to ask myself 'wow, how much?!' - but I would still have bought it." Ines Sanchez, a nutritionist at Centro Medico Hospital 20 de Noviembre in Mexico City, where Armando is being treated, agrees that more is needed than a tax. "We need other strategies to address health problems, before we even get to measures like taxes. It's better to teach healthy eating habits and give people alternatives." The tax is being hotly debated around the country. Those in favour say it is a significant first step, while opponents are certain it will not reduce obesity levels, and feel it is just a way of swelling the government's coffers. Jorge Ramo represents the National Association of Soft Drinks and Carbonated Water Manufacturers (ANPRAC). Not surprisingly, he scorns the idea that a tax would do any good. "Taxes are never important in beating health problems. The government has to create adequate programmes to improve the health of Mexicans - but not with a tax." He argues that soft drinks make up only 5% of the average Mexican's daily calorie intake. But Alejandro Calvillo, director of Consumer Power (Poder del Consumidor), one of the NGOs pushing for the tax to be introduced, points to Mexico's number one spot for global soda consumption -a yearly average of 163 litres per person. "If you take out the people who don't drink them - about 5% - and those who only drink them once or twice a week, you're left with a percentage of the population who drink 880ml of soft drinks every day." But why tax soft drinks rather than other unhealthy culprits? Kelly Brownell, professor of public policy at Duke University in the US, was the man who introduced the idea of a "soda tax" back in 1994. There are a long list of reasons to target sugared beverages first, he told the BBC. "Sugared drinks have no nutritional value. The caffeine and sugar may be triggering craving and withdrawal, setting up an addictive-like process. "Finally, the body does not register calories very well when they are delivered in beverages - you do not feel as full." He believes such taxes will be routine in a few years, and the wisdom of using them will be taken for granted - much like taxes on tobacco. Mexico isn't the first country to toy with the idea of so-called 'fat taxes'. Hungary, France and Denmark have all introduced taxes on unhealthy comestibles in the past few years. But last year Denmark repealed its tax on food with more than a 2.3% saturated fat content - a fact which many of those who oppose the Mexican bill bring into the debate. "It failed because people looked for other options," says Jorge Ramo. But fat taxes need to be hefty to work, according to a 2012 study published in the British Medical Journal. It showed the benefits only kicked in when taxes increased prices by about 20% - and the proposed Mexican tax amounts to just a 10% price hike. Really steep increases are likely to leave consumers frothing at the mouth. Indeed, in the United States - where some states have taxed fizzy drinks - there has been strong opposition to the government interfering with something as personal as diet. But Professor Nicholas Finer, a specialist in obesity medicine at University College Hospital in London, believes that government do have a role to play. Not least because it is so difficult for individuals to lose weight of their own accord. "Humans have evolved to survive famine, so our brains tend to tell us it's good to eat as much as we can while it's there, in order to survive the periods of food shortage. "We haven't adapted to our appetites to live in a society with less food shortages. So it makes sense for governments to step in." One thing that both those for and against the tax agree on, is that by itself it will not be enough to significantly reduce the obesity epidemic in Mexico. More support is needed, they say, for the health system as a whole and for healthy eating campaigns, especially those targeted at children. And with or without the tax, Mexico has a long way to go before it slips down the global obesity charts. </body>

      <body>The UK's economic recovery could be "constrained" by a lack of engineering skills, warns a government adviser. Prof John Perkins, chief scientific adviser at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has identified "a substantial demand for engineers". He has issued "a call to action" to government, industry and educators to "step up" to inspire future engineering talent and address skills shortages. Business Secretary Vince Cable said too few teenagers were studying science. "Engineers must have a strong foundation in maths and science, especially physics. "The number of young people choosing these subjects post-16 is relatively low, especially amongst women," said Mr Cable. In his Review of Engineering Skills, Prof Perkins says the UK already relies on "inward migration" to fill skilled jobs in key sectors such as oil and gas extraction, aerospace, and computer, electronic and optical engineering. "This should not be our long-term solution. "We should support the UK's young people by preparing them to compete for highly paid, skilled engineering jobs, improving their career prospects and reducing the need to import engineering skills," says the review. It calls for "purposeful and effective early intervention to enthuse tomorrow's engineers" and ensure they have the "solid academic foundations to engage in the subject". The report calls for as many young people as possible to study "rigorous curricula in maths and science". In particular it says the UK lags behind its competitors in the number of 16- to 18-year-olds studying maths. Prof Perkins says the profession suffers "from widespread misconceptions and lack of visibility that deter young people, and especially girls from pursuing it as a career". The report refers to polling carried out for the Tomorrow's Engineers Week campaign, which suggests that only half of 11- to 14-year olds would consider a career in engineering. This dropped to 35% among girls and only 24% of parents of girls said they thought engineering was a suitable profession for their daughters. Prof Perkins draws "some comfort that we are heading in the right direction" with initiatives to inspire future engineers, a focus on maths and science in schools, more apprenticeships and "our continued strength in higher education". His 22 recommendations urge both short and long term action to "get the right messages to young people" - particularly girls, to ensure vocational training is high quality and high status and that "higher education continues to deliver". The Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said it was making available nearly £49m to boost engineering skills. From January some £30m of this money will allow employers to bid for match-funding for training schemes to address specific engineering skills shortages. Another £18m will fund an elite training facility in Coventry, while Tomorrow's Engineers will get £250,000 to encourage schoolchildren into engineering. Terry Scuoler, chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers' organisation, which represents almost 6,000 companies, said: "The report rightly shines the spotlight on the need for a pipeline of talented future engineers, with credible recommendations on how this can be achieved. "Whilst this is a long-term task, the message from employers is clear - we are ready to take on the challenge." Anne Spackman of the charity Career Academies which runs internship schemes to prepare schoolchildren for employment said efforts to "grow the number of potential recruits" into engineering were crucial. "Engineering is an area rich in job opportunities but lacking the skilled workers to fill them," said Ms Spackman. </body>

      <title>Not reporting abuse 'must be crime'</title>
      <description>Teachers and other professionals who fail to report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the former director of public prosecutions says.</description>

      <body>Teachers and other professionals who do not report child abuse suspicions should face prosecution, the ex-director of public prosecutions says. Keir Starmer said under a British "mandatory reporting" law, those who failed to act could be sent to jail. Declassified files uncovered by BBC Panorama show how schools have repeatedly failed to protect children from sex offenders. But the government said mandatory reporting was not the answer. While statutory guidance has been issued previously urging professionals such as teachers, doctors and social workers to report child abuse, failure to do so is not a crime in England, Scotland and Wales. In Northern Ireland, the Criminal Law Act 1967 makes it an offence to fail to disclose an arrestable offence - including those against children - to police. Mr Starmer, who was succeeded as director of public prosecutions by Alison Saunders on Friday, said it was time to "plug a gap in the law" that had been there for a "very, very long time". "If you're in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, and you have cause to believe that a child has been abused, or is about to be abused, you really ought to do something about it," he said. He said a criminal penalty would "focus people's minds" and said there should be "immunity for individuals if they did report". He said the penalty for failing to report abuse could be a short jail sentence or a fine. "There are just too many examples of cases where those who have suspected abuse have not really done anything about it and the perpetrator has either got away with it or, worse still, been able to perpetuate the offending." He added: "I would have a reasonably broad category of individuals that were subject to the law. "Obviously school teachers, but others in a position of authority or responsibility in relation to children, including other educational institutions, even sporting institutions." Similar laws are already in places in countries including the US, Canada and Australia. For the first time, the Catholic Church and the Church of England have also come out in support of mandatory reporting. Bishop Paul Butler, head of safeguarding at the Church of England, said: "We have to think of the child first, not ourselves, not the institution, what's best for the child." But the government has no plans to change the law. The Department for Education said professionals "should refer immediately to social care when they are concerned about a child". "This happens every year in many thousands of cases and numbers of referrals have increased over recent years," it added. "Other countries have tried mandatory reporting and there is no evidence to show that it is a better system for protecting children." And Dame Clare Tickell, chief executive of the Action for Children, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "We are not convinced that making it mandatory will do what we need it to do." She said the reporting of child abuse in the UK was on the rise and that a "huge issue" was that "teachers and people across the system are not sufficiently trained to see those early signs of abuse". It was important they knew how to spot those signs "and not to feel that they may be prosecuted if they don't", she added. But Jonathan West, of the Mandate Now coalition of charities, welcomed Mr Starmer's call, adding that "social services can't actually act on cases they haven't been told about". He added: "Schools, other organisations, often don't really want to have a child abuse scandal on their hands. "It is surprisingly common that schools want to handle such things in house." Ever since the Jimmy Savile revelations, Panorama has been investigating secret historical records and looking at what government officials knew about abuse in children's homes and boarding schools. Declassified government files going back 60 years show how senior civil servants were well aware that school authorities routinely hid child abuse - preferring instead to protect the reputation of their own institutions - and the law was an inadequate deterrent. One of the most detailed historical files in the National Archives is about a cover-up at the Royal Alexandra and Albert school. Today it is a well-regarded state boarding school in Reigate, Surrey. However, research by Panorama has revealed that seven child abusers worked at the school between the 1950s and the 1980s.

      <title>GCSE overhaul in England made final</title>
      <description>Exams regulator Ofqual confirms it is making changes to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation.</description>

      <body>Exams regulator Ofqual has confirmed the changes it is making to GCSEs, in what it calls the biggest shake-up of exams in England for a generation. A new grading system will use numbers instead of letters, and coursework is being scrapped for most subjects. The changes will be in stages, starting with pupils due to take GCSE exams in 2017. Those who turn 13 in this academic year will be the first. English and maths will be the first subjects affected. Pupils will begin studying the new courses in English language, English literature and maths from the autumn of 2015. And about 20 other popular GCSE subjects will be revamped in the same way, ready for teaching a year later, in 2016, with the first exams for those taken in 2018. The changes apply to England only. Wales is planning its own GCSE shake-up, but Northern Ireland is not planning any changes. Scotland has its own exams system. While they come in, pupils in England will have some exams graded with numbers and some with letters, leading teaching unions to warn this will be confusing for pupils, parents and employers. Exams will be graded from 1 to 9, with 9 being the highest. Pupils who fail will be awarded a "U" for an unclassified result. All exams will be taken after two years of study, rather than in modules taken at various stages over two years, meaning a return to the format of O-levels, which pre-dated GCSEs. And there will be more marks awarded for spelling, punctuation and grammar. The head of Ofqual, Glenys Stacey, said the changes were "fundamental". "This is the biggest change in a generation," she said. "They [GCSEs] have been around for over 25 years but now we are seeing fresh content, a different structure, high-quality assessment coming in. "It's a significant change for students and for schools." Ms Stacey said the move to a numerical system meant a new grade was being added and that would help examiners distinguish between candidates' performance - especially at the top grades. She suggested that the move away from traditional grades might be hard for some people to understand, but was important. "The new qualifications will be significantly different and we need to signal this clearly," she said. At the same time, the government is confirming changes to what has to be studied in English language, English literature and maths, because the overhaul of exams covers both what is studied and how it is assessed. It says in English literature, students will have to "study whole texts in detail, covering a range of literature including Shakespeare, 19th Century novels, Romantic poetry and other high-quality fiction and drama". The new maths exam will cover more topics and will be more challenging, the government says. Details were released on Friday morning. For maths, Ofqual is keeping the present arrangement where pupils can be entered for either a higher- or lower-tier paper in maths, depending on their ability. But in English, that division has been scrapped and one exam will be taken by all. At the moment, students who are entered for easier papers can be awarded only the maximum of a C grade. The government says young people were let down by the old exam system; that frequent testing meant not enough time was spent on "deep learning" and not enough attention was paid to grammar, spelling and punctuation. Schools Minister Elizabeth Truss says the changes will improve students' "core skills" in maths and English and raise expectations. "What we want to do is encourage schools to focus on those core skills that employers really want, because that is what is going to help our children get jobs when they leave school," she said. Headteachers' representative, the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), gave what it said was a "cautious welcome" to the changes. Deputy general secretary Malcolm Trobe said: "There is much to welcome in today's announcement, especially the measured approach Ofqual has taken to this significant task. "We have always agreed that GCSE can be improved to better prepare students to meet the needs of the world we live in today. But the constant tinkering with GCSEs we have had in the past has not been helpful." Unions representing classroom teachers warned that a shift away from coursework and having different levels of exams for different abilities could damage some pupils' education. Secondary school teacher and spokesman for the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, Jovan Trkulja, said that less able students could suffer. "Exams are challenging and they should continue to be challenging. But we have to remember that setting the top of the mountain as the baseline means someone has to fall behind, and I feel for the sense of failure for the less able," he said. Shadow schools minister, Labour MP Kevin Brennan, said he had "reservations" about some aspects of the changes and that the move towards a numbered grading system was a step back to the 1970s. He said he agreed that the pendulum "might have swung a little too far on coursework", but there was now a danger that "it will swing too far the other way". "Having everything staked on one final exam is not great for all pupils," he said. </body>

      <title>Council tracks school-run on CCTV</title>
      <description>A London council is thought to be the first local authority to confirm it uses CCTV cameras to spot illegal school run parking.</description>

      <body>A north London council has confirmed it is using CCTV cameras to target parents who park illegally on the school run. Enfield Council has set up cameras outside schools that record number plates of cars parked illegally for more than three seconds. The system's manufacturers say other boroughs are also trialling the system, but did not confirm which ones. Local authorities say the cameras will improve safety but opponents say it is just a way of raising money. The data is recorded and reported back to councils and either a warning letter can be issued or a penalty fine. Paul Pearson, of parking campaign group Penalty Charge Notice, said there was not enough places for parents to park. Alex Henney, the general secretary of the National Motorists' Action Group, said a civil enforcement officer should be used instead of the cameras. "It seems to me that probably there's an agenda to generate money - that is illegal," he said. "In my view, the sensible approach is to get the council and school head together to discuss it with the parents to sort out some arrangement." However, Amanda Philips, the head teacher at Old Ford Primary School in Tower Hamlets, east London, said the school had tried to address parking issues by communicating with families, the local council and the police but there is a problem. "It is as always a very small number of families with particular cars that we can identify that we constantly have conversations with," she said. Dave Richmond, the joint director of camera manufacturers Videalert, said he did not believe it would be a "cash cow" as once several tickets were issued, drivers would stop parking illegally. He said the problem with using civil enforcement officers is that drivers comply with the rules when an officer is present, but revert back to their normal behaviour when they have gone. "If you watch the videos that I have seen, some of the behaviour of drivers outside schools is like the Rocky Horror Show," Mr Richmond said. "It is really bad and therefore this is a safety issue and it needs to be dealt with." In a statement, Enfield Council said it was "committed to improving road safety for all pedestrians, especially children walking to and from school, and reducing road safety related casualties. "This is a pilot project and we will evaluate its success before making any decisions on future use," it said. </body>

      <title>'Raise tuition fees with inflation'</title>
      <description>University tuition fees should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged.</description>

      <body>University tuition fees in England should rise in line with inflation, a university leader has urged. Sir Christopher Snowden, vice-chancellor of the University of Surrey and president of Universities UK, says a £9,000 fee cap is "not sustainable". "The whole issue is that fees can't remain frozen for ever", he told Times Higher Education magazine. The National Union of Students (NUS) said last year's trebling in fees had already far outpaced rising costs. Sir Christopher's comments follow a recent call from the vice-chancellor of Oxford University, Andrew Hamilton, for undergraduate fees to be "more closely related to the true cost" of a degree at Oxford, £16,000. Last month Prof Hamilton said the funding shortfall meant Oxford faced an annual funding gap of £70m. Sir Christopher said that Surrey had "several subjects where we are losing substantial sums of money teaching UK and EU students". He said these included science, technology and engineering courses. Sir Christopher added: "On aggregate the £9,000 was perhaps a reasonable starting point, but it really needs to have a sensible indexing linked to it." He said that the £9,000 maximum fees paid by students would be worth only around £8,250 by 2016 when inflation was factored in. However, Sir Christopher told the magazine that he was not an advocate of a major jump in fees: "I don't think that £16,000 is a likely scenario in the near future." Universities UK will publish a report next week on the future of university financing. This is expected to look at how universities will fund a predicted 26% rise in demand for university places within the next 20 years. Universities Minister David Willetts has said a rising birthrate will mean the number of university places needed will grow from 368,000 to 460,000. The paper is expected to explore where universities will find the capital to expand their facilities and accommodation. Universities UK points out that the rise in tuition fees paid by students was accompanied by a corresponding cut in the level of government funding for universities. The NUS said suggestions that undergraduates should pay more were unlikely to win sympathy from students or their parents. Union president Toni Pearce said: "What seems to have been missed here is the inflation-busting increases on the upper limit on tuition fees just last year, when the cap was nearly tripled to an eye-watering £9,000. "We've already seen a huge shift onto the shoulders of individuals through higher fees that far outpace rising costs. "Students and their families are facing a huge financial squeeze. The value of both earnings and student financial support is falling in real terms and the cost of making ends meet is increasing by the day." The government said its reforms had put the higher education sector on a more sustainable footing. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We believe the £9,000 fee allows universities to deliver high-quality teaching, with many institutions now planning to invest more in improved teaching facilities for students. "We want to ensure that going to university remains affordable for students and it is based on their ability, not their ability to pay." </body>

      <body>The University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) has received what it says is one of the biggest ever donations to a UK university. The £20m gift - worth more than a quarter of its annual turnover - would be "transformational", SOAS said. It came from the Alphawood Foundation in Chicago, set up by Fred Eychaner, a former Asian art student at SOAS. The money will pay for building upgrades, research and scholarships. Prof Paul Webley, director of SOAS, said the university was "thrilled" to be working with Alphawood. "SOAS has been studying and interpreting the development, languages, arts and cultures of Asia for nearly 100 years and this project will draw on that knowledge as well as further reinforce our position as a world-leading centre for the study and interpretation of South East Asian art." The donation includes £5m towards building development and £15m to be spent on research into South East Asian Art as well as improving links with the region. SOAS said the money would be used to bring post-graduate students from the south-east Asia to London. It also wants to establish three new academic posts, including professorships in Buddhist and Hindu art, and develop links with like-minded institutions in countries such as Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos. Mr Eychaner, a broadcasting tycoon who owns a string of radio stations, said he wanted his money to build bridges, especially in areas of Asia held back in the 20th Century by war and politics. "Alphawood Foundation seeks to stimulate and expand the study of South East Asian art at all levels - from an educated and interested public to museum professionals to new PhD-level scholars. "We chose to advance this goal by making our largest gift to date to SOAS because this school creates a very special learning and research environment where West meets East." Mr Eychaner - who owned a television station until he sold it to Rupert Murdoch's Fox network - studied for a post-graduate diploma at SOAS, which currently has more than 5,000 students from 130 countries. </body>

      <description>Alex Salmond accuses the Home Office of "sabotage" after visas were denied for two Chinese teachers returning to work in Scotland.</description>

      <body>First Minister Alex Salmond has accused the Home Office of "sabotage" after visas were denied for two Chinese teachers returning to work in Scotland through a partnership programme. Mr Salmond, who is currently on a visit to China, has lodged a protest. He said the move amounted to sabotage of Scottish government efforts to build cultural links. The Home Office said it was looking into the matter which was being taken seriously. The teaching programme is run by the Confucius Institute, backed by Strathclyde University and the Scottish government. It involves teachers from China offering Scottish pupils the chance to acquire skills in Mandarin and Chinese culture. Five teachers from Tian Jin municipality were due to return to Scotland for a second year, but two of them have been told their visas will not be renewed. Mr Salmond has written to UK Home Secretary Theresa May voicing his shock and dismay and warned that the episode risks damaging Scotland's relationship with China. Speaking to BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said: "It is an absolutely extraordinary situation you couldn't make it up. It is deeply offensive to the Chinese and it is a decision that needs to be reversed as soon as possible. "This amounts to sabotage of a programme that everyone thinks absolutely fantastic and doing great work in Scotland. "The importance of this is quite fundamental. Our argument is to have a successful economic relationship with China you must have it underpinned by a successful cultural relationship, that is the view of the Chinese, that is the view of the Scottish government. "If you undermine one you undermine the other." A Home Office spokeswoman said: "We have received the letter from the Scottish government and we have been in contact with them over these cases. "We are taking this matter seriously and will be looking into the decisions." </body>

      <title>How technology best boosts learning</title>
      <description>An inner city primary is at the heart of a research project on how tablet computers may boost children's learning.</description>

      <body>An inner city primary is at the heart of a project to test how technology can be used to boost children's learning. Rosendale Primary, in south London, won a £253,000 grant for the research which will involve 1,400 pupils in 24 schools in London, Essex and Manchester. Rosendale pupils use tablet computers to photograph their work and tag it with notes about how well they learned. The Lambeth school's head teacher, Kate Atkins, says the aim is to help pupils develop a range of learning strategies. "Poor learners are often over-confident about the power of their memories and can struggle to find alternative strategies. "We need to encourage them to think about how they learn and to try something else." Children at the school are encouraged to reflect on every piece of work or unit of learning. They are asked to think about which bits went well, what they struggled with and what they might need to do to improve when they next revisit the subject. A key part of this is to ask children how they felt about each piece of work, for example many children find conducting a science experiment exciting and fun but hate having to sit down and write it up afterwards, says Ms Atkins. "An emotional reaction is a key part of the learning process." The research project aims to test whether the strategy actually improves pupils' attainment. It will be tested at 24 two-form-entry schools, one form will carry on as normal, the other will record and reflect on their learning using digital note-taking. Children will be tested at the start and finish of the project to measure their abilities and the results evaluated at Manchester University. The project is one of seven in a £3.5m strategy by the Education Endowment Foundation and Nominet Trust to evaluate the impact of technology in schools . The charities say the aim is to "rigorously test" new ways to use technology to improve attainment, particularly of less advantaged children. The grants will support 18,000 pupils in 260 schools across England. Another project, centred on Shireland Collegiate Academy in Sandwell, West Midlands, will test the effectiveness of a "flipped learning" approach. In effect pupils do their homework before the lesson, watching a video or web presentation on a new concept the night before. The lesson itself then focuses on a more detailed exploration of the concept, perhaps experimentation or discussion, and on helping struggling pupils. Dan Sutch of the Nominet Trust said: "The more we can understand where technology best supports learning and teaching the better." The Education Endowment Foundation said the grants would help identify the most effective ways to use digital technology to improve learning for the most disadvantaged pupils. Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said schools spent huge sums on technology but there was too little evidence of its effectiveness. "The gap in educational outcomes between rich and poor is the biggest barrier to social mobility we face and it is essential to find out if and how technology can be used to help close it." </body>

      <title>Baby P mother 'released from prison'</title>
      <description>The mother of baby Peter Connelly has been released from prison four years after being jailed over his death, it is understood.</description>

      <body>Baby Peter Connelly's mother, who was jailed over his death, has been freed from prison, it is understood. Tracey Connelly was jailed for a minimum of five years in 2009 after admitting causing or allowing her son's death. She had also spent more than a year in custody on remand. The Parole Board recently said it had recommended her release. Peter died in August 2007 with more than 50 injuries, despite being on a social services "at-risk" register. His death at home in Tottenham, north London, came a day after police told his mother she would not be prosecuted over abuse of the 17-month-old. Social workers, health professionals and police officers had visited 60 times in eight months. The Ministry of Justice refused to confirm whether Connelly had been released, saying it did not comment on individual cases. Connelly first became eligible for parole in August 2012. The Parole Board did not recommend her release then, but a three-strong panel said she should be released following a second review. She admitted causing or allowing Peter's death soon after being charged, and spent more than a year on remand before being sentenced in May 2009. The sentence was "imprisonment for public protection", which carries a minimum term after which prisoners can be considered for release. When deciding whether to release a prisoner, the Parole Board must consider the nature of their crime, their history, their progress in prison, any statements made on their behalf and reports from relevant professionals. Connelly was jailed with her boyfriend Steven Barker and his brother Jason Owen, who were convicted at trial of the same offence she admitted. Barker was given a 12-year sentence for his "major role" in Peter's death. Owen was jailed indefinitely with a minimum three-year term, but later on appeal that was changed to a fixed six-year term. He was freed in August 2011 but has since been recalled to prison. This week the BBC's Newsnight programme revealed Sharon Shoesmith, who was head of children's services at Haringey Council at the time of Peter's death, had agreed a "six-figure payout" for unfair dismissal after the case. </body>

      <body>Primary schools in England this year queried the results of more than 5,500 maths and reading tests taken by 10 and 11-year-olds, official figures show. This year's figures, published by the Department for Education (DfE), show an 87.8% rise on last year, when schools queried 2,949 papers. The tests are taken by all pupils in their last term of primary school. The government says the proportion of queries is "just 0.4% of more than 1.7m papers marked". All pupils are expected to reach level four in the tests. These figures are for the numbers of queries on tests rated at levels three to five. In total, schools requested 3,680 reviews of English tests and 1,857 reviews of maths tests, amounting to a total of 5,537 papers. Last year there were 2,197 queries in English and 752 for maths. On the maths paper this year's answer queries were focussed on one particular question which may be part of the reason for the rise, suggests the DfE. In their report on the figures, government statisticians caution that it is difficult to make valid comparisons between this year's statistics and previous years because of variations to the marking process. Schools' reasons for requesting reviews of papers also change year by year, says the report. The reviews resulted in 871 pupils having their levels raised in reading and 384 in maths - but levels on 21 reading papers and nine maths papers were lowered. The government says the proportion of reviews which led to a level change fell by more than 10% compared with last year. A DfE spokesman said: "Pupils, parents and schools have the right to expect test papers to be marked accurately. "Today's figures show that just 0.4 per cent of more than 1.7 million papers marked were submitted for review and that the new English grammar, punctuation and spelling test had the lowest proportion of applications of any of the levels 3-5 tests." This year pupils sat a spelling, punctuation and grammar test for the first time. Schools sent 669 of these papers back for review. Schools also queried 1,073 level six papers which are taken by pupils who are achieving well above the expected standard for their age. </body>

      <body>Four more regional colleges have been created as the Scottish government's merger programme in the further education sector continues. The new institutions are North East Scotland College, Dundee and Angus College, Glasgow Kelvin College and New College Lanarkshire. The programme is bringing colleges in different parts of the country together as part of wider reforms. The mergers are designed to save money and combine teaching expertise. But Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have previously accused the government of forcing colleges into "shotgun marriages" and seeking to diminish the independence of the sector. North East Scotland College is made up of Aberdeen and Banff and Buchan colleges, Dundee and Angus colleges have merged into one and Glasgow Kelvin College brings together North Glasgow, Stow and John Wheatley colleges. Meanwhile, Motherwell and Cumbernauld colleges will become New College Lanarkshire, with Coatbridge College due to unite with them in 2014. Education Secretary Michael Russell said: "This is an exciting day with many events being held for staff and students to mark the occasion of these new larger colleges becoming a reality. "It is a tribute to their hard work - and that of the college boards - that this milestone has been reached. "The aim of these reforms has always been about making the college sector work for students, communities, staff and employers, and creating opportunities for them to thrive." John Henderson, chief executive of Colleges Scotland, said: "Each of the new colleges is working to strengthen their offering to students and to local and regional employers, driving the Scottish economy as a whole. "The college sector has gone through an unprecedented period of change and it has done so in a positive and tenacious manner." </body>

      <body>Lecturers and support staff at many UK universities are staging a walkout over pay. Unions say there is "strong support for the action" and 149 institutions are affected. But university employers say support for the strike is "not widespread" and disruption has been "minimal". Rallies are planned for many cities over lunchtime as part of joint action between the University and College Union (UCU), Unison and Unite. Union members say their pay has failed to keep up with rising living costs and have rejected a 1% pay offer. But university employers say the "vast majority" of staff think the offer is fair. Officials from the UCU say early reports are that some buildings and departments - including many libraries - have been closed. Teaching at Liverpool John Moores University and Liverpool Hope University has been cancelled and the chemistry department at Loughborough is shut, they say. The unions have rejected a pay offer of 1%, which they say represents a 13% pay cut in real terms since 2009. They say universities will face the "most widespread disruption for years". UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said: "Staff, from porters to professors have walked out this morning in protest at some of the most sustained pay cuts since the Second World War. "Nobody wants to be on strike, but a 13% real-terms pay cut as vice-chancellors' pay continued to increase and universities' surpluses built up simply is not fair." She said the unions had heard of closed departments and buildings and that some universities had cancelled all teaching for the day. "If the employers try to spin the action as having little impact then it merely shows how out of touch they are with what is really happening on the ground at universities." There was a 35% turnout in the UCU strike ballot, with 62% voting in favour of strike action. Universities had warned students some classes might be cancelled and that some some facilities could be closed. Helen Fairfoul, chief executive of the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA), told BBC News fewer than 5% of the higher education workforce had chosen to vote for strike action. "We can see the strike is not widely supported," she said. "The vast majority of staff think this is a fair offer. This is a difficult period. No pay levels in any sector have kept pace with inflation." She added that salary costs in most institutions would actually rise by about 3% this year because some staff would get incremental increases and merit awards as well as the 1% increase. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said: "We are disappointed that the unions have decided in favour of industrial action. Students have the right to expect that their learning will not be disrupted by such action." </body>

      <body>A strike by pupil support assistants has resulted in Glasgow City Council closing 10 schools for children with extra learning needs and disabilities. The 24-hour action is over a dispute about extra duties such as healthcare and the administration of medicine. The union, Unison, said members had not been properly trained for these duties or offered the correct pay. The council said it had offered to improve pay but the union had rejected its attempts to reach a compromise. Glasgow City Council said seven schools for complex learning needs had closed: Broomlea School; Milton Secondary; Croftcroighn Primary; Newhills Secondary; Langlands Primary; Linburn Secondary and Hampden Primary. Ashcraig Secondary, Kelbourne Park Primary and Hazelwood School - which educate children with physical, visual and hearing impairment - are also closed. All mainstream schools are open but some children have had to stay home following a risk assessment by the headteacher. The council said the only mainstream school affected by the action was Hyndland Primary which was closed to P1, P2 and P3 pupils. Unison said the council expected pupil support assistants (PSAs) to take on "significant" extra duties which should be delivered by professional healthcare workers. These include: blood glucose monitoring, injections, gastronomy tube/peg feeding, tracheostomy care including suction, catheterisation and catheter care. The union said PSAs were currently paid an annual salary of £11,800 and it wanted the extra duties assigned to a higher grade post than that held currently held by PSAs. It said there had been "no offer of increased pay for all PSAs, instructors or care staff for the administration of medicines". Unison official, Carol Ball, said: "PSAs took their job to deliver education, not healthcare. "Despite council claims PSAs are not receiving proper training to carry out what are medical procedures. "And the council can't have it both ways. If PSAs have been trained and have the skills and responsibility of delivering these complex needs then the case for keeping them on the lowest level of pay collapses." Councillor Stephen Curran, executive member for education and young people, said the union had rejected all attempts at reaching a deal. "We are really disappointed and sorry that Unison has decided to go ahead with the industrial action which will stop our most vulnerable young people coming to school," he said. "We had organised another meeting on Tuesday to discuss our latest compromise offer - this has again been rejected. "Throughout this dispute we have listened to their concerns and have offered to improve the pay of support staff." Mr Curran added: "It is clear that Unison is not prepared to agree a compromise which would be in the best interests of their members." </body>

      <body>The music of ancient Greece, unheard for thousands of years, is being brought back to life by Armand D'Angour, a musician and tutor in classics at Oxford University. He describes what his research is discovering. "Suppose that 2,500 years from now all that survived of the Beatles songs were a few of the lyrics, and all that remained of Mozart and Verdi's operas were the words and not the music. Imagine if we could then reconstruct the music, rediscover the instruments that played them, and hear the words once again in their proper setting, how exciting that would be. This is about to happen with the classic texts of ancient Greece. It is often forgotten that the writings at the root of Western literature - the epics of Homer, the love-poems of Sappho, the tragedies of Sophocles and Euripides - were all, originally, music. Dating from around 750 to 400 BC, they were composed to be sung in whole or part to the accompaniment of the lyre, reed-pipes, and percussion instruments. But isn't the music lost beyond recovery? The answer is no. The rhythms - perhaps the most important aspect of music - are preserved in the words themselves, in the patterns of long and short syllables. The instruments are known from descriptions, paintings and archaeological remains, which allow us to establish the timbres and range of pitches they produced. And now, new revelations about ancient Greek music have emerged from a few dozen ancient documents inscribed with a vocal notation devised around 450 BC, consisting of alphabetic letters and signs placed above the vowels of the Greek words. The Greeks had worked out the mathematical ratios of musical intervals - an octave is 2:1, a fifth 3:2, a fourth 4:3, and so on. The notation gives an accurate indication of relative pitch: letter A at the top of the scale, for instance, represents a musical note a fifth higher than N halfway down the alphabet. Absolute pitch can be worked out from the vocal ranges required to sing the surviving tunes. While the documents, found on stone in Greece and papyrus in Egypt, have long been known to classicists - some were published as early as 1581 - in recent decades they have been augmented by new finds. Dating from around 300 BC to 300 AD, these fragments offer us a clearer view than ever before of the music of ancient Greece. The research project that I have embarked on, funded by the British Academy, has the aim of bringing this music back to life. But it is important to realise that ancient rhythmical and melodic norms were different from our own. We must set aside our Western preconceptions. A better parallel is non-Western folk traditions, such as those of India and the Middle East. Instrumental practices that derive from ancient Greek traditions still survive in areas of Sardinia and Turkey, and give us an insight into the sounds and techniques that created the experience of music in ancient times. So what did Greek music sound like? Some of the surviving melodies are immediately attractive to a modern ear. One complete piece, inscribed on a marble column and dating from around 200 AD, is a haunting short song of four lines composed by Seikilos. The words of the song may be translated: While you're alive, shine: never let your mood decline. We've a brief span of life to spend: Time necessitates an end. The notation is unequivocal. It marks a regular rhythmic beat, and indicates a very important principle of ancient composition. In ancient Greek the voice went up in pitch on certain syllables and fell on others (the accents of ancient Greek indicate pitch, not stress). The contours of the melody follow those pitches here, and fairly consistently in all the documents. But one shouldn't assume that the Greeks' idea of tuning was identical to ours. Ptolemy in the 2nd century AD provides precise mathematical ratios for numerous different scale-tunings, including one that he says sounds "foreign and homespun". Dr David Creese of the University of Newcastle has constructed an eight-string "canon" (a zither-like instrument) with movable bridges. When he plays two versions of the Seikilos tune using Ptolemy's tunings, the second immediately strikes us as exotic, more like Middle Eastern than Western music. The earliest musical document that survives preserves a few bars of sung music from a play, Orestes by the fifth-century BC tragedian Euripides. It may even be music Euripides himself wrote. Music of this period used subtle intervals such as quarter-tones. We also find that the melody doesn't conform to the word pitches at all. Euripides was a notoriously avant-garde composer, and this indicates one of the ways in which his music was heard to be wildly modern: it violated the long-held norms of Greek folk singing by neglecting word-pitch. However, we can recognise that Euripides adopted another principle. The words "I lament" and "I beseech" are set to a falling, mournful-sounding cadence; and when the singer says "my heart leaps wildly", the melody leaps as well. This was ancient Greek soundtrack music. And it was received with great excitement in the Greek world. The historian Plutarch tells a moving story about the thousands of Athenian soldiers held prisoner in roasting Syracusan quarries after a disastrous campaign in 413 BC. Those few who were able to sing Euripides' latest songs were able to earn some food and drink. What about the greatest of ancient poet-singers, Homer himself? Homer tells us that bards of his period sang to a four-stringed lyre, called a "phorminx". Those strings will probably have been tuned to the four notes that survived at the core of the later Greek scale systems. Professor Martin West of Oxford has reconstructed the singing of Homer on that basis. The result is a fairly monotonous tune, which probably explains why the tradition of Homeric recitation without melody emerged from what was originally a sung composition. "What song the Sirens sang," is the first of the questions listed by the 17th Century English writer, Sir Thomas Browne, as "puzzling, though not beyond all conjecture". "The reconstruction of ancient Greek music is bringing us a step closer to answering the question." </body>

      <title>Asia’s parents suffering 'education fever'</title>
      <description>Asia's 'tiger parents' paying a high price for children's future</description>

      <body>Zhang Yang, a bright 18-year old from a rural town in Anhui province in China was accepted to study at a prestigious traditional medicine college in Hefei. But the news was too much for his father Zhang Jiasheng. Zhang's father was partly paralysed after he suffered a stroke two years ago and could no longer work. He feared the family, already in debt to pay for medicines, would not be able to afford his son's tuition fees. As his son headed home to celebrate his success, Zhang Jiasheng killed himself by swallowing pesticide. Zhang's case is an extreme. But East Asian families are spending more and more of their money on securing their children the best possible education. In richer Asian countries such as South Korea and emerging countries like China, "education fever" is forcing families to make choices, sometimes dramatic ones, to afford the bills. There are families selling their apartments to raise the funds to send their children to study overseas. Andrew Kipnis, an anthropologist at Australian National University and author of a recent book on the intense desire for education in China, says the amount spent on education is "becoming extreme". It is not just middle-class families. Workers also want their children to do better than themselves and see education as the only means of ensuring social mobility. Some go deep into debt. "Families are spending less on other things. There are many cases of rural parents not buying healthcare that their doctors urge on them... Part of the reason is that they would rather spend the money on their children's education," said Mr Kipnis. "Parents may be forced to put off building a new house, which they might have been able to do otherwise," said Mr Kipnis who did the bulk of his research in Zouping district in Shandong province, among both middle-class and rural households. "It can be very intense. They often borrow from relatives. Of course some people have difficulty paying it back," said Mr Kipnis. A Euromonitor survey found that per capita annual disposable income in China rose by 63.3% in the five years to 2012, yet consumer expenditure on education rose by almost 94%. It's not just the parents' incomes. Educating a child has become an extended-family project. "It goes beyond tiger mothers, it also includes tiger grandmothers and grandfathers," said Todd Maurer, an expert on education in Asia and partner at the consultancy firm, Sinica Advisors. There is evidence of high levels of education spending in China, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore. Spending is also increasing in India and Indonesia. In South Korea, where the government believes "education obsession" is damaging society, family expenditure on education has helped push household debt to record levels. According to the LG Economic Research Institute, 28% of South Korean households cannot afford monthly loan repayments, and are hard pressed to live off their incomes. A huge proportion of that income - 70% of Korean household expenditure, according to estimates by the Samsung Economic Research Institute in Seoul, goes toward private education, to get an educational edge over other families. Families cut back on other household spending "across the board," said Michael Seth, professor of Korean history at James Madison University in the US and author of a book on South Korea's education zeal. "There is less money to spend on other things like housing, retirement, or vacations." "Every developing country in Asia, specially China, seems to have a similar pattern," said Prof Seth. A highly competitive examination system and rising aspirations are often blamed. "The Korean education system puts enormous pressure on children," said Prof Seth." The only way to opt out of the system is not to have children. It is so expensive to educate a child that it is undoubtedly a factor in South Korea's very low birth rate," he said. The education obsession is so all consuming that the South Korean government has unsuccessfully tried to curb it, concerned about family spending on extra-curricular lessons and cram schools for ferociously competitive exams. While not yet at South Korean levels, China's education fever also puts pressure on family spending. A recent survey by market research company Mintel, found that nine out of 10 children from middle class families in China attended fee-charging after-school activities. Parents believe these activities will help their children when it comes to university entry. Children are being tutored for longer, starting younger. Where before it was for a year or two before the university entrance exam, now it can start in middle school or even primary. Matthew Crabbe, Asia research director at Mintel, says that people in China are using the savings that might have been put aside for healthcare. "But because the cost of education has risen and the competition for places at good universities have become so much more intense, they are investing more of their savings to make sure the child can get the grades they would need to get in." It does not stop there. Nearly 87% of Chinese parents said they were willing to fund study abroad. In the past an overseas education was confined to the most privileged. Now many more want foreign degrees to give them a shortcut to success. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a third of Chinese students studying abroad in 2010 were from working-class families. This is a massive financial burden and parents may not realise the true costs. According to Zhang Jianbai who runs a private school in Yunnan province, parents in small provincial cities often sell their apartments to fund their children's study overseas. "Parents decide very early on that their children are going to go abroad and that requires quite a bit of money because [the preparation] cannot be acquired through the public education system," said Mr Maurer. It can include intensive English lessons, study tours to the US and significant payments for student recruitment agents. Last year an estimated 40,000 Chinese students travelled to Hong Kong to take the US college admissions exam, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATS), which is not offered in mainland China. Chinese education company, New Oriental Education, organises SAT trips to Hong Kong for $1,000 (£627) on average, and parents spend up to $8,000 (£5,020) on tutoring. Once confined to affluent Beijing and Shanghai, it is an expanding market. The company expects its revenue to grow by over 40% in China's second and third tier cities. "Parents are surrendering their last resources to wager them on a child's future by sending them abroad," said Lao Kaisheng, an education policy researcher at Capital Normal University in Beijing. It means that when young people graduate there is great pressure on them to start earning. This is particularly an issue as record numbers of students graduate, seven million this year, and an overseas degree no longer has the status it had in the past. Many graduates languish in non-graduate jobs. But it is not easy to dampen education fever. In South Korea as in other East Asian countries, "it is deeply embedded in the culture. It's also based on reality that there is no alternative pathway to success or a good career other than a prestige degree, this was true 50 years ago, and it's just as true today". "As long as that's the case it's actually rational for parents to spend so much and put so much pressure on their children," said Prof Seth. </body>

      <title>Teachers in China 'highest status'</title>
      <description>Teachers in China are the most highly respected, in an international study comparing the status of teachers in 21 countries.</description>

      <body>Teachers in China have the highest levels of public respect, according to an international study comparing their status in 21 countries. Teachers in the UK were in 10th place in the global index which was compiled by the University of Sussex professor Peter Dolton. The study was based on surveys of 1,000 adults in each of the countries. This examined public attitudes to professional status, trust, pay and the desirability of teaching as a career. The study confirmed the high status of teachers in China, where there is a strong cultural emphasis on the importance of education. "Teachers are revered," says Prof Dolton. A large majority of adults in China believed that students would respect their teachers - in contrast to most European countries where only a minority believed that students would show respect. In the UK, only about one in five adults believed that students showed their teachers respect in school. And while teachers in China were compared with doctors, in the UK they were more likely to be bracketed with nurses and social workers. In the US, people compared teachers with librarians and in Japan the feeling was that they were on a par with local government officials. This reveals the cultural differences in how the role of teaching is perceived, says Prof Dolton, a professor of economics at Sussex University and senior research fellow at the Centre for Economic Performance at the London School of Economics. The status of teachers in China was considerably above the next highest countries, which were Greece, Turkey and South Korea. The study, published by the Varkey GEMS Foundation, also included some results that might be thought of as unexpected. Finland, often seen as a model for recruiting high-quality, high-status teachers, was in the bottom half of the rankings, in 13th place. while Germany (16th) and Japan (17th) were ranked among the lowest countries. No countries from sub-Saharan Africa were included in the survey. The findings for the UK are based on a single national figure, rather than individual devolved administrations. They show a positive picture in public attitudes, with much higher levels of trust in the education system than in the US and most other European countries in the survey. There was a considerable level of public support for teachers - with a majority believing that they should be better paid and also underestimating the starting salary for teachers (currently about £22,000 in England outside London). More people thought that teachers' unions should have greater influence, compared with those who thought that they had too much influence. But a large majority were sympathetic to the principle of performance pay for teachers. Head teachers in the UK are particularly highly respected - more so than in any other of the countries surveyed. Former education minister, Lord Adonis, said the rankings showed the importance of the role of teaching in education reform. "To recruit the brightest and best, teaching needs to be a high status occupation, and we need to understand better what contributes to the social standing of teachers," said Lord Adonis. Sunny Varkey, founder of the Varkey GEMS Foundation, said: "It is my ambition that teachers are treated with as much respect as doctors. Sadly, in many countries around the world teachers no longer retain the elevated status that we used to take for granted." Prof Dalton says the public status of teaching will influence standards of education. "This informs who decides to become a teacher in each country, how they are respected and how they are financially rewarded. Ultimately, this affects the kind of job they do in teaching our children," he says. </body>

      <title>Stones and apples thrown at university reformer</title>
      <description>The tough struggle to modernise Kurdistan's education system</description>

      <body>Prof Dlawer Ala'Aldeen had tomatoes, stones and apples thrown at him. He faced countless demonstrations. The reason for this hostility, facing the microbiologist from the University of Nottingham, was his controversial attempt to reform the university system in his birthplace of Kurdistan. Prof Ala'Aldeen was the architect of plans to improve the quality and to internationalise higher education in Iraqi Kurdistan. He says he was up against "deeply entrenched interests, people, institutions and long stagnant cultures". The region, autonomous for two decades in the wake of the Gulf War, had inherited a post-Saddam university system that Prof Ala'Aldeen has described as "grossly outdated" and designed for a closed, centralised country. In 2009 Prof Ala'Aldeen was given a secondment away from his job as professor of clinical microbiology at Nottingham University in the UK. He stepped from academic life in the English midlands into the role of Kurdistan's higher education minister, a post he held until last year. Prime Minister Barham Salih, a good friend, chose him for his knowledge of the higher education system and the series of critical articles on education and governance he had written in the years up to his appointment. Barham Salih's election manifesto had included significant support for higher education and training to support Kurdistan's large population of under 20 year olds. There were already plans for more scholarships to send talented students to study overseas. Within a week of being appointed, Prof Ala'Aldeen had written up a radical vision document and it was quickly endorsed by the cabinet. Higher education in Kurdistan was suffering a major crisis of quality, capacity and infrastructure. There was a consensus in support of reform and it helped that Prof Ala'Aldeen had been very critical of the government in the past. The reforms, which planned to improve the quality and accreditation of university teachers, brought considerable opposition from student and teacher organisations as well as businesses linked with the burgeoning market in private universities. Several new private universities were threatened with closure, much to the anger of their staff and prospective students who had paid fees for their courses. "Many teachers had been licensed prematurely. There were 11 private universities when I started with 18 more waiting to be opened. These mushrooming private colleges were relying on the same pool of resources as the public universities which lacked staff and facilities," Prof Ala'Aldeen says. The problem of staffing was particularly acute in medicine, pharmacy and dentistry and in postgraduate studies. But Prof Ala'Aldeen faced protests and opposition. He was accused of trying to transplant the UK system onto Kurdistan, something he vehemently denies since he was educated and worked in his home region, before coming to study in the UK. "I knew the system from the inside and studied what had happened in similar countries. I wanted to apply international principles of quality, but tailor-made to Kurdish traditions," he says. He responded by redoubling his efforts to communicate the purpose of the reforms, which also included curriculum development, moving beyond a single teacher delivering a lecture to a class, the introduction of an electronic admissions system and reforming the teaching of PhDs. In the end, the government closed three private universities as well as five health-related colleges, three pharmacy colleges and two dentistry ones. "If we had allowed the system to keep evolving as it was it would have taken at least a generation to fix it - a generation would have been wasted. We knew we had to act fast. It was a risky policy, but it would have been far riskier to do nothing," he says. The speed of his action was criticised as were aspects of the efforts to improve teaching standards, such as student feedback being used to measure teacher performance and pay. There was also opposition to teachers being asked to engage in professional development once a week. Prof Brendan O'Leary, director of the programme in ethnic conflict at the University of Pennsylvania, says that a longer process might have worked better. But he says it was against a background when unprecedented changes were happening in Kurdish society as the region opened up to foreign investment. "The Kurdistan region is going through a difficult and fast-paced transformation. "Ideally a long and rich discussion is needed to agree new institutional conditions to enable higher education to flourish in a region emerging from decades of destruction, war, genocide, internal fighting, academic isolation and lack of resources. "University and institutional reforms are more likely to succeed if all the stakeholders have clear ideas on what to do, when, and at what pace. One should not be surprised if people with vested interests fear reforms," said Prof O'Leary. Thomas Hill, assistant professor at New York University Center for Global Affairs, adds: "I do not believe there is consensus even now that the reforms the former minister wanted to implement would have been in the best interest of the Kurdistan region. "There are many, many people with very conservative views within the higher education sector in the Kurdistan region and many did not and do not like the progressive path the former minister was plotting." There were areas in which vested interests remained unmoved. Prof Ala'Aldeen could not increase the independence of universities. The government continues to choose university leaders and universities have been totally dependent on government funding. Prof Ala'Aldeen put together draft legislation on institutional autonomy, but says the challenge to the status quo was too great to push it through. He is in close touch with the current government and is pleased that the reforms to improve quality have been maintained, despite the fact that there is still not consensus in favour of them, and says the scholarship programme is already making a difference. "Almost 3,000 students have studied abroad, the majority in the UK. Half of these are or will be back by the end of this year. They will provide leadership and bring a breath of fresh air. They will link their institutions to the outside world and break Kurdistan's academic isolation." Although Kurdistan has its own particular circumstances, Prof Ala'Aldeen says that the problems facing the university system are not unique - and that the model for modernisation could be applied elsewhere in the Middle East. "The problems are generic and the solutions can be implemented anywhere in the world." Commentators on Kurdistan's politics agree. Prof O'Leary says: "The Kurdistan region, Iraq and several other states in the Middle East are going through dramatic changes, and in some cases, deeply regrettable authoritarian restorations. "Most institutions are highly politicised in these societies. If the Kurdistan region can successfully reform its education system, including higher education, it can provide a model for the wider Middle East." </body>

      <title>Harvard plans to boldly go with 'Spocs'</title>
      <description>Harvard develops the next big thing for online learning. Is this the real deal?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24166247</url>

      <body>Keep up, keep up. If you've only just caught on to the concept of online university courses called Moocs, then you're in danger of falling behind again. Harvard, one of the world's most influential universities, is moving on to Spocs - which stands for small private online courses. Nothing to do with Star Trek and sombre Vulcans, but plenty to do with ambitions "to boldly go". And could these be the real deal? The academic chairing Harvard's online experiments says we are already "post-Mooc". Moocs - massive open online courses - have been something of a hurricane in universities, making a lot of noise and promising to rip everything up. Pioneered by some of the most prestigious US universities, they have been re-packaging course units into online lessons and making them available to anyone with an internet connection. But it's still not clear whether this is a passing storm or something that will fundamentally change how higher education is delivered. Last week the UK joined the fray, with more than 20 universities launching an online platform called FutureLearn, which will challenge the dominant players on the east and west US coasts. The biggest success for online courses and their greatest problem are the same - the huge numbers attracted. It demonstrates the scale of the unmet demand for higher education, but at the same time it's not clear how tens of thousands of students on a course could ever satisfactorily be taught, assessed and accredited. Most of these signs-up will sign off without completing courses. At Harvard, more people have signed up for Moocs in a single year than have attended the university in its entire 377-year history. That's a great success story in opening up education, but what do you do with all those hungry minds? Enter the Spoc. And the clue is in the "small, private" part of the name. These courses are still free and delivered through the internet, but access is restricted to much smaller numbers, tens or hundreds, rather than tens of thousands. It means a selection process for applicants and the capacity for a more customised experience. Looking further down the track, it wouldn't be difficult to imagine fees and course credits. Harvard and University of California, Berkeley, part of the edX online alliance with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, are among the universities beginning to experiment with this more refined model. Next week a popular and highly topical course in US national security strategy will begin at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Alongside the campus students in Cambridge, Massachusetts, there will be a parallel Spoc version with a limit of about 500 online students. Students wanting to get into this online classroom have to submit a written assignment about the US government's response to the conflict in Syria, along with details of their academic credentials. Even though this online course won't have a formal academic credit at the end, it's going to require eight hours of work a week and a capacity to tackle questions about "Iran's nuclear ambitions, the slaughter in Syria's civil war, WikiLeaks and the publication of classified information". These Spoc students might include Harvard students who couldn't get into the campus course, alongside those who might be studying from home or at work. Harvard isn't abandoning Moocs, but rather like Russian dolls sitting inside each other, a single course might now be delivered to a large open Mooc audience, to a much smaller number of Spoc students and then down to an even smaller number enrolled at the bricks-and-mortar campus. It's taking the limited and expensive resource of a Harvard course and amplifying it for widening rings of audiences. Prof Robert Lue chairs the committee of academics that runs Harvard's online experiments, under the banner of HarvardX. He describes the current online learning experiments as a "remarkable moment of possibility". And he sees the move towards more flexible and refined formats such as Spocs as an "almost inevitable evolution". "The Mooc represents just the first version of what we can do with online education," says Prof Lue. And this first version has now been overtaken. "We're already in a post-Mooc era." "What has become very clear is that the engagement you get from a very large group with a wide-ranging set of priorities can be radically different from what you get from a more focused group," says Prof Lue. It also paves the way to tackling one of the biggest problems for Moocs. How can they provide formally-recognised qualifications? The smaller class size will allow "much more rigorous assessment and greater validation of identity and that will be more closely tied to what kind of certification might be possible," he says. "It's safe to say that in the quite near term there will be announcements of experiments in this area." There are voices of caution about over-hyped expectations for online learning. A report published last week by the UK's Department for Business, Innovation and Skills suggested there remained many uncertainties over Moocs. The lack of a clear business model was described as a "burning issue". The edX project is in the fortunate position of being given $60m by Harvard and MIT, but few universities have the resources to give away so much expensively-produced content and staff time. Prof Lue suggests that the really tough questions raised by Moocs are not only about online learning but about what it means for the rest of the traditional campus. "What is it that a student gets out of being on campus and being in the classroom?" If students on campus prefer learning online, what does it mean for the funding model for universities? What happens if a recorded online lecture is preferable to a mediocre live talk? How do universities show their "added value"? Prof Lue argues that the significance of Spocs is that online learning is now moving beyond trying to replicate classroom courses and is trying to produce something that is more flexible and more effective. Universities that ignore such developments, or think that Moocs can just be showreels for conventional courses, are putting themselves at risk, he suggests. "The really big questions for university are about what students get from the classroom, what works, what could be done better." "Institutions that sit back and watch, they may be in trouble. One can imagine a large institution where there isn't much difference between online and classroom - and then you'd be silly not to realise there's a problem." </body>

      <title>UK enters online university race</title>

      <body>The UK's biggest online university project has been launched, with more than 20 universities offering free courses. Students will be able to follow courses on mobile phones as well as computers. The UK's project, called FutureLearn, sees UK universities entering the global market in so-called Moocs - massive open online courses. It could "revolutionise conventional models of formal education", says universities minister David Willetts. Mr Willetts, speaking at the British Library, said that the expansion of access to higher education was no longer necessarily about "bricks and mortar". He said that the FutureLearn partnership would help to serve the unmet demand for university courses, particularly overseas. The launch of FutureLearn sees 21 UK universities, plus Trinity College Dublin and Monash University in Australia, offering courses that are taught and assessed on the internet. The UK universities include Birmingham, Sheffield, Leeds, Nottingham, Warwick, Bristol, Reading, Southampton and the Open University, which has headed the project. The British Library, British Museum and British Council will make material available to students. There are 20 short courses announced, with eight starting this year. In this experimental phase, students taking these courses will carry out multiple choice questions, without any formal qualifications. But universities are hoping that many people will be attracted by the chance to follow university-level courses without any travel or cost and at a time that suits them. It will also provide taster courses for youngsters considering their university options. When the University of Edinburgh offered Moocs through a US network it had more than 300,000 students signing up. The University of London international programme had more than 200,000 registrations. FutureLearn will see the UK taking a much bigger step into the rapidly expanding online university market - with claims that higher education is now facing its own online revolution. They are anticipating that each Mooc course will attract 20,000 students. Universities also see the project as a way of recruiting students to degree courses. Martin Bean, vice chancellor of the Open University, described it as a "digital storefront". But Mr Bean says he expects some universities to begin thinking about how to offer formal credits for Moocs. Reading University is going to offer a Mooc course about basic computer programming. "Offering free taster courses online is a no-brainer," says David Bell, the university's vice-chancellor. "Universities shouldn't be afraid to open up teaching and research, either in the UK or beyond. Learning never stops and as the economy's demand for higher skills rises, universities should be in the vanguard when it comes to providing new opportunities. "Making courses accessible online, on mobiles and tablets means that people can fit their studying around their lives, rather than their lives around study." Southampton University is offering a course in web science, Leicester University's course looks at England at the time of Richard III and the University of Warwick has a psychology course. FutureLearn's chief executive Simon Nelson says it will offer a "fresh approach" with all its courses designed to work across all kinds of online platforms, so that a student could begin a course on a laptop at home and then continue on a mobile phone while commuting. He also promises a less isolated experience for students learning at home. He says that it can be a "solitary experience", but that FutureLearn will try to create a supportive online community, with "very strong social architecture". This will allow students to discuss their courses and ask questions, using social networking-style comment pages alongside the lesson content. This consortium will also draw upon the experience in distance learning of the Open University. "Time and again we have seen the disruptive impact the internet can have on industries - driving innovation and enhancing the customer experience. I have no doubt Moocs will do the same for education," says Mr Bean. There were also suggestions from the Department for Education last week that Moocs could be used for vocational courses for students in further education colleges and sixth forms in England. Moocs have already had a major impact in the US, launching last year and spearheaded by alliances of top institutions, including Harvard, MIT and Stanford. Coursera, set up by Stanford academics in California and backed by venture capital, has signed up more than four million students in its first 18 months for courses provided by more than 80 universities. These projects have revealed a high level of demand for courses, but also exposed the difficulty in retaining students, with very high levels of drop-out rates. It has sparked a debate about the cost of higher education and what students are paying for when so much information and so many high-quality university materials are available online. These US online courses have begun to develop ways of giving students formal credits, such as students paying to take invigilated exams. Among the Mooc pioneers has been the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), which set up the edX online platform with Harvard. On Tuesday, MIT announced a series of new online courses which will have an identity verification system using webcams and with plans for certification for courses. But there have also been questions asked about the long-term financial viability of online university courses. Last week, William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, challenged whether many universities could afford to invest in the type of free online courses offered by wealthy institutions such as Harvard and MIT. He suggested that online courses might work better as part of a "blended" course, where students spend some time together in the classroom as well as studying online. Sir Michael Barber, chief education adviser to Pearson and former Downing Street adviser, said that online universities represented an overdue technological advance. "The models of higher education that marched triumphantly across the globe in the second half of the 20th Century require radical and urgent transformation. My fear is that the nature of change is incremental and the pace of change too slow. "The establishment of FutureLearn represents an important step in realising this change and seizing the opportunities technology offers in creating a broader, deeper and more exciting education system." Universities and Science Minister David Willetts said: "I encourage all our institutions to explore the opportunities offered by new modes of technology, such as Moocs. This will keep the UK ahead in the global race to deliver education in worldwide markets." </body>

      <title>Gordon Brown's Syrian refugee school plan</title>
      <description>Syria's refugee crisis is also threatening to become a long-term education disaster.</description>

      <body>Syria's refugee crisis is threatening to become a long-term education disaster. There will soon be 500,000 refugee children in Lebanon, with few having access to school. But Gordon Brown, former UK prime minister and UN special envoy for global education, says that lessons could be in place in weeks. "A few days ago, global education campaigner Malala Yousafzai was able to speak over Skype to Zahra and Om Kolhtoum Katou, teenage Syrian twins exiled in Baalbeck in East Lebanon. As they talked, the three girls realised that they shared something in common. All three are victims of violence that threatened to destroy their youth and their future, and all three cannot do what most other girls and boys do every morning: leave the home in which they grew up and go to school. Now there is a plan that could help the biggest single group of Syrian child refugees - 300,000 of those exiled to Lebanon - which could see them in school and being fed within weeks. It has been prepared by Kevin Watkins of the Overseas Development Institute for the charity, A World at School, which campaigns to get an education for the millions of children without access to school. But this plan can only be put into practice - and this seems unlikely today - if the international community, which is financing just 2% of schooling needs in humanitarian crises, offers an additional $500m (£319m). The plan involves keeping Lebanese schools open day and night in a double or even triple shift system; hiring Syrian refugees as teachers in Arabic in community colleges; providing school meals to tackle hunger as we tackle illiteracy. This strategy is also rooted in the realistic presumption that the plight of the Syrian children is more than a short-term emergency: their exile could last years. It has the active support of the Lebanese government, but it is an open question as to whether the world community will put up the funds. Children are always the most neglected and forgotten victims of conflict. Already deprived of food and shelter, boys and girls are also denied their right to education, condemned to forfeit a childhood that, once lost, can never be re-run or re-lived. The one million Syrian children, who make up half of that country's refugees, are simply the most recent victims of this monumental gap in our global system. They are among 28 million children worldwide now being denied their right to schooling in conflict zones and under broken-down regimes. Soon small, unstable Lebanon will have absorbed 500,000 Syrian boys and girls. Already in just a few months, the refugees have grown in number to an astonishing 25% of Lebanon's child population. But today, and for the foreseeable future, there are school places for only a small fraction of them - just 30,000. If they suffer the typical exile of children in conflict they could spend 10 years in camps and without schooling. The traumas engulfing Syrian children underscores an enduring global failure. One hundred years ago, through support for the Red Cross, the world decided it would meet people's basic health needs, even in theatres of war. Forty years ago Médecins Sans Frontières established that healthcare should be available across the most dangerous and violent of war zones. Today, the concept of "Education Without Borders" still remains an unfamiliar idea, a concept yet to be built into our system of humanitarian relief. Yet the cost of inaction for young people deprived of an education, destroyed by anger, restlessness, and desperation and sentenced to tents and camps often for years, will haunt us for generations. Because these millions of young unemployed will become the adult unemployable, and many will graduate not into jobs but into violence. On 23 September in New York, organisations that have for years fought valiantly to deliver education in emergencies will build on pioneering work by UNICEF, UNHCR, UN Refugees and the Inter-Agency Network for Education in Emergencies (INEE) to bring to life the Education Without Borders initiative for Lebanon's Syrian refugees. In New York, young people from conflict zones around the world, joined by Malala and backed up by a petition presented to the UN Secretary General, will lead an appeal for funds. It will show that while we cannot do everything we can do something, that hope can survive even amid horror and that good can yet triumph over the worst evils, even in the most troubled and desperate parts of the world." </body>

      <title>Zombie apocalypse: The future of universities?</title>
      <description>A US university is going to create an online course based on the TV drama the Walking Dead.</description>

      <body>Can zombies be the stuff of serious academic study? And could they be shuffling towards a new type of future for higher education? In what is being claimed as the biggest ever experiment in "edutainment", a US television company is forming a partnership with a top-ranking Californian university to produce online courses linked to a hit TV show. This blurring of the digital boundaries between academic study and the entertainment industry will see a course being launched next month based on the post-apocalypse drama series the Walking Dead. Television shows might have spin-off video games or merchandising, but this drama about surviving disaster and social collapse is now going to have its own university course. Academics from the University of California, Irvine, who are setting up the online courses, say these will be academically rigorous and tackle serious scientific issues, related to events in the show. A physicist will look at the "science behind decay"; the public health department will use the series to study questions such as "What can we learn from past epidemics?" and maths lecturers will show how "post-calculus maths can be used to model population and epidemic dynamics". Showbiz lessons The show is made by AMC, which also produced cult series such as Mad Men, Breaking Bad and The Killing, and AMC vice-president Theresa Beyer says this showbiz-academic partnership will create a "legitimate educational experience". She says AMC will be the "first entertainment group to make the foray into the online education arena" and wants the course to "drive a deep, sustained connection with the show". The TV series has an audience of 10 million and student numbers for the online course are expected to be in the hundreds of thousands. If this experiment proves successful, the online platform provider, Instructure, suggests there could be further TV show and university hybrids. It's not difficult to imagine an advertising course being built around a series such as Mad Men, suggests Josh Coates, Instructure's chief executive. This partnership also marks another development in the rapidly-expanding world of MOOCs - the massive open online courses - an acronym sufficiently established to have made it into the Oxford online dictionary last week. Millions of students have signed up for online courses in the past year, suggesting the scale of demand for higher education. And millions of students have failed to complete those courses suggesting the scale of the challenge of online learning. Dumbing down? This eight-module course will begin in mid-October and will be accessible without charge to anyone with an internet connection. There will be online tests and discussion groups, but students taking the course will not get any formal qualifications or credits towards a degree, so it's going to be for students who want to follow the course in their own time. But isn't there a risk of dumbing down? The University of California, Irvine, has Nobel prize-winning researchers, it contributes $4.3bn (£2.77bn; 3.3bn euro) to the local economy, does it want to have zombies on its prospectus? "When we entered this partnership it was really important to make each of the modules as academically strong as they would be in our classes at UC Irvine," says Melissa Loble, associate dean of distance learning at the university. "The lessons will be academically rigorous and rich and still have connections to the show." Joanne Christopherson, social science lecturer, says that it's taking another step forward from how universities already use contemporary media examples. "In all of my classes I have to bring in current issues to keep it interesting. Not just because they're young adults coming out of high school, but because it's important to make these classic theories relevant to them. What we're doing is using this series as an example through the whole course." Apocalypse studies Josh Coates, head of Instructure, which provides the Canvas online platform, says it will present science and social science issues, using the hook of a TV show. "This is real curriculum about infectious diseases, public health, nutrition, psychology and sociology. The fact that the context is this fictional world of an apocalypse is incidental." "This is very topical. We have terrorist attacks, we have Katrina, Fukushima, all these things happen in our world today, which create small vignettes of a local apocalypse. This is an opportunity to educate people about the science of these disasters." Mr Coates says a significant part of this experiment will be to see if it can crack one of the biggest weaknesses of MOOCs, the high drop-out rate. Will the pulling power of television keep people switched on to learning? "Can we get more students through because it's linked to a TV show they really like?" he says. He describes the link between the university and the TV industry as the "cross-pollination" that comes with the internet. "The internet tears down walls of tradition and the isolation of different areas of research and interest," he says. Personal learning For the university, it's a shop window putting their brand in front of a global audience. It also allows them to refine the process of putting courses online. "The first MOOCs had great videos and great quizzes, but didn't help students really interact with one another," says Melissa Loble. "The next step for MOOCs is to figure how to make them personal without it being overwhelming for the institution trying to deliver that." These are the type of practical questions that come with the huge numbers of online students. Dr Christopherson says that scale of the demand for MOOCs has been a "wake-up call" for universities. But it remains a challenge to provide an online structure that can allow so many students to follow a course without feeling anonymous and disconnected. William Dutton, professor of internet studies at the University of Oxford, says there also remains a longer term question about the funding model for MOOCs. And he suggests that universities which have begun to invest in them might become wary at the extent of the drop-out rate. They might work better as part of a "blended" course, where there is a taught, classroom element as well as online study, he says. Spoiler alert Alan Smithers, director of the Centre for Education and Employment Research at the University of Buckingham, also has reservations about the value of TV-related online courses. Without formal assessment and personal content, he says it remains to be seen how this delivers more than a good television documentary. "The student must be able to sift the evidence. "For genuine learning, personal contact really matters," he says. Prof Smithers says such links with a popular TV show might work as a way of attracting students, but the academic element needs to outweigh the entertainment. But don't expect the march of the MOOCs to stop any time soon. And Mr Coates says he wants people to look back at the Walking Dead course as a watershed when education and entertainment connected. With the online course available globally and when different series are being shown at different stages in different countries, this could also be the first university course that has to come with its own spoiler alert. </body>

      <body>A survey of university backgrounds of heads of major global companies found that Harvard in the United States was the most likely place to have studied. The Times Higher Education magazine ranked the universities attended by chief executive officers of Fortune Global 500 companies. There are four US universities in the top 10, with three from France, two from Japan and one from South Korea. The highest ranked UK university is Oxford in 21st place. This league table, described as the Alma Mater Index, shows which universities around the world taught the bosses of some of the world's biggest companies. One in 20 had a degree from a single institution, Harvard. This included Margaret C Whitman of Hewlett-Packard, Jeffrey R Immelt of General Electric and Vittorio Colao of Vodafone. This academic powerhouse regularly appears at the top of university league tables, including the rich list, with an endowment worth $31bn (£20bn' 23.5bn euro). But the top 10 for producing business leaders does not contain all the usual names that appear at the top of university rankings. Oxford and Cambridge are absent, but the University of Pennsylvania in the US and Keio University in Japan are included, along with three French universities, headed by the Ecole Polytechnique. It means that in this top 10 cradles of global CEOs, there are two institutions from Paris, two from the Boston area and two from Tokyo. Across the top 100, universities from the US dominate, followed by universities in China, Japan, France and Germany. There are more CEOs who went to university in Asia than in Europe. In terms of national comparisons, UK universities produced the sixth highest number of global chief executives, with Oxford in 21st place and Cambridge in 45th place. But even though Harvard might have taught the biggest number of bosses from the top 500 companies, it was not attended by any of the heads of the biggest 10 companies, who were from a more diverse range of universities. Royal Dutch Shell is headed by a graduate of Zurich University of Applied Sciences; Wal-Mart is headed by a student of Georgia Tech and Exxon Mobil has a chief executive from the University of Texas, Austin. Three of the leaders of these biggest companies went to university in China and the head of Volkswagen went to university in Stuttgart. </body>

      <title>The scientists who escaped the Nazis</title>
      <description>A first-hand memory of the scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany</description>

      <body>When Gustav Born's family were advised in early 1933 that it was time to leave Nazi-controlled Germany, it was from a good authority. The advice was from Albert Einstein, who told his friend and fellow scientist Max Born to "leave immediately" with his family while they were still able to travel. They packed their bags and headed across the border, first to Italy and then to England, where they arrived as part of what must have been the best-qualified refugee trail in history. Gustav Born was 11 at the time, living in Gottingen, Lower Saxony, where his father, Max, was director of one of the world's leading centres for physics research. The Borns were Jewish, and when Hitler took power, Max Born and his Jewish colleagues were prevented from working at the university. This pioneering, elite group of theoretical scientists were turned into asylum seekers. Gustav now lives in London, a few days short of his 92nd birthday, and he looks back with great clarity on the remarkable flight of these German academics. The conversation is like opening a 1930s Mitteleuropa time capsule. He is now one of the last living links to these academic refugees, who between them went on to win 16 Nobel prizes - his father received the award for his work in quantum mechanics. Did these scientists realise the extent of the threat from the Nazis? "Yes, I think my father probably did. Among his Jewish colleagues, some did, but some didn't believe for some time. But the scale of what the Nazis were doing became apparent in the first three to six months." Gustav remembers that the ugly mood of anti-Semitism had even reached the playground, with some children not allowed to play with him. There were also positive examples of human nature, such as the academics who stood by their Jewish colleagues. The Nobel prize winner Max von Laue showed great support, says Gustav. The physicist Max Planck went to see Hitler in person to challenge the exclusion of Jewish scientists, but Hitler "foamed at the mouth and wouldn't let him talk any more". It was still tough to leave. Max Born had to give up running an institute, his wife was heartbroken at the prospect of emigrating. "They hated to be uprooted in this crude and dangerous way." When the Borns left, they were not under any illusions that this would be a temporary departure. "Nazification" was happening rapidly and there were political murders. "My parents were pretty sure this was a one-way journey." While the Borns were watching the swastikas appearing in Gottingen, a much more tweedily humanitarian response was being marshalled by university staff in Britain. The economist William Beveridge had set up the Academic Assistance Council, with the aim of rescuing Jewish and politically vulnerable academics. It was an organisation that would help 1,500 academics escape Germany and continue their research work in safety in Britain. It was quickly backed by academics whose names now read like a row of text books - J B S Haldane, John Maynard Keynes, Ernest Rutherford, G M Trevelyan and the poet A E Housman. Albert Einstein supported this high-brow escape committee with a highly-charged speech in the Albert Hall in London in October 1933. He set out an epic defence of Western liberal values of "tolerance and justice" against the "temptations of hatred and oppression", at a time of deepening extremism and economic and political turmoil. "It is in times of economic distress such as we experience everywhere today, one sees very clearly the strength of the moral forces that live in a people." He told his audience that it was "the liberty of the individual that has brought us every advance of knowledge and invention - liberty without which life to a self-respecting man is not worth living". The council launched its "rescue operation", arranging for academics to come to Britain and providing practical support in the form of grants, accommodation and most importantly jobs. This was a remarkably talented group being cast aside by the Nazis. As well as the trawl of Nobel prizes, there were 18 future knighthoods and over 100 fellows of the Royal Society or British Academy. According to the Association of Jewish Refugees there were about 70,000 Jewish refugees who came to Britain before the outbreak of war in 1939. Max Born and his family went first to Cambridge and then to Edinburgh University. He paid his way by writing a science text book that became a school standard. There were others who moved on to the United States. Mathematician Richard Courant went to New York where one of the foremost centres for applied maths, the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, is named after him. Losing such intellectual powerhouses was a self-inflicted wound for the Nazi war effort. In the race to develop atomic weapons, German refugees played a key role in making sure that it was the United States that won. Even though Max Born refused on moral grounds to work on atomic weapons research, Robert Oppenheimer, the US-born "father of the atomic bomb", had been Born's PhD student at Gottingen. There were signs at one stage that the Nazis might have realised their mistake. In 1934, Max Born and his family were visited in Cambridge by Werner Heisenberg, another Nobel prize winner and old colleague who had continued working at Gottingen. Heisenberg brought a message from the Nazi government inviting Max Born to return to continue his scientific work in Germany. The invitation left Born "beside himself with fury", his son recalls. But Max Born and his wife did eventually go back to Germany, after the war was over and after he had retired. He died there in 1970 and is buried in the same cemetery in Gottingen as Max Planck and Max von Laue. Gustav, who became a professor of pharmacology at King's College London, says that his parents were committed to trying to rebuild Germany in a way that would prevent the return of such political extremism. What lessons should be learned from all this? Gustav Born remains a strong supporter of the campaign to rescue academics, which is now marking its 80th year. It has become the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics (Cara) and its current chair, Anne Lonsdale, says that after 80 years the organisation "would love to be out of a job", but the problems in Zimbabwe, Iran, Iraq and Syria mean that academics still need help in places where "civil society no longer functions". There is an "urgent need for scholars from across the Middle East to get to exile in a place of safety", she said. The stories of refugees from the Nazis, with grainy photos of faces with lines like old railway maps of Europe, might seem like something from a lost world. But Gustav Born says that Cara's ongoing work shows that it is as relevant as ever. It is also a reminder not to make hasty judgements about refugees and what they might be able to achieve. His descriptions of that academic world of the 1930s are also a last glimpse of a highly cultured society. His father, remembered for his science research, played Bach on the piano every day. These were internationalists, their ideas and research moving across national and political boundaries. Such a world proved fragile in the face of the Nazis. And Gustav Born says people can too often overlook that Germany had still been a young country in the 1930s, little more than 60 years old, and that it hadn't built the institutions able to resist its own "militaristic and nationalistic" tendencies. He is very much aware that he is now one of the few remaining people who can talk first-hand about such a legacy. "I'm sad that it almost ends with me. "I want them not to forget that things like this, the suppression of a country by a gang of murderous crooks and the victimisation of people of good nature and good intention, it could happen again." </body>

      <title>Education is a 'security issue', says UN</title>
      <description>Unesco chief says even though pledge for education for all will be missed, huge progress has been achieved.</description>

      <body>The tinderbox mix of high youth unemployment, lack of education and the threat of extremism is turning access to school into a "security issue", says Irina Bokova, director general of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation. The volatile prospect of millions of uneducated, illiterate youngsters in developing countries, under pressure from the financial downturn, has brought an unprecedented political significance to the campaign to give every child a primary school education, she says. Ms Bokova was speaking ahead of a speech later this week at the United Nations from Malala Yousafzai, who will call for all children to have the right to go to school. The Pakistani schoolgirl, who will make her speech in New York on her 16th birthday, defied the bullets of the Taliban in defence of her right to an education. But behind the optimism of Malala's campaign and the creation of an annual "Malala Day" is a much more complex global story, with failure as well as success. In 2000, in the warm glow of a new millennium, world leaders pledged that universal primary education would be achieved by 2015. No child would miss out on the basics of schooling. After an initial surge, progress stalled and achieving the target in the next 18 months now seems unlikely. "By 2015, it's impossible," says Ms Bokova, the Paris-based head of Unesco. But she says that rather than being a cause of pessimism, the pursuit of the target has brought "huge progress". There were 108 million children out of school when the pledge was made; the most recent figures suggest this has fallen to 57 million. "If the right strategies are in place, and you put your head where your heart is, then things can be improved. In Afghanistan in 2000 only 4% of girls were in school, now there are more than 70%." Ms Bokova says that another positive outcome has been a much stronger recognition of the importance of measuring the quality of education, rather than simply counting heads going into a classroom. Among the more sobering discoveries has been that many pupils have spent years in school but remained functionally illiterate. So in the autumn, Unesco is planning to produce a new set of global metrics to measure what's actually being learned in primary classrooms around the world. "It will give a global understanding of what quality education means," says Ms Bokova. It remains unclear whether there will be more targets after 2015, but anything that emerges will be more about quality of education, rather than simply volume of places. Ms Bokova says the financial crisis delivered a major blow to achieving the goal of universal primary education. Donor countries pulled the plug and left an "alarming gap" in funding. In sub-Saharan Africa there remains a shortage of 1.7 million teachers. But despite this gloom, she says that the financial crisis has given education a "paradoxical" political importance. Youth unemployment is a major threat in many countries and education and training are seen as vital investments. "Education is now becoming in some cases a security issue," she says, with examples such as Afghanistan, Iraq and across the Middle East, where there is huge pressure to provide education to promote stability and democracy and to avoid extremism. "The same is true of big emerging powers. In Brazil, the government recognises that the education system is one of the biggest challenges as it moves forward to a competitive economy and an inclusive society." The social tensions of deepening inequality and a lack of social mobility are also shaped by decisions about education systems, she says. Economic and political stability are now inextricably linked to improving education, says the Bulgarian-born Unesco director general. "Education is becoming the key issue now in discussions about overcoming the economic crisis. "But how are we going to make this happen? Budgets and international aid are shrinking. "We try to convince countries that if they want to invest in coming out of the crisis, then invest in education." Another barrier to getting all children to school is a lack of fair access, particularly for girls. Ms Bokova says it's not acceptable for countries to hide behind ideas of "cultural differences" or "tradition" as a reason for discriminating against girls. Malala Yousafzai has become a powerful emblem. "One event can spark a huge reaction and understanding and I think it was the case with Malala," she says. "It was a stunning example of courage and a desire to learn." And she says that getting more girls into school is the single most important goal. "It's not just a human right, it's what is needed to have normal societies. If a girl goes to school, she is less likely to have an early marriage, she will have healthier children, she'll find it easier to earn an income, she's less likely to be subjected to violence, less likely to have an early pregnancy. "There are so many advantages, healthier communities, less violence, more economic growth. It has such an incredible multiplying effect. "This is the best thing that could happen to humanity." The pledge for education for all has also highlighted where the problem is most acute. A meeting organised by the UN in April brought together eight countries - Bangladesh, DR Congo, Ethiopia, Haiti, India, Nigeria, South Sudan and Yemen - which between them have about half the children in the world who are missing out on school. It was an unprecedented attempt to systematically work out what has been going wrong. A minister from the DR Congo said that about 60% of those missing out on school did so because of the cost of school fees with the other 40% blamed on armed conflict. In Ethiopia the problem was identified as being focused on rural communities and lack of access for girls. In South Sudan it was a lack of trained teachers and a low level of school participation among girls. In Nigeria, which has the most children out of school, the difficulty was not necessarily about money, but was caused by low participation among girls in some areas and problems with "infrastructure" about providing teachers. Weaknesses in state authorities delivering the plans of the national government were also blamed. The country has also seen brutal attacks on schools. Secondary schools in Nigeria's north-eastern state of Yobe were ordered to close this week after a massacre in which suspected Islamist extremists killed 22 students. Ms Bokova says that there is now a willingness among such countries to recognise what needs to be changed. Despite the failure to make the 2015 deadline, she says the attempt has shown the international community what can be achieved. Countries such as India and Ethiopia have taken substantial steps forward. This has disproved the feeling that "education is too complex, too costly and it takes too long to show results". But there is no escaping the harsh truth that millions of children, born a decade after the world promised universal primary education, still won't have even the most basic access to school. It's been possible to launch hundreds of satellites and put a spacecraft on Mars, but not to put children into classrooms a few hours south of Heathrow. "In many cases we have failed, but it shouldn't discourage us. We're winning the argument." </body>

      <title>Why we're afraid of 'zombie' faces</title>
      <description>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist.</description>

      <body>The horror-film appeal of zombies is rooted in an instinctive disquiet at faces that are almost human, says a psychologist. A research project by the Open University's Stephanie Lay found a particular fear of "near-human" faces. It explains why blank eyes, automatons, masks and ventriloquists' dolls are common cinema devices to instil fear. The psychologist says a study of 3,000 people found widespread "repulsion" at near-human faces. The finding is part of research into the so-called "uncanny valley" phenomenon in how people react to robots. The effect was discovered in the 1970s in research into whether giving robots human features would make them more reassuring to humans working with them or using them in the home. The research found that people were initially more receptive to robots which were made slightly human looking, but if they began to imitate humans too closely, people were repelled. Instead of being reassured, too close a resemblance to a human form was seen as sinister. Mrs Lay's research is examining this "uncanny valley" effect from a psychological perspective. She describes it as "the sense of unease that accompanies the sight of something almost, but not quite, human". It is the sudden plunge in reaction at a point just before a face is fully humanised. For instance the empty eyes of a zombie figure in an otherwise human face is highly disconcerting. And it explains why the faces of dolls, clowns and dummies are used so regularly to frighten audiences. "A consistent finding of the survey was people's reactions to images where the face was convincingly human but with lifeless eyes or where eerily human eyes appeared in a non-human face," says Mrs Lay. "These were perceived to be the most uncanny and disturbing of all the images and explain why characters such as zombies in horror films unsettle people to such great effect." This is particularly the case with psychological horror films, she says, rather than bloodthirsty shockers. She says this uneasy reaction could be caused by the sudden disruption in how the human brain processes human faces. When people begin to interpret something as a human face, they are left with a sense of disquiet when they come against something that does not match their expectations. Being able to "read" another person's eyes is particularly important in this process of interpreting faces, she says. "It may be that our normal processing mechanisms are not being engaged for these faces, causing the unsettling effect when people want to like a near-human face, but realise something is wrong." </body>

      <title>David Beckham inspires philosophy</title>

      <body>A new branch of thought, Becksistentialism, will be brought before the public by Cambridge University this week. David Beckham's imagined philosophical awakening during his time with Paris Saint Germain will be highlighted during the Cambridge Festival of Ideas. For its inventor Dr Andy Martin, Becksistentialism is "existentialism but with a very cool haircut". The lecture will be based on Dr Martin's blog, Becks in Paris. The blog "imagines Beckham's internal monologue as he collides with the Parisian intellectual tradition - the glittering surface of a footballing icon cracked open by existentialism. Golden boy deconstructed." Dr Martin, a lecturer in French philosophy at Cambridge University, began writing it after the former England star signed with Paris Saint Germain on a five-month deal before retiring from the game in May. Beckham was reaching a turning point, reasoned Dr Martin. Would he succumb to ideas of existentialist angst, meaninglessness and absurdity as defined by great French writers such as Sartre? Or would he find "the best of all possible worlds" like Voltaire's Candide? "I found myself identifying with Beckham, having lived myself in Paris in bygone days. As an east Londoner and having once captained a regional amateur team, I always felt if I hadn't got into philosophy I could have been a footballer," he told BBC News. "I could imagine myself living the life he was living in Paris. "It is impossible for a reasonably intelligent guy like Beckham not to have had some sort of revelatory encounter while he was there." Dr Martin says links between philosophy and football go beyond the personal. "Derrida used to follow Paris Saint Germain. "Philosophy aspires to the condition of football." He points out that Albert Camus, author of The Outsider and The Plague, once played in goal and that 2013 is the centenary of his birth. "Philosophy came to him as a kind of substitute when he was forced to give up football by tuberculosis. "Being an existentialist is normal. "It gives you a guide to life and a way to understand how you have screwed up. "Everything always goes wrong - and if you think about the England football team over the past few decades you can hardly disagree." He imagines the crises that Beckham may have been through during his football career, starting with his sending off during the 1998 World Cup: "I was at that game." Dr Martin regards the midfielder "as an exemplar or embodiment of a number of philosophical propositions" about crisis, conflict and identity. "The thing about Beckham is that he doesn't say much so you have to be a subtle interpreter of signs. "He has this ability to reinvent himself time and again - and every time he pops up his hair is different - a signal of his mutability. "My basic hypothesis to get into the soul of Beckham is to echo Descartes and to think that he thinks. "He couldn't be seen carrying a book as that would shatter his image but maybe he looked at The Outsider on his phone while he was in Paris." Dr Martin sees Beckham as having taken a similar journey to Voltaire's Candide, who starts out as the ultimate optimist but is forced by life to take a more complex view. "If you look beyond the shiny surface you find complexities which existentialism brings out and dramatises." The lecture, Becksistentialism, is one of 200 events planned for the Festival of Ideas which begins in Cambridge on Wednesday. </body>

      <title>Call to drop term-time holiday ban</title>
      <description>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking term-time holidays, will be delivered to the government on Wednesday.</description>

      <body>A petition demanding the government reverse a ban on schoolchildren in England taking holidays during term-time will be delivered later. The 126,000-signature document will be given to the Department for Education. Campaigners say many families cannot afford the higher cost of a break during the school holidays. The DfE said it was giving schools more freedom to set term dates - potentially meaning parents could book cheaper holidays. Until last month, heads could grant up to 10 days' leave a year for family holidays in "special circumstances". Since 1 September, head teachers have no longer been able to grant any absence outside school holidays except under "exceptional circumstances". The reference to the 10-day limit has been removed from the regulations. A petition against the ban, started by a parent and hosted on the 38-Degrees Campaigns By You website, had attracted 126,275 signatures by Tuesday evening. The petition says the ban will "adversely affect" families who cannot afford the higher prices charged to holidaymakers during the school holidays. "Also not all businesses can allow their staff to be off all at the same time", says the petition. "All children who have a good attendance record should be allowed the opportunity to enjoy quality time with their parents on an annual holiday of up to 10 days once per year." Craig Langman, the parent who started the petition, told BBC News his six-year-old son still recalls a holiday the family took to Rome during term-time two years ago and has done school projects based on the trip. "It was probably more educational than being in school to be honest. "He still remembers the Palatine Hill and the Colosseum." Mr Langman says the cost of breaks during the school holidays can be three times as much as during term-time. "I am not asking kids to have a guaranteed extra two weeks on top of their existing 10 weeks' holiday each year - but this blanket ban on term-time holidays with the threat of a fine is almost killing families." He argues that the decision as to whether to grant a request for extra days off school should remain with head teachers. "I feel that most MPs in the government had holidays with their parents when they were younger so why do they think they have the power to stop our children's generation from enjoying the same lifestyle," says Mr Langman. "Soon only rich kids would be able to go on holiday and that's unfair on everyone else." A DfE spokesperson said: "If children aren't in school they lose out on valuable learning time and have to waste more time catching up. That's why children shouldn't be taken out of school during term time unless absolutely necessary. "We are giving all schools the freedom to set their own term dates, for example David Young Community Academy in Leeds operates a seven-term year starting in June. This means that parents and teachers can benefit from cheaper holidays at the end of September. "We want schools to consider changes to term dates that will work for their pupils and their families." </body>

      <title>Extra marks for exam illness up 10%</title>
      <description>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because pupils had problems such as a minor illness.</description>

      <body>Almost 3% of this summer's exam papers were given extra marks because of pupils having problems such as a temporary illness, the highest level on record. The figures from exam regulator Ofqual showed a 10% increase in such cases in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. There were 374,000 requests approved for "special consideration" in marking this summer's GCSEs and A-levels. The most common adjustment was worth 3% of the maximum exam mark. The figures from Ofqual show that there was an even higher level of requests from schools for such special consideration - rising by 13% on the previous year to 415,200. Only about 10% of these requests were rejected. The extra marks are allowed because an exam candidate has faced an unexpected disadvantage, which could range from a minor illness to something more serious, such as a bereavement. The exam regulator describes the criteria as "temporary injury, illness, indisposition or another unforeseen incident immediately before or during the exam's period". It could also allow a student to receive a grade reflecting their ability if they were unable to attend an exam. The maximum adjustment is 5%, such as a close family bereavement. A "minor illness on the day of the exam" could gain a pupil an extra 2%. As well as these adjustments for unexpected problems, Ofqual says that candidates taking a further 209,900 exam papers were given special access arrangements because of a disability or a medical condition. These numbers of special access cases are falling, both in terms of request and approvals. But the most common request remains asking for an extra 25% time for candidates, which was allowed for 107,400 exam papers. Other types of help included using a reading device or someone to act as a scribe, such as for people with problems with their sight. The exam report from Ofqual also shows a sharp year-on-year rise in penalties on staff for "malpractice" in exams, up 62% to 97, although this was lower than in 2011. The most common type of staff malpractice was giving "inappropriate assistance to candidates" and the most common penalty was a written warning. There were also 135 penalties for exam malpractice for schools and colleges, almost all of which were written warnings. Among pupils, there were 2,590 penalties from this summer's exams - similar to last year. The most common form of cheating was using "unauthorised material", which usually meant a mobile phone. But there have been declining numbers caught trying to use mobiles - down for the fourth consecutive year to 814 cases. </body>

      <title>Neets are 'public health time bomb'</title>
      <description>Youth unemployment in the UK is a "public health time bomb waiting to explode", according to a review by the World Health Organisation.</description>

      <body>Youth unemployment in the UK is a "public health time bomb waiting to explode", according to a review by the World Health Organisation. It warned of the health consequences of high numbers of Neets - people not in employment, education or training. More than one million 16 to 24-year-olds in the UK are classed as Neet. The report also said the UK was behind other European countries on female life expectancy, deaths of children under five and child poverty. The WHO and the University College London Institute of Health Equity analysed the reasons for differences in life expectancy across Europe. For the UK, it highlighted the dangers of young people being out of work. Wealth is tightly linked to life expectancy and is one of the major reasons for the north-south health divide in the UK. Being unemployed has immediate health consequences, including an increased risk of depression and suicide. Being out of work in the longer term increases the risk of chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease and stroke. Prof Sir Michael Marmot, who led the review, said: "Unemployment may be falling in the UK, but persistent high levels of the number of young people over 18 not in employment, education or training is storing up a public health time bomb waiting to explode." The length of the fuse is thought to be 10 to 20 years. The report said women and children in Spain, Italy and Cyprus would fare better than those in the UK. It said life expectancy for women was 83 years in the UK, behind Spain and France at 85 and Germany at 84. The report added that mortality rates in the under-fives were higher than most countries in the west of Europe and even some eastern European nations, including the Czech Republic and Slovenia. Figures also showed that one in four children in the UK live in poverty - a figure higher than other countries such as Iceland, Cyprus and Ireland. Prof Marmot said: "We are failing too many of our children, women and young people on a grand scale. "I would say to any government that cares about the health of its population: look at the impact of their policies on the lives people are able to lead and, more importantly, at the impact on inequality. "Health inequality, arising from social and economic inequalities, is socially unjust, unnecessary and avoidable, and it offends against the human right to health." Prof John Ashton, the president of the Faculty of Public Health, said: "Michael Marmot is absolutely right that the number of 'Neets' is a public health time bomb. "There is a lot of evidence to show that being out of work is bad your health. "It is disgraceful that a generation of young people are growing up in a world when unemployment is the norm, not the exception." The Department for Work and Pensions said it was "really encouraging" that the numbers of young people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance was falling, but "we're not complacent - we'll continue to do everything possible to give young people the best chance in life". A Government spokesperson said health inequality was taken "very seriously". In a statement they said: "The Chief Medical Officer raised this issue in her recent report on children's health, outlining the need to invest early in our young people to give them good foundations and the best start in life. "We have already successfully protected the poorest from falling behind and last year we saw a reduction of 100,000 children in workless poor families. In addition, we are training an extra 4,200 health visitors by 2015, and 16,000 of the most vulnerable families will be helped by family nurses." </body>

      <title>Grades for tougher apprenticeships</title>
      <description>A new type of high-quality apprenticeship is to be introduced in England, with different grades of ability, rather than pass or fail.</description>

      <body>A new type of high-quality apprenticeship is to be introduced in England, with apprentices being awarded different grades according to ability. These tougher apprenticeships were unveiled by Prime Minister David Cameron on a visit to BMW's Mini car plant in Oxford. They will be offered by 60 firms from next year and will run in parallel with existing apprenticeships. Mr Cameron promised the "best apprenticeships in the world". The new apprenticeships are designed to raise the quality of the schemes and make them more straightforward for employers. They are being brought in as a response to the Richard Review last year which called for the status and quality of apprenticeships to be much more clearly defined. Apprentices completing their training will be graded as either pass, merit or distinction, giving a clearer impression of their level of achievement, rather than a simple pass or fail. The new apprenticeships will be based on "rigorous independent assessment", with at least two thirds of the assessment taking place at the end of the training. Training will have to last at least one year and must include at least 20% time away from where the apprentice is working. There are also plans for apprentices to have English and maths at a level equivalent to a good GCSE. The new system, beginning from the end of 2014, will be shaped around the needs of employers in specific sectors. These will be aerospace, automotive, digital industries, electro-technical, energy, financial services, food and drink, and life and industrial sciences. Among the firms supporting the plans are Airbus, Rolls Royce, BMW, Ford, Toyota, Microsoft, British Gas, Barclays, Unilever and GSK. "The reforms we're announcing today will put employers in the driving seat and ensure that we deliver rigorous training that supports you and our economy for years to come," said Mr Cameron. "I think apprenticeships can be a big part not just of tackling unemployment but also in making sure our recovery is for all. "We've seen 1.5 million people start apprenticeships under this government, I want to make sure the apprenticeships are good quality so we are announcing new rules today to make sure that happens." But Labour's shadow skills minister, Liam Byrne, said the proposals "don't go far enough". "The number of apprenticeship starts is falling at a time when youth unemployment stands at nearly a million. According to the government's own research, one in five apprentices report receiving neither on- or off-the-job training as part of their apprenticeship, and 29% of apprentices receive less pay than they are legally entitled to," said Mr Byrne. The national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, John Allan, said: "These schemes should be recognised as vital introductions to careers that can take an individual all the way to the top in the business. "We hope the reforms announced today will strengthen and protect the image of apprenticeships which, over the years, has been damaged by constant change." The reforms were welcomed by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development as a step towards making such vocational training becoming "as equally an attractive prospect to young people and their parents as a university education". Adam Marshall, policy director at the British Chambers of Commerce said: "Empowering employers to set standards for apprenticeships is a positive step forward." But while welcoming an increased emphasis on quality, Dr Marshall warned that a "one-size-fits-all approach will not work". The Association of Employment and Learning Providers warned that the changes might work better for large employers and warned that the grading system was not "appropriate" and could create too much bureaucracy. </body>

      <title>Internet chat 'has a positive side'</title>
      <description>Experts say there should be greater focus on the positive effect internet forums and chatrooms can have.</description>

      <body>Internet forums and chatrooms can have positive effects that should be more widely acknowledged, experts say. The call comes after Oxford University researchers carried out an analysis of 14 different studies looking at how young people use the internet. The review - published in the Plos One journal - said a number of studies had found a link between internet use and self-harm and suicide. But it said others had found the internet could be a positive influence. The dangers of internet use have received widespread coverage this year. In one case, in August, 14-year-old Hannah Smith from Leicestershire was found hanged after she had been sent abusive messages on a social networking site. Since then research by the NSPCC has suggested a fifth of 11 to 16-year-olds have had negative experiences using the internet. The Oxford University research highlighted a number of dangers from internet use, including the normalising of self-harm and the risk of bullying. It also said there was a "strong link" between internet forums and an increased risk of suicide in particular. But the researchers said some studies had shown that internet forums could support and connect socially isolated people. There were also examples where forum users encouraged positive behaviour, advised others to seek help and congratulated each other for not harming themselves. Report author Prof Keith Hawton said: "Communication via the internet and other electronic means has potential roles in both contributing to and preventing suicidal behaviour in young people. "The next step is going to be development of therapeutic interventions using these channels of communication, especially to access those who do not seek help from clinical services." Joe Ferns of the Samaritans added: "We should acknowledge that many people are using suicide forums and chatrooms to anonymously discuss their feelings of distress and despair, including suicidal thoughts, which may have a positive impact on the individual. They may be expressing feelings that they have never disclosed to anyone in their offline lives. "Rather than concentrating primarily on ways of blocking and censoring such sites, we should think about online opportunities to reach out to people in emotional distress." </body>

      <title>Ed Balls attacks Shoesmith payout</title>
      <description>A six-figure payout to former Haringey children's services head Sharon Shoesmith "leaves a bad taste in the mouth", says shadow chancellor Ed Balls.</description>

      <body>A six-figure payout to the ex-head of Haringey children's services "leaves a bad taste in the mouth," shadow chancellor Ed Balls has said. Sharon Shoesmith, who earned £133,000 a year, won a ruling in 2011 that she was unfairly sacked after a damning report into the death of Baby Peter. BBC Newsnight revealed the payout could cost Haringey Council up to £600,000. In a statement Ms Shoesmith bid a "final farewell" to Haringey, adding she hoped to resume work with children. Peter Connelly, who was 17 months old, died in 2007 after months of abuse. The boy had more than 50 injuries, despite being on the at-risk register and receiving 60 visits from social workers, police and health professionals over eight months. Three people were jailed in 2009, including his mother. The Court of Appeal concluded Ms Shoesmith had been "unfairly scapegoated" and her removal from office in December 2008 by the then Children's Secretary Ed Balls had been "intrinsically unfair and unlawful". One government source told BBC Newsnight that the cost to Haringey Council could be as high as £600,000, although Ms Shoesmith is expected to receive a lower sum. The exact figure may not emerge as there are confidentiality clauses preventing its disclosure but it will be significantly short of the £1m figure it had been reported she was seeking. However, it would appear the package is more than the minimum suggested by senior judge Lord Neuberger in a 2011 ruling in the Court of Appeal. He suggested Ms Shoesmith was entitled to a minimum of three months' salary plus pensions contributions. Three months' salary would have been about £33,000. Mr Balls said his decision in 2008 as children's secretary to remove Sharon Shoesmith from her job had been right. He told the BBC: "An independent report said there were disastrous failings in Haringey children's services. "They said the management was at fault. Sharon Shoesmith was the director of children's services and so of course it leaves a bad taste in the mouth that the person who was leading that department, and responsible, ends up walking away with, it seems, a large amount of money." Earlier, Conservative MP Tim Loughton said the payout became "inevitable" after the Court of Appeal ruled that Mr Balls "had made a complete botched job of her dismissal". But he added: "This is going to leave a really bad taste in taxpayers' mouths that a not insubstantial amount of public money is being used to pay off somebody who presided over a dysfunctional department in Haringey [where] a 17-month-old boy died in horrific circumstances." Care minister Norman Lamb said what happened in the aftermath of the Baby P's death was "extraordinary" but he was not in a position to judge the authority's decisions. "But it is pretty shocking, the scale of the reported payout, given what tragedy unfolded in that particular borough." In her statement, posted on an online networking site, Ms Shoesmith said: "A final farewell to Haringey as my case concludes. I wish those of you in children's services, especially in Haringey, success, strength and courage in all that you do. "Children have been my life's work and I hope to continue in some capacity soon now that my PhD is almost complete." A statement from Haringey Council confirmed it had reached a settlement with Ms Shoesmith but that the terms of the settlement were confidential and it was unable to comment further. Some of the cash will come from central government, but Haringey council will foot most of the bill, it is understood. An exact figure is yet to be agreed. The Department for Education declined to comment on the story when contacted by the BBC. But one source told Newsnight that Education Secretary Michael Gove was "furious" about the secrecy over the amount paid to Ms Shoesmith, believing it to be "indefensible". Downing Street said the Department for Education's contribution to the payout would be made public. Lawyers representing Haringey Council and Ms Shoesmith had been in lengthy discussions regarding a settlement since the May 2011 ruling. Ms Shoesmith had been due to return to court later this week, seeking a declaration that she remained employed by Haringey Council. That action has now been dropped and the settlement reached between the two parties is understood to be a final one. Peter Connelly's mother, Tracey Connelly, her boyfriend, Steven Barker, and his brother, Jason Owen, were jailed in May 2009 for causing or allowing the child's death. Earlier this month it was reported that Connelly was due to be released from prison on parole. </body>

      <title>Call for free vitamins for children</title>
      <description>England's chief medical officer says people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of a "very worrying picture" of children's health and backs a free vitamins scheme.</description>

      <body>England's chief medical officer has said all children should be offered vitamin supplements to safeguard their health. Currently the NHS offers free vitamins A, C and D to all children under five from low-income families. It has been claimed up to 25% of children are vitamin D deficient, leading to a rise in rickets cases. In her annual report, Prof Dame Sally Davies says extending the scheme would protect more children and save money. But she warned people should feel "profoundly ashamed" of what she says is a "very worrying picture" of children's health. And she said the UK lags behind many other European countries. Under the current scheme, children aged six months to four years are eligible for free vitamins if their parents are on benefits. But Dame Sally said more needed to be done to give children a good start with their health, and acting early would save taxpayers' money. She has asked the medicines watchdog, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), to examine the cost-effectiveness of offering vitamins A, C and D to all children under five. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 4's Today programme "Vitamin D deficiency is not just about poverty". She said children with developmental issues due to being born prematurely, those from ethnic minorities as well as children being "covered up" to protect them from the sun thereby missing out on the benefits too, She added: "Children get very locked on to screens and it can be difficult to turf them out into the sunlight. But the sun in the winter doesn't give you as much vitamin D so this is necessary." "This would cost pennies a day and would undoubtedly save money in the long run." She said the giving parents vitamins for their children would "empower" them, giving them an extra boost during the winter months when there is less sunlight. In her report, Dame Sally also called for more research into mental health problems in adolescents. She is calling for a survey of young people's mental health, amid concerns about funding and services. Only 25% of children with clinical mental health disorders receive specialist help within three years. Dame Sally said her annual report - which this year is on child health - questioned whether our society had got the balance right and should act as a wake-up call. She said obesity stood out as one of the big issues, but the report also demonstrated the interplay between health, social environment, emotional environment and education. Some of the statistics, such as five more children aged up to 14 years dying each day of avoidable causes than in Sweden, were "absolutely shocking", she said. Dame Sally told BBC Radio 5 live: "The majority of deaths are in the first year of life, and these relate to prematurity." She said premature births could be reduced by stopping smoking during pregnancy and by improving the health and diet of pregnant women. The chief medical officer's annual report also calls for: National Children's Bureau chief executive Dr Hilary Emery said: "The UK must have greater expectations for children's health if we are to be the best place in the world for children to grow up. "As a nation we must be much more ambitious about giving every child the best start in life, and this should be a priority for all decision makers in central and local government." The report is entitled - Our Children Deserve Better, Prevention Pays. </body>

      <body>Children who are overweight or obese should be encouraged to keep a food-and-activity diary, say new public health guidelines for England. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence says more needs to be done to tackle child obesity. It says getting parents and their children to track what they snack on and how much TV they watch could help. Although rates are levelling off, three in every 10 children aged between two and 15 are overweight or obese. The guidelines make a raft of recommendations, including greater support from local authorities, but say families are at the heart of managing the issue. Children from around the age of 12 - depending on their ability - should be encouraged to monitor their eating, physical activity and any sedentary behaviour, say the guidelines. "For example, encourage them to keep a record of time spent watching television or playing computer games, and what they snack on and when, to identify areas that need addressing," says NICE. For younger children, parents and carers should keep tabs. The guidelines also stress the importance of helping parents and carers recognise that their child is overweight. A National Opinion Poll involving more than 1,000 parents of children aged between four and seven showed that only 14% of those with an obese child considered that their child was overweight. Schools already monitor their pupils by measuring and weighing them at around age five when they start primary school and again as they leave at around the age of 11. NICE says all family members need to be on board, regardless of their own weight, to encourage healthy eating patterns and promote physical exercise - by walking to school, for example. Prof Mike Kelly, Director of the Centre for Public Health at NICE, said: "We are recommending family-based lifestyle programmes are provided which give tailored advice. "These programmes will also support parents to identify changes that can be done at home to tackle obesity - and maintained over the long term. Many of them are things we should all be doing anyway, including healthy eating, getting the whole family to be more active and reducing the amount of time spent watching TV and playing computer games. "Being overweight or obese has a significant impact on a child's quality of life. It can affect their self-esteem and they are more likely to be bullied or stigmatised." </body>

      <description>When does sibling scrapping become bullying?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24639063</url>

      <body>Siblings routinely pick on one another, but when does bickering become bullying - and what can parents do about it? Sibling relationships can be difficult, and never more so than in childhood. But society often regards the scrapping and squabbling, the play fighting and not-so-playful fighting as a normal part of growing up. "The public brushes off aggression between siblings as just rivalry," says Corinna Tucker of the University of New Hampshire. Tucker is the lead author of a new study on the issue for the journal Pediatrics. Almost a third of the 3,600 children questioned said they had been the victim of some sort of sibling aggression in the past 12 months. The included a range of acts from theft and psychological abuse to physical assault, either mild or severe. In comparison, research suggests that up to a quarter of children are victims of schoolyard aggression every year. Corinna Tucker uses the term "sibling aggression" in her study, but psychologists are increasingly reaching for a familiar label for the bad stuff that goes on between brothers and sisters - bullying. This is defined by experts as intentional acts of aggression, repeated over a period of time, where an individual or group is in a position of power over someone. So sibling relationships would seem the perfect breeding ground for bullying, since children live together for a long period of time and there is usually an intellectual and physical power imbalance. Although there might not be an outright malevolence, there is often reason for jealousy. "A sibling relationship is emotionally intense - it's one of those relationships where you can love them and you can hate them at the same time," says Tucker. "And siblings are natural competitors for family resources and parents' attention." Laura - who grew up in a house she shared with four siblings and a foster brother - did not consider it bullying at the time, but now thinks the term captures what went on in their house in Ohio. "My older brother - I would say he beat up on all of us," she says, her voice breaking. Although he never hurt them badly, he liked to wrestle his sisters, pinning them to the floor. "He was bigger and stronger than us - he could put us in very powerless situations. It was really scary." For her brother, she believes, the activity gave him a momentary sense of control at a chaotic time for the family. Her mother, who had depression, had left home. The children were all particularly mean to the youngest sister Tracy who had been the focus of their mother's attention. In the afternoons, after school and before their father came home from work, they would tease Tracy until she phoned her mother to try to get them to stop. "I remember us saying to her: 'Mum can't do anything about it - she isn't coming here,'" recalls Laura. "And my dad - I think he was so overwhelmed that he only ended up dealing with the most serious things." Her father later told Laura that he had sent her foster brother back to the orphanage because he was being bullied so much by Laura's middle sisters, a pair of twins. There is a growing recognition of sibling bullying. One paper published this spring in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence highlighted ways in which it differs from playground or cyber bullying. Twenty-seven pairs of adult siblings were questioned about how they had treated each other during childhood. Most reported they had been bullied, with around a third saying it had gone on for several years. About three-quarters of the sample said they had been both bully and victim. Despite the aggression, victims and perpetrators gave high ratings for closeness, both before and after the incidents they described. Most strikingly of all, a majority viewed it as acceptable and almost all the respondents - 85% - said such behaviour should be expected. "From the young person's perspective and the parent's perspective, we do expect that siblings are going to fight with one another," says Robin Kowalski, the lead author of the study. "But there's normal discord within sibling relationships, and then there's bullying. And I can't tell you where that line is." Corinna Tucker says that some parents believe conflict between siblings can be healthy since it teaches them how to handle difficult situations. But her study, based on the large telephone survey of children, showed that children who reported recent sibling aggression were more likely to be suffering from mental distress. Research led by Dieter Wolke at the University of Warwick on large samples of British and Israeli schoolchildren has found that half the children who suffered from sibling bullying also suffered bullying at school - and that this group was particularly at risk of unhappiness or developing behavioural problems. "If you only have sibling bullying or school bullying you are about 2.7 times more likely to have behaviour problems, but if you have both then it's 14 times more likely," says Wolke. "And the point about this is that you don't have any escape. It's 24/7." Little is known about the long-term effects of sibling bullying but Jan Parker, a family psychotherapist and a co-author of Raising Happy Brothers and Sisters, is certain that they can be "serious and lifelong". "We're very familiar with discussions on the impact of [school] bullying," she says. "I don't think it takes a great imaginative leap to understand the impact of it happening within your own home. You feel that you are not only let down by the person bullying you, but also by the adults in your life that are letting it go unchecked." While sibling fights are normal, parents need to be aware of a pattern developing over time, she says. Parents are advised to talk to the children about what's happening. If they are worried, they could speak to a health professional. They should also consider what might be causing the problems. "There is one known predictor - it's when siblings perceive there to be a wide disparity between how they are treated and how their brother and sister are treated," she says. Play fighting is valuable, since it teaches them what the limits of acceptable behaviour are, says Dieter Wolke. It should be clear to parents when children go too far because they haven't learned the limits - and when they do it on purpose. Parents should be loving but firm, with clear rules, he says. Laura believes that the bullying in her house happened because her parents failed to intervene, because they were too preoccupied with their own issues. "We were so overwhelmed and there was so little adult support to find ways to resolve conflict," she says. She is now 48 and a recovering alcoholic. In adulthood, she established a good relationship with her siblings. She describes the grown-up Tracy as "very strong" and her older brother as a "gentleman". But like some of her siblings she had therapy. Some of her problems, she says, are due to feeling abandoned by her parents. But there are other issues which she relates directly to the sibling bullying - a learned helplessness and a tendency to avoid conflict. This is a problem for her professionally, since her job sometimes requires her to turn down applications for funding, which means having tough conversations. "These are really difficult situations for me," she says. "It sucks to be a middle-aged woman and not know how to do this stuff that you're supposed to learn when you're a teenager." Some names have been changed to protect individuals' identity.

      <body>This is the biggest education provider you've never heard of. Until now. The Alison project - Advanced Learning Interactive Systems Online - has already signed up more than two million students to more than 500 online courses. It's adding another 200,000 each month and founder Mike Feerick is confident this expansion could accelerate even more rapidly and reach a billion students towards the end of the decade. But this ambitious project isn't another Silicon Valley spin-off, fuelled by venture capital and a surfeit of sunshine and flow charts. This global digital empire is based in a technology park in Galway in the west of Ireland. If there was such a thing as successful grey skies thinking, on a damp autumn day, this would be a prime location. But Alison's days in the shade could be numbered, as it has won a prestigious international award this week at the World Innovation Summit for Education in Qatar. The online learning platform has already won an innovation award from Unesco. So how has it stayed below the radar? While the new wave of online courses - so-called Moocs, such as Coursera and edX, have become darlings of the digital media, why has Alison not had the same attention? Mr Feerick says the big difference is who they are trying to reach. It's the academic versus vocational divide being played out in the digital market. "The people we're helping do not have a huge voice," says Mr Feerick. While the Moocs are associated with high-status universities, Alison's focus is on the vast numbers of people around the world needing to improve their vocational skills and training. There are courses in subjects such as computer skills, learning English, basic accountancy, building a website, food safety, immunology, introductions to legal studies. He is planning to expand into secondary school level, with video lessons customised for national exam systems, beginning with maths. Organisations from the IMF to the OECD to the European Union have all spoken of the urgency of providing vocational, workplace skills to tackle dangerously high levels of youth unemployment. But Alison has been putting this into practice. A deal struck earlier this year will provide online training for 12 million young people in the Arab world. Many of those accessing the free courses are at the margins of formal education - low-skilled workers, the unemployed and immigrants. Within the coming months, India is expected to become the biggest source of learners, overtaking the UK and US. Nigeria and the Philippines are rapidly growing markets. Mr Feerick wants to use online technology to offer free lessons in the most important basic skills that people need. As he puts it, 99% of the people are learning the same 1% of information, again and again. His other challenge to the established order, heresy to some, is to question the necessity of exam certificates. If people are studying for a specific skill, such as learning to touch-type or a language, he argues the key question is whether they can put the lessons into practice. He says the fixation with a paper trail of certification is part of protecting an educational status quo. "They desperately want to keep the same system." Alison's other big difference is that it is profitable. The courses are free because of advertising revenue. The social mission is underpinned by a strong business sense. Mr Feerick says his approach to social entrepreneurship was influenced by his own business mentor, Chuck Feeney, a celebrated US investor in ideas and education, who took him under his wing when Mr Feerick had been studying at Harvard. Mr Feeney is a famously frugal and publicity-shy billionaire and philanthropist, who is currently helping to fund New York's hi-tech science campus. Inspired by his example, Mr Feerick says he wanted to combine thinking big commercially while maintaining a sense of social purpose. The idea of free education online, available around the globe, became his focus. "Education underpins all social progress. It's the tool of the most ambitious revolutionary in these technological times, you can change the world if you can change education." He sees the internet as making an irresistible impact on education, in the way it has in other industries, with a few giants emerging to dominate the multi-trillion dollar education market. "There is going to be huge consolidation worldwide into a small number of platforms for learning, because it's going to be very hard to compete with them," he predicts, likening it to how Amazon has become the global bookseller. "So these platforms are going to be huge, some of the biggest and most valuable companies in the world." There are other projects challenging the idea that online learning should be dominated by prestigious Western universities. The Kepler project, launched in September, is using online technology to bring university lessons to Rwanda, to students who otherwise would have no chance of getting into higher education. Using laptops they can take lectures and resources from top universities putting course material online. In the Rwandan campus there are local teachers who are able to provide face-to-face lessons, with a ratio of 30 students for each member of staff. If they successfully complete their course they can get a US accredited degree. There are 50 students in a pilot phase, being charged $1,000 per year. If it works, this will expand rapidly and the longer-term aim is to reach 7,000 to 10,000 students. "There is a rising demand for higher education in Africa that can't be met by traditional models," says Jamie Hodari, chief executive of the non-profit organisation. The economy in Rwanda is growing, but if it wants to compete with other countries it is severely limited by low levels of education. "They have completely hit a wall," says Mr Hodari. Rwanda has ambitions to become a regional technology hub, but it lacks a supply of suitably-qualified graduates. At present, Mr Hodari says "so many children leave as the top of their class and go on to become taxi drivers, because there is no other pathway". The Kepler idea reflects the way that technology is dismantling the component parts of education - separating the local teaching from the online course materials and the international accreditation. If the format works, Mr Hodari says it could be replicated in other parts of Africa and beyond. It could be a "university in a box" that others could copy, he says. "The playbook will be right there in front of them." </body>

      <title>Peek-a-boo: A window on baby's brain</title>
      <description>What a baby's sense of humour can tell us about their brains</description>

      <body>A baby's first smile is an exciting moment. But what can it tell us about their understanding of the world? Boasting about the speed of childhood development is the sport of choice for many a doting parent. From the 12-week scan right through the early years, monitoring the physical and mental progress of their pride and joy is a source of both excitement and concern. Especially rewarding is the onset of smiles, squeals and laughter - the kind of milestones that make all the disturbed nights worth it. But is it all just wind? Apparently not, as researchers now think that laughter and games like peek-a-boo could be telling us something more, and giving us a way to peer inside the workings of their minds. "Laughter and smiles start incredibly early, just like tears," says Dr Caspar Addyman, a baby laughter researcher at Birkbeck College in London. "So this leads us to think that it's a form of communication," he told the BBC. Dr Addyman has collected nearly 700 questionnaires about baby smiles and laughter from around the world. He found that babies are smiling in response to pleasant feelings much earlier than expected, which can be as young as one month old. Soon after that, at between two to four months, social smiles develop that are used specifically to engage the parents. He now hopes to take the research further and use laughter as a new way of tracking what it is that babies understand about the world around them. The person who most greatly influenced our current view of childhood development was Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget. Careful observations of children at different ages led him to identify four stages that everyone must go through to reach the cognitive abilities of an adult (see box). In the earliest months of life, Piaget said that babies are only able to learn about the world by directly interacting with it through grasping, shaking and sucking. With each experience, he concluded, children gradually build up a picture of how the world works - a kind of naïve physics. But Dr Addyman thinks that studying babies' laughter can be just as effective at helping us pinpoint developments in the way their minds are expanding. "You can't laugh at something until you get the joke, so what they laugh at really tells us about their understanding of the world," says Addyman. As a result of having experienced so little, small children are for the most part quite content to accept the absurd as completely plausible. Dr Addyman, who sports a crop of bright blue hair, sees this regularly with his young volunteers. "Young babies would never laugh at my hair. But older children realise there's something wrong and that makes it funny." The ability of children to suddenly see the funny side, Dr Addyman believes, acts to highlight much more profound developments going on deep inside their brains. The Baby Laughter Project, which has surveyed parents from more than 20 countries, has shown that games like peek-a-boo are perfect for showing one such fundamental development - object permanence. The term describes the understanding that an object still exists, even if you can't see it. Very young children don't know this, which is why babies under around six months can look shocked and startled at peek-a-boo. They think that not being able to see mum or dad's face means that they've actually disappeared, making their sudden reappearance come as quite a surprise. However once a child understands (at around six- to eight-months old) that their parent is just hiding, then peek-a-boo becomes all about the anticipation of when they're going to come back. "Peek a boo is all the best things. It's mummy reappearing, but it's also about shared communication," says Dr Addyman. "You can't help but smile and laugh when a baby starts laughing with you, which is really valuable for them developing their ability to interact with other people." A potential link between laughter and language development suggests we've thus far underestimated babies' sense of humour. Joking requires an element of taking turns as well as other skills needed for advanced interaction, like imitation and eye-contact. "Children can pick up the rhythms of conversation through joking and playing games," says Dr Addyman. In fact, smiles and laughter could be important communication tools for infants before they develop language. Even primates seem to use laughter as a way of regulating social interaction. "Laughter in chimps is predominantly used in play and it tends to be the youngest members of the group who have time for playing," says Dr Katie Slocombe, a primate cognition specialist at the University of York. "It's been shown in chimps that laughter facilitates extended play, and we can't rule out that it has some sort of role in social bonding. When a chimp laughs, it seems to encourage their play partner to continue tickling or chasing them - just like a baby keeping an adult's attention for longer," she told the BBC. So should we try harder to interpret the deeper meaning in those burbles and titters? Dr Addyman suggests a certain level of caution. "Historically, we've certainly been guilty of projecting adult interpretations about what babies are laughing at, and it's a constant danger when doing this kind of research," he says. "You really have to look at this scientifically and at a range of ages to really start to understand what's going on in their heads." </body>

      <title>Warning children about online porn</title>
      <description>Can schools keep pupils safe and innocent?</description>

      <body>Concerns about children's exposure to graphic sexual images online have led to calls for primary pupils to hear about the dangers of pornography. So how should schools broach the subject and what is the right age to start? At Castledyke Primary in Barton, North Lincolnshire, head teacher Rosie Pugh has adopted a robust approach to building children's resilience to any explicit material they may see online and is in no doubt that it needs to start early. She fears there are children vulnerable to abuse among her pupils and describes some of the stories she has heard from families as "eye-popping". Her views echo fears voiced by Ofsted earlier this year in a report which found that a lack of quality age appropriate sex and relationships education in more than a third of schools risks leaving children vulnerable to inappropriate sexual behaviours and sexual exploitation. The BBC sat in on a session for seven- to nine-year-olds at Castledyke run by Lynnette Smith, who teaches sex education and trains teachers in the subject in North Lincolnshire and East Yorkshire. Her approach is cheerful, direct and accompanied by hand-drawn illustrations that look as if they might have been done by an off-duty artist from The Beano. Each picture presents a scenario to which the children are asked to give a thumbs up or thumbs down. Lynnette uses the same set of cards for presentations from four-year-olds in their first year of the infants, to 10 and 11-year-olds about to leave for secondary school. The children find it hilarious. There are gales of laughter, coupled with appalled cries of disgust, but the half-hour sessions, which involve the whole class of up to 30 children, their teacher and a learning assistant, tackle some serious issues. Classes like this may not be suitable for all primaries cautions Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT): "Innocence is precious. You don't want to start too young." "My bottom line is to ask, 'From what age are they vulnerable?'" says Ms Smith. "Our first card is a girl with no clothes on. She looks as if she is ready for the bath. Well I hope she is not going to school". Lynnette asks the children to list the body parts that they should not let people touch. "Your widger and your lucy," is the response. She encourages the class to use "scientific" names instead of colloquialisms. The class chorus words like genitals, penis and vagina. There is a point to this. Knowledge and understanding can help keep a child safe, says Lynnette. "Paedophiles will avoid an educated child." The cards tackle different forms of good and bad touching. A kiss with a smile, a boy giving another boy a flower. A thumbs up to all of this. Then, grabbing a woman's breasts, looking under toilet doors when someone is inside, pulling at a boy's underwear. Thumbs down to this, declare the class. The cards tackle subtleties like where it is OK to urinate, expose your genitals or underwear or indeed to "have a little rummage in your underwear" - not outside, in broad daylight, but somewhere private like the bathroom. What sort of photographs are OK? Smiling at the camera with all your clothes on gets a thumbs up. Showing your bottom to the camera, a thumbs down. "He could put it on the internet!" says a boy. "It's a private part of the body. Nobody should ever take pictures of the private parts of your body except perhaps if you get injured and have to go to hospital," explains Lynnette. The next card depicts an older boy apparently showing a younger child an unsuitable image he has downloaded on to a smartphone. "Wrong, wrong, wrong", yells one boy. "No-one should make you watch something like that. You must tell someone," says Lynnette. Each child is asked to think of someone at home and someone at school they would tell. The picture after that is the view from behind a sofa where two adults are watching a porn film. "There are films where the actors have no clothes on or are hurting each other that some grown-ups want to look at but it's not meant for children," says Lynette. "If this is grown-ups watching and you are not there then that's fine but not if it's your babysitter or older children." There are hints that some members of the class are already aware of this sort of film: "My brother looks at pictures like this. He's 20," one child says. When Lynette asks if the child is forced to look at the pictures, he says no. Lynnette says the attitude of most children and young people is the same as it ever was. "Most are the same naive little kids who just want to know more about their bodies and are totally appalled and repelled by the idea of sex. "There are still a lot like that even at 14. "But because I have been in sex education since the mid-90s, I have seen how it's progressing. In 2002 everyone got the internet and much younger children began to see pornography. "Ten- and 11-year-olds are often keen to tell you what they have seen." Sometimes, she says, this kind of exposure can lead to sexually inappropriate behaviour and make children vulnerable to sexual exploitation. At the very least, children are asking questions about sexual issues at a much earlier age, particularly if they have seen something online or in the media that they do not understand. Sex and relationship education, she argues, is in urgent need of updating as the current guidelines do not mention issues such as sexting (the sending of sexually explicit material via a mobile phone) or pornography. In her presentation to parents before the sessions with children, she explains how vital it is to talk to children about these issues in the early years of primary school. Ideally the parents should feel confident to answer their child's questions. "If you're not sure of an answer, research it, maybe together in a book," she advises. "Don't ever say, 'Ask me when you're older,' because that's like saying, 'Go and Google it.' "If they know that they can talk to you now they will keeping coming back to you for information into their teenage years. "Most parents get it about right until children are about five and then they get the jitters." Some of the mothers said they had been horrified when they first read the school's letter about Lynette's visit but were reassured by her explanations. "I thought, no they're only seven. My husband said thank heavens he was away," said one. "It was never like this when I was at school. You find sex on television even at seven in the evening. I don't know how to address it really but you have to talk about it," said another. Ofsted's report said some schools left children vulnerable to abuse because they did not teach them appropriate language or develop the confidence to describe unwanted behaviours. It also said sex education in some primary pupils left pupils "ill-prepared" for puberty. The NAHT has called for "conversations" about online dangers to start early in primary school but Mr Hobby says these should be "general warnings that they may see things they don't like online and advice on what to do about it when they do". With schools needing to walk a line between protecting children from harm and maintaining their innocence, Mr Hobby says: "It needs a decision for each primary school in full consultation with parents." For Castledyke's head teacher, encouraging parents and teachers to talk about the issue with children is key to helping protect youngsters in vulnerable families from becoming victims of abuse. "I am always really surprised about how coy some adults are, but once it's in the open it's quite simple. You just need to speak to children openly, honestly and confidently", says Ms Pugh. "We've got to stop it happening to another generation." </body>

      <title>Why did it go wrong at Al-Madinah?</title>
      <description>What does the Al-Madinah case say about free schools?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-24569961</url>
      <date>1382028225</date>

      <body>Described as "dysfunctional" and "in chaos", there can be no doubt that the problems at the Al-Madinah School go right to its core. Rated inadequate in all four inspection areas, Ofsted said problems at the Derby school were "myriad". Not only does it lack the basic structures needed to operate, it is said to be close to "collapsing". Al-Madinah is the second free school to be put into special measures, after Discovery Free School in May 2013. A further five out of the 24 inspected so far have been labelled "requiring improvement" - the next worse category. But then it is only two years into the programme. Across England the latest Ofsted figures show that 2% of state schools are in special measures - 383 out of 21,186 inspections. But no up-and-running free school has unravelled quite so publicly as this Derby-based Muslim faith school. It started with claims about female staff being required to wear hijabs, Islamic headscarves, but the focus has shifted to the "unacceptable" level of education the government and inspectors now say it is providing. The key thing that makes this Ofsted report stand out, is the fact that the findings come just a year after the school opened. Most schools that deteriorate tend to do so over a much longer period of time. And many of the problems it highlights seem to have implications for the particular nature of free schools and the extra freedoms they are allowed. The report's second line says: "This is a school which has been set up and run by representatives of the community with limited knowledge and experience." Education Secretary Michal Gove argued that taking schools out of the hands of bureaucrats would liberate innovators to push up standards through reform and experimentation. But the Ofsted findings in this case reflect exactly what detractors of such DIY school projects feared would happen. They asked how people who knew little about education could set up and run something so complex and important as a school. In addition, teaching, which the government sees as the most important engine raising attainment, was found to be "inadequate". "Many teachers are inexperienced and have not received the training and support they need," the Ofsted report said. This seems to highlight one of the most fundamental differences between free schools and regular state schools - there is no obligation to employ qualified teachers in England's free schools. The Department for Education argued that it gave free schools this freedom, which exists amongst independent schools, to enable them to employ industry experts. But this does not appear to have worked in the pupils' favour in the Al-Madinah case. The Ofsted report said: "Almost all teaching seen during the inspection, including in the Early Years Foundation Stage, was judged inadequate." It added that most teaching and lessons in the primary school were poorly planned and that teachers did not know how to use pupils' assessments to plan lessons and set work. Questions are now being asked about how the Department for Education could approve a school for opening one year, only for it to be found to lack the "basic systems" it needs to operate 12 months later. Were the checks necessary for ensuring the school would be fit for purpose undertaken in a sufficiently rigorous way? Judging from the pre-registration report undertaken by Ofsted in the July before it opened, no assessment was made by the inspectorate of the school's ability to educate pupils. But Ofsted did wave the red flag at this stage over child protection measures, saying that four regulations had not yet been met and that staff needed to undertake training on such issues. This was highlighted by shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt in an emergency question in the Commons. The DfE has insisted that it took all necessary steps to ensure the school was fit for purpose when it opened in September 2012. It said: "Ofsted recommended Al-Madinah should be registered as long as four requirements were met. "Ofsted often sets out a number of requirements it wants to see before new schools can open. In this case, [Al-Madinah Education Trust] provided the necessary evidence to show that these requirements were met." But the report also said the school had "not been adequately monitored or supported". Prime Minister David Cameron has taken to local radio to say that the school should close if it does not take immediate action to put things right. But he also said that this particular case should not be used as a "stick to beat the whole free school movement" as these were delivering a better standard of education than most state schools. He quoted figures hailed by the DfE earlier in the year which said three-quarters of the first free schools were rated good or outstanding - which a spokesman pointed out was a significantly higher proportion than all state schools. But a check of the latest Ofsted data reveals that a higher proportion of state schools (78%) are rated good or outstanding compared with 75% of free schools. But Mr Hunt said the education of children in Derby was being sacrificed for ideology. He added: "It's not just the Al-Madinah School which is dysfunctional, it's the education secretary's free school policy." </body>

      <title>Digging deep on social mobility</title>
      <description>Stagnating social mobility warning - are the young paying the price?</description>

      <body>Alan Milburn says he was asked by the coalition to "hold its feet to the fire" in examining its progress on social mobility and child poverty. But just how much will his words hurt? In this, the first of what is planned to be an annual "State of the Nation report", the commission led by the former Labour health secretary concludes that "Britain remains a deeply divided country", one where "being born poor often leads to a lifetime of poverty". The commission says austerity has made it even harder to break ingrained cycles of poverty, that "disadvantage and advantage cascade down the generations". It warns there is a danger that social mobility will go in to reverse after rising in the middle of the last century and "flatlining" towards the end of it. The post-war years saw a big expansion of the middle classes, as the professional jobs market grew and more people bought their own homes, but there has been little change in the last quarter of the century. Mr Milburn said over decades, the UK had become a wealthier society, but had "struggled to become a fairer one" and had more children living in poverty and lower levels of social mobility than "many other developed nations". A total of 2.3 million children (one in six) live in poverty, he said, and this made it essential that the pattern where "birth not worth" determined a person's chances in life was changed. Higher social mobility had become "the new holy grail of public policy". It is certainly something all parties now say they want to see. The report from the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission has stinging words on some areas of government policy but they are sweetened with praise for others, including the fact that the coalition continues to "stick to its commitments" on ending child poverty and improving social mobility in "challenging times". Mr Milburn told journalists at a news conference the government "deserved credit" for that. But the target of ending child poverty by 2020 - begun under Labour and continued by the coalition government - would "in all likelihood" be missed, he said. His most stinging criticism seemed to be about the way the young were likely to pay the highest price for a lack of social mobility and poverty during the global financial crisis. He called for older generations to be asked to dig deeper. The number of young people who have been unemployed for two years or more is at a "20-year high", he said. And there was an "inter-generational unfairness" in terms of who was being asked to pick up the bill in the recession. He did not call for pension cuts, but Mr Milburn said politicians should be prepared to "break political taboos" to talk about whether wealthier pensioners should lose benefits currently available to all - particularly the winter fuel allowance and the free TV licence. Pensioners were usually more worried about their grandchildren than themselves, he said. The commission is also looking to employers to do more - to offer better training, pay higher wages and open up professions to a wider pool of people. Two-thirds of children living in poverty, the report says, are living in homes with a working parent. Schools and universities were also urged to do more. He said schools in some areas were letting down pupils from poorer homes and those from middle-income homes too. Schools should give more help to low-achievers from middle-income homes as well as the poorest, while the government should improve careers advice, give extra incentives for teachers to teach in the worst schools and pay colleges "by results they achieve for their students in the labour market - not the numbers they recruit". As for universities - which were the focus of an earlier report by the commission - he says the sector as a whole has drawn in more students from poorer homes but top institutions remain out of reach for too many. Each year, he said, there were 3,700 "missing" state school pupils who had achieved the grades needed to get in to universities in the Russell Group (which represents some of the UK's leading universities) but did not go to them. The commission called for the government to put social mobility at the heart of its policies and practices, so that it was a "golden thread" running through all it did. It concentrated on the overall UK picture, but pointed out that in Scotland and Wales, the issue "currently has a low profile". In an age of austerity, the report's authors suggest creating a fairer society will be a job for all - and far from pain-free. </body>

      <body>A school in Bath is reported to have banned pupils from handing out birthday party invitations at school unless the entire class is on the guest list. Father-of-three Ben Milne explores the social minefield of children's parties. It's one of the big questions for parents of small children. Do you invite the whole class to little Harry or Sophie's party, or do you face the fall-out? What the head teacher of Kingswood Prep School in Bath has proposed isn't that revolutionary. At my children's primary school, for instance, the policy is for the child to give their teacher the invitations, which will then be placed discreetly in the invitees' school bags or trays. Nobody feels snubbed, and everybody's happy. What could possibly go wrong with this plan? Oh yes. Children. There you are, waiting for the hordes to arrive, furniture all re-arranged, and party food out on the table. Then your little darling realises they've got a school bag full of invites they've forgotten to give to the teacher. This actually happened to my nephew on his 10th birthday. He was remarkably sanguine about this (the unexpected windfall of unlimited Wotsits seemed to soften the blow somewhat). And if you do invite the whole class, what then? Do you really want your living room used to re-enact Battle Royale with party bags? Or if you want to keep the repair bill down, do you throw large sums of money at the local multiplex or five-a-side pitch? So it's time to whittle down the list. There's the Katie Hopkins method (exclude any child who doesn't share a name with a minor royal) or else there's a process of intense negotiation down from the 200 closest friends your child announces they want to invite, down to the manageable four you had in mind. But is it so bad not being invited to parties? Like a lot of not-very-nice, but survivable things in childhood - not being picked for the team, being blamed for something you didn't do - a snub isn't nice, but it's a small but valuable lesson for the hardships life one day throws at you. As Nietzsche (or was it Kelly Clarkson?) said, "What doesn't kill us, makes us stronger." I don't think he had kids' parties in mind, though.

      <description>Netflix tests "ultra high definition" video streaming as it looks to launch a full service to users in 2014.</description>

      <body>Netflix, the TV and film streaming service, has started testing "ultra high definition" video. Also known as 4K the technology offers four times the amount of detail as 1080p high-definition content. Netflix said it plans to offer the first titles in 4K to customers next year. But some analysts question whether broadband speeds in the UK are fast enough to cope with ultra high definition streaming. "Average broadband speeds in the UK are 7.6 megabits per second, you would need to have at least double that speed to watch 4K reliably on a streamed basis," says IHS broadband analyst, Richard Broughton. "Currently only 15% to 20% of households have the speeds necessary." Despite wide availability of broadband networks in the UK's towns and cities, only 4.8 million customers are taking advantage of "superfast" speeds, defined by Ofcom watchdog as 30Mbps or above. Craig Nelson, spokesman for the Internet Service Providers' Association, told the BBC: "We think streaming of 4K TV services will require minimum broadband speeds of about 100Mbps to work properly, but only businesses and production houses current have that kind of speed. "A lot will depend on the compression technologies, or codecs, service providers use. "The real hindrance won't be broadband speeds but the availability of screens." Only a few manufacturers currently make 4K TVs and, as with all cutting-edge technologies, they are expensive. For example, Panasonic's 65in LED 4K TV costs £5,500, while Sony's equivalent costs £5,000. </body>

      <body>A robot developed by Japanese scientists is so fast it can "win" the rock-paper-scissors game against a human every single time. The Janken robot - named after the game's Japanese name - is a faster version of one unveiled by University of Tokyo researchers in June 2012. Version two completes its chosen hand shape almost at the same time as the human hand. It uses high-speed recognition and reaction, rather than prediction. Technically, the robot cheats because it reacts extremely quickly to what the human hand is doing rather than making a premeditated simultaneous action as the rules state. Taking just one millisecond (ms) - a thousandth of a second - to recognise what shape the human hand is making, it then chooses a winning move and reacts at high speed. Version one completed its shape 20ms after the human hand; version two finishes almost simultaneously. The scientists at the Ishikawa Oku Laboratory, part of the University of Tokyo, specialise in a range of technologies, including "sensor fusion", which aims to replicate and improve upon the human senses using high-speed intelligent robots. But Sethu Vijayakumar, professor of robotics at Edinburgh University, told the BBC: "These robots are really fast at reaction, but there are scenarios where even a millisecond's delay is not acceptable, such as accident avoidance or virtual stock markets. "In these cases we need to combine high-speed reaction with high-speed prediction, using game theory and behaviour patterning." </body>

      <title>US to build hypersonic spy plane</title>
      <description>The US has revealed plans to develop a robot spy plane that is designed to fly at six times the speed of sound.</description>

      <body>Lockheed Martin has begun work on a successor to the supersonic Blackbird SR-71 spy plane. The unmanned SR-72 will use an engine that combines a turbine and a ramjet to reach its top speed of Mach 6 - about 3,600mph (5,800km/h). Like its predecessor, the SR-72 will be designed for high-altitude surveillance but might also be fitted with weapons to strike targets. Lockheed said the aircraft should be operational by 2030. The SR-72 is being developed at Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works RandD centre in California that designed and built the original Blackbird. That aircraft first flew in 1964 and was a mainstay of US Air Force spying and surveillance work until 1998. It typically flew at altitudes of 24,000m (80,000ft) and could reach speeds of Mach 3. In a blogpost about the SR-72, Lockheed Martin said the aircraft would operate at similar altitudes but would fly far faster. At Mach 6 the plane could travel the 3,500 miles (5,500km) from New York to London in less than an hour. While spy satellites can photograph enemy territory, the relatively long time it takes for them to be moved to a new orbit so they pass over a target can limit their usefulness. By contrast, wrote Lockheed Martin, the SR-72 "would be so fast, an adversary would have no time to react or hide". For the SR-72, Lockheed Martin is drawing on work done on the Falcon HTV-2 hypersonic technology vehicle. This is a test-bed for the futuristic technologies needed to support safe hypersonic flight and cope with the extreme conditions encountered by any object flying at such a speed. For instance, on one test flight of the HTV-2, the aircraft hit a top speed of Mach 20 and its flight surfaces reached 1,927C (3,500F). To reach Mach 6, the SR-72 will use an engine that acts like a normal jet turbine until speeds of Mach 3 are reached but which then operates like a ramjet to accelerate beyond that. "Speed is the next aviation advancement to counter emerging threats in the next several decades," said Brad Leland, Lockheed Martin's hypersonic programme manager on the blog. "The technology would be a game-changer in theatre, similar to how stealth is changing the battlespace today." </body>

      <body>Shares in struggling smartphone maker Blackberry have fallen 13% after it announced it had abandoned a plan to sell itself to its biggest shareholder, Fairfax Financial Holdings. Instead, it intends to raise $1bn (£627m) in fresh financing. Chief executive Thorsten Heins will step down and former Sybase chief executive John Chen will serve as interim chief executive. Last month, Blackberry reported a second-quarter net loss of $965m. Those losses were blamed on poor sales of its new smartphone, the Z10. Fairfax was planning to lead a consortium of firms in a takeover of Blackberry worth $4.7bn. But that plan, announced last month, has fallen through. Last week, Reuters reported that Fairfax was struggling to raise the financing needed for the deal. Instead, Fairfax, which owns a 10% stake in Blackberry, is contributing $250m to the new fund-raising. "This financing provides an immediate cash injection on terms favourable to Blackberry, enhancing our substantial cash position," said Barbara Stymiest, chair of Blackberry's board of directors. In September, the company announced a plan to cut 4,500 jobs, or 40% of its workforce, to reverse giant losses. The interim chief executive, John Chen, acknowledged the challenge ahead: "Blackberry is an iconic brand with enormous potential - but it's going to take time, discipline and tough decisions to reclaim our success." Some analysts remain sceptical about the firm's prospects. "Now we're back to the downward spiral," said BGC Partners analyst Colin Gillis. "They've got $1bn more cash that buys them time. The drumbeat of negativity is likely to continue." </body>

      <body>A hacking group calling itself Anonymous Indonesia claims to have attacked over 170 Australian sites, following reports of Australian spying. The sites affected seemed to belong primarily to small businesses. On Friday, Indonesia summoned Australia's ambassador amid reports that its Jakarta embassy was used as part of a US-led spying network. The reports were based on a US National Security Agency document leaked by whistleblower Edward Snowden. The allegations caused anger in Indonesia, which is a key ally and trading partner of Australia. The Australian government has declined to comment on the reports, saying it does not comment on intelligence matters. Indonesian Foreign Minister Marty Natalegawa told reporters on Monday: "Enough is enough". "While [the US and Australia] are not able to confirm or deny past activities, at least they should be able, and I'm making a public expectation here, I think they should be able to say henceforth they are not going to do it anymore," he said. "In the absence of assurances that such [spying] activities never took place, then of course we must assume that such activities are taking place, and draw our own conclusion in terms of their view of Indonesia as a partner," he added. Anonymous Indonesia posted a list on Twitter of more than 100 Australian websites it said it had hacked. Sites affected including a bouncy castle company and a dry cleaner. Affected websites were replaced with the message: "Stop spying on Indonesia", and an image of a Guy Fawkes silhouette on the Indonesia and Australian flags. Members of the online group wear Guy Fawkes masks when demonstrating in public or in online videos. The spying allegations were originally published by German newspaper Der Spiegel. The newspaper described a signals intelligence programme called Stateroom which intercepted radio, telecommunications and internet traffic using equipment in US, British, Australian and Canadian diplomatic missions. Diplomatic posts involved included those in Jakarta, Bangkok, Hanoi, Beijing and Kuala Lumpur, amongst others, the Sydney Morning Herald reported late last week. The reports are the latest in a series of documents leaked by ex-US intelligence contractor Edward Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia and is wanted in the US in connection with the unauthorised disclosures. The US is facing growing anger over reports it spied on its allies abroad. However, correspondents say that in reality most governments conduct surveillance or espionage operations against other countries whose activities matter to them. </body>

      <body>Imax, the cinema technology company specialising in immersive 3D screenings, is to offer home cinemas for China's wealthy elite in a joint venture with Shenzhen's TCL Multimedia. Each luxury theatre will cost at least $250,000 (£157,000), Reuters reported. "China now is our second largest market in the world, and our fastest growing market," Imax chief executive Richard Gelfond said. The company is also targeting Russia, Hong Kong and the Middle East. China's burgeoning wealthy class is hungry for luxury goods of all kinds, with TCL estimating that the home theatre market will grow 20% a year over the next five years. Three-D films are also growing in popularity, with more than 80% of audiences for the recent blockbuster film Gravity opting for the 3D format thanks to the film's ground-breaking special effects. Luxury, immersive home cinemas are now possible - albeit only for the rich - thanks to advancements in 3D and large-screen technology. Shooting a film with dedicated Imax cameras used to cost more than £6m before the company developed a way of converting standard films to Imax format using algorithms for less than £1m. Producers started making films specifically for 3D, with James Cameron's Avatar in 2009 proving to be the first mainstream 3D box office success, taking about $250m in Imax theatres. Imax already earns 16% of its revenue in China, and now has 131 screens installed there. In July, it announced an agreement with China's Dalian Wanda Group Corp to build up to 120 new cinemas in the country, building on its 2011 deal with the group. </body>

      <description>Zynga's Scramble With Friends game does not infringe Mattel's Scrabble trademarks, a High Court judge rules.</description>

      <body>Zynga's Scramble With Friends word game for mobile devices does not infringe Mattel's Scrabble trademarks, a High Court judge has ruled. Mattel had argued that Zynga's use of the word "Scramble" was too close to the word "Scrabble". But Mr Justice Peter Smith disagreed. However, he did accept that Zynga's use of a curly letter M in the logo "gives the impression that the word is Scrabble when one looks at it quickly and has the propensity to confuse". This means Zynga will have to change the game's logo, but not the name itself. US company Mattel, the world's biggest toy manufacturer, owns brands such as Barbie, Hot Wheels and Fisher-Price Toys, as well as Scrabble. In response to the ruling, Mattel spokesman Alan Hilowitz said: "We are pleased that the English High Court today affirmed Mattel's request for an injunction against Zynga, finding that the similarities between their Scramble With Friends logo and Mattel's intellectual property likely would confuse the public into thinking they were in fact downloading Scrabble. "We are, however, disappointed that the court did not rule that Zynga should cease using the Scramble name, which Mattel intends to appeal." Zynga said it was not prepared to comment on the case. The ruling will be a relief to Zynga, the online games company that made its stock market debut in December 2011 and was valued at $1bn (£630m). Since then it has struggled to replicate the success of games such as FarmVille and Words With Friends. In October, the company reported a net loss of $68,000 for its third quarter, compared with a $57.3m loss for the same period last year. While the results were better than expected, year-on-year revenues fell 36% to $202.5m and the number of fee-paying players has halved to about 1.6 million. But chief executive Don Mattrick, who joined Zynga in July from his role as head of interactive entertainment at Microsoft, maintained that a return to profitability was in sight for the company. Zynga bought OMGPOP, the company behind the popular game Draw Something, for $200m in March 2012, but shut the company less than a year later. Despite the setbacks, Zynga's share price has risen 60% over the past 52 weeks. </body>

      <body>A new £18m roller coaster at Alton Towers has closed after wheels fell off and hit four people in the front carriage. A spokeswoman said some "small guide wheels" came off The Smiler as it was being pulled up an incline. Kevin Hayes-Heath, who was in the carriage with his partner Wayne, said the incident was "pretty frightening". Debris hit him on the shoulder and his partner in the face. A teenage girl and her father were also hit, he said. "You are at the highest point of the ride and you've got all these loops to do and you just think that the carriage is going to come off," Mr Hayes-Heath said. "We were shouting at them to stop the ride because they were about to send another party off." Alton Towers said the ride completed its circuit and no evacuation was required. A spokeswoman confirmed that plastic guide wheels were flicked onto a teenager and three adults in the front row of the train. The rest of the guide wheels were caught by safety netting, she added. The injured people were looked after by park staff and did not need treatment by the ambulance service, the spokeswoman said. The park said an investigation would be carried out into Saturday's incident to decide when the ride could re-open. The 14-loop Smiler was shut for four days on 21 July after a piece fell off the track, and 48 people had to be rescued. It closed again in August for five days due to a "technical issue". The ride, which opened in May, includes a drop of 30m (98ft). The spokeswoman said: "We have very stringent safety procedures on all of our rides including CCTV so the ride was stopped immediately by the rides team. "All of our rides and attractions are expected to meet extremely high standards, technologically, mechanically and in terms of the end experience, and a full investigation is on going before we determine whether to re-open the ride. "We are sorry for any disappointment the ride's temporary closure caused our visitors but the health and safety of all of our visitors is our absolute priority." </body>

      <body>The first ever YouTube awards have been held in New York, with actor Jason Schwartzman and musician Reggie Watts presiding over a frenetic ceremony. As YouTube is a video-sharing site, the event featured Eminem, Lady Gaga and M.I.A making live music videos directed by the awards' creator, Spike Jonze, and others. Eminem won Artist of the Year, while Taylor Swift's I Knew You Were Trouble took the YouTube Phenomenon award. The ceremony was streamed live online. Nominees were chosen by taking into account the YouTube views, likes, comments and subscription figures for different artists. Indie actress Greta Gerwig kicked off proceedings at the sprawling Pier 36 venue, performing in a live video for Arcade Fire and their new song Afterlife. Lady Gaga was up next, tears rolling down her cheeks as she performed her single Dope for the first time wearing a baseball cap and flannel shirt. The coveted Video of the Year award went to South Korean group Girls' Generation for their song I Got A Boy, while Innovation of the Year went to DeStorm Power, the YouTube user whose 250 videos on the website have been watched more than 200 million times. The inaugural YouTube awards reflect an increasing trend for people to turn to the internet, rather than television and radio, for music and video. In August last year, the Nielsen rating agency published a survey in which 64% of American adolescents said they listened to music on YouTube, compared with 56% who listened to radio. </body>

      <body>EBay has apologised and removed from sale about 30 items of memorabilia from the Nazi Holocaust, following an investigation by a UK newspaper. The Mail on Sunday said it had found "dozens" of items related to the Holocaust on the site last week. Among them was a uniform said to belong to a Polish baker who died at Auschwitz for $18,000 (£11,200), it said. The online auction site apologised and said it had made a donation of $40,000 (£25,000) to charity. The Mail on Sunday said other items listed included shoes and a toothbrush said to have belonged to concentration camp victims and Star of David armbands used to mark out Jews for persecution. It said it had alerted eBay and the online auctioneer had removed 30 items from sale. The newspaper said eBay had been unable to say how long such items may have been for sale on its website. EBay said: "We are very sorry these items have been listed on eBay and we are removing them. "We don't allow listings of this nature, and dedicate thousands of staff to policing our site and use the latest technology to detect items that shouldn't be for sale. "We very much regret that we didn't live up to our own standards. We have made a donation to charity to reflect our concern." Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators during the World War Two Holocaust. The Nazis also murdered and imprisoned millions of others, including Romany Gypsies, homosexual people, and disabled people. </body>

      <title>Patent wars: Rockstar sues Samsung</title>

      <body>A group of tech giants known as the Rockstar Consortium is suing Google, Samsung, HTC and others over alleged mobile phone patent infringements. Rockstar, jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, Blackberry, Ericsson and Sony, is targeting manufacturers of phones that run the rival Google Android operating system. Rockstar spent $4.5bn (£2.8bn) buying thousands of Nortel patents after the telecoms giant went bankrupt in 2009. Google lost out in the bidding war. The Rockstar lawsuit claims Google has infringed seven patents relating to the way internet search terms match up with relevant advertising. The move is just the latest in a number of mobile device patent cases being fought across the world, as technology behemoths fight for dominance of the lucrative smartphone, tablet and games console markets. Google's Android has been doing particularly well, largely thanks to the success of Samsung's Galaxy range of smartphones. Android devices accounted for 81.3% of smartphone shipments in the third quarter of 2013, according to research firm Strategy Analytics, compared with 13.4% for Apple iOS and 4.1% for Windows Phone. This week, Nokia, whose mobile devices division is being bought by Microsoft, won a patent victory over HTC that could see the Taiwanese company's HTC One smartphone being banned from import into the UK. And earlier in October, Samsung offered to stop taking rivals to court over alleged patent infringements for a period of five years, after European Union authorities said the South Korean company's litigious actions were stifling competition. Samsung faced a potential £11.3bn ($18.3bn) fine if found guilty of breaching European anti-trust laws. Google's Motorola Mobility, which the search giant bought for $12.5bn, has also been accused of similar anti-competitive behaviour. Samsung and Apple are currently slugging it out in the courts of more than 10 countries across Europe. But some senior technology experts believes the legal conflict is bad for consumers. In an interview with the BBC's Click programme to be broadcast on Saturday, Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak says: "There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone; I wish Apple would use them, and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology; all our products would be better, we'd go further. "I do kind of wish they were more compatible." But the Rockstar Consortium's legal action suggests such a rapprochement in the global patent wars is still a long way off. </body>

      <body>Google has officially unveiled the latest incarnation of its flagship Nexus smartphone. Made by LG, the handset is smaller, slimmer and lighter than the Nexus 4 but its 4.96in (126mm) touchscreen is bigger. The Nexus 5 has been developed to show off the capabilities of the new version of the Android operating system. Called Kitkat, the software has been designed to work well on both high-end smartphones and cheaper feature phones. The alliance with Google has helped bolster LG's fortunes even though, according to statistics from Gartner, it is still a long way behind rivals Samsung and Apple. In the April-to-June quarter, the consultancy indicated 3.8% of all smartphones sold were LG handsets putting the South Korean firm in third place. By contrast, Apple accounted for 18.8% of all sales and Samsung 29.7%. The specifications for the new phone were widely leaked before it was announced on the official Google blog. The gadget shares some of the hardware from LG's G2 handset and can record and play back HD video at the full 1080p resolution. Its camera also has a rapid burst system that captures several photographs at the same time so owners can pick the best shot. The handset is due to go on sale on 1 November in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Japan and Korea. "Nexus devices serve an important function for Google," said Ben Wood, head of research at analyst firm CCS Insight. "The company collaborates closely with the chosen phone maker as it rolls out a new version of the Android operating system and this results in a 'vanilla' version of the software that acts as a reference platform for developers and tech enthusiasts." Google said a base 16GB version of the device would cost $349 in the US (£299 in the UK), unlocked and without a contract. The 32GB version should cost $399 (£339 in the UK). With Android Kitkat, Google said it had made the software use less memory so it could be used on handsets with much lower specifications than top end smartphones. In addition, Google has begun moving some services off Android's core software and onto its app store. Many see this as a way for it to maintain more control over the security of the software and its associated applications. </body>

      <body>An inner city primary is at the heart of a project to test how technology can be used to boost children's learning. Rosendale Primary, in south London, won a £253,000 grant for the research which will involve 1,400 pupils in 24 schools in London, Essex and Manchester. Rosendale pupils use tablet computers to photograph their work and tag it with notes about how well they learned. The Lambeth school's head teacher, Kate Atkins, says the aim is to help pupils develop a range of learning strategies. "Poor learners are often over-confident about the power of their memories and can struggle to find alternative strategies. "We need to encourage them to think about how they learn and to try something else." Children at the school are encouraged to reflect on every piece of work or unit of learning. They are asked to think about which bits went well, what they struggled with and what they might need to do to improve when they next revisit the subject. A key part of this is to ask children how they felt about each piece of work, for example many children find conducting a science experiment exciting and fun but hate having to sit down and write it up afterwards, says Ms Atkins. "An emotional reaction is a key part of the learning process." The research project aims to test whether the strategy actually improves pupils' attainment. It will be tested at 24 two-form-entry schools, one form will carry on as normal, the other will record and reflect on their learning using digital note-taking. Children will be tested at the start and finish of the project to measure their abilities and the results evaluated at Manchester University. The project is one of seven in a £3.5m strategy by the Education Endowment Foundation and Nominet Trust to evaluate the impact of technology in schools . The charities say the aim is to "rigorously test" new ways to use technology to improve attainment, particularly of less advantaged children. The grants will support 18,000 pupils in 260 schools across England. Another project, centred on Shireland Collegiate Academy in Sandwell, West Midlands, will test the effectiveness of a "flipped learning" approach. In effect pupils do their homework before the lesson, watching a video or web presentation on a new concept the night before. The lesson itself then focuses on a more detailed exploration of the concept, perhaps experimentation or discussion, and on helping struggling pupils. Dan Sutch of the Nominet Trust said: "The more we can understand where technology best supports learning and teaching the better." The Education Endowment Foundation said the grants would help identify the most effective ways to use digital technology to improve learning for the most disadvantaged pupils. Chairman Sir Peter Lampl said schools spent huge sums on technology but there was too little evidence of its effectiveness. "The gap in educational outcomes between rich and poor is the biggest barrier to social mobility we face and it is essential to find out if and how technology can be used to help close it." </body>

      <body>The website of Singapore's main paper, The Straits Times, has been hacked by someone who claimed to be a part of the hacking collective Anonymous. It comes just days after a person claiming to be part of the group posted an online video threatening to hit out at the country's infrastructure. The video protested Singapore's new licensing regulations for news sites. The hacker, dubbed The Messiah, said the paper's report on the video was misleading. The hacker left a comment on a section of the site saying: "Dear ST: You just got hacked for misleading the people!" The message alleged that the Straits Times reporter who blogged on the video "chose to conveniently modify the sentence 'war against the Singapore government' into 'war against Singapore'". "That in our opinion can be very misleading," the hacker posted. The post added "the media has also misled our intentions by stating that we had plans to attack the infrastructure of Singapore on the 5th of November". "That is ONLY our intention if the internet framework gets implemented. Not otherwise," it said. Under new rules, unveiled by the Media Development Authority earlier this year, sites "that report regularly on issues relating to Singapore and have significant reach among readers" require individual licences. Singapore Press Holdings, the firm the runs the Straits Times, said in a statement it had the taken down the affected blog from its site and also made a police report. The paper also reported that the government's IT Security Incident Response Team - set up to co-ordinate responses to a cyber intrusion, had alerted all government agencies after the video was posted on YouTube on Tuesday. It quoted the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore as saying that it was "aware of the video, and the police are investigating the matter". </body>

      <body>Aviation regulators have cleared the safe use of mobile devices during take-off and landing for US airlines. US carriers are expected to let passengers use smartphones, tablets, and e-book readers from gate to gate by the end of the year. Internet connections for email, web surfing, and downloading will be prohibited below 10,000 feet. Cellular voice calls will remain banned because of the possibility of radio interference with flight equipment. The changes to US regulations mean passengers will be able to read e-books, play games, and watch videos for the duration of domestic and international flights. Airlines will need to perform safety checks before changing their current policies on device use. Carriers must show the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that they can handle the effects that mobile devices have on flight instruments and avionics, and they must assess risks such as stowage problems. US airline Delta said it had submitted a plan to the regulator, and expected to let customers on domestic flights use personal electronic devices as early as 1 November. The relaxation of rules for US carriers may have a knock-on effect for UK airlines, a spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) told the BBC. UK regulators will study how the FAA rules can be applied to UK airlines. </body>

      <title>GPS bullets latest US police weapon</title>
      <description>US police are using a James Bond-like tool to make car chases safer and the firm behind the gadget wants to bring them to the UK.</description>

      <body>It sounds like something out of a James Bond movie - GPS bullets that can track the location of a suspect's car. The bullet is designed to make high-speed chases safer - enabling the authorities to track suspects without having to risk theirs or others' lives. And in true spy fashion the system works by hitting a button inside a police car. That triggers a lid to pop up releasing a bullet that shoots out and sticks to the car in front. The system, dubbed Starchase, is already in use in four US states - Iowa, Florida, Arizona and Colorado - and the firm behind it is now keen to get the system into the UK. It costs $5,000 (£3,108) to install and each bullet costs $500 (£312). Once the bullet is connected to a car, the police can stop the chase. They can track and pinpoint a suspect's vehicle location and speed in near real time. "This is an important tactic for the police. We've already made a difference, from rescuing little girls from human trafficking to stopping drivers under the influence," said Trevor Fischbach, president of StarChase. Dave Allen is a senior lecturer at Leeds University and recently co-authored a report into the future of technology for the UK police. "This sounds like interesting technology and there is a clear operational use for it. I think the costs will fall rapidly and we will see them being used routinely in the not so distant future," he told the BBC. But, he added, there needs to be pause for thought to make sure technology is not just being used for technology's sake. "There are other ways to track vehicles and this could raise some civil liberties issues," he said. </body>

      <title>Insect-like drone is 'crash happy'</title>
      <description>Flying robot Gimball has been designed to bounce off objects to cope with chaotic environments after a disaster</description>

      <body>An insect-like flying rescue robot that can bounce off trees and buildings has been revealed by its creators. Gimball has been developed to be used in situations that are hazardous to humans. The robot is designed to be able to deal with crashes, and to right itself after a collision. Gimball has a protective spherical roll-cage, and is mounted on pivots to stay upright. The flying robot, which bounces off walls, moves in a similar way to a mosquito. Gimball was in part inspired by the way insects fly, co-creator Adrien Briod told the BBC. "Usually robots need to move around obstacles, so we thought it would be interesting to allow it to sustain collisions," Mr Briod said. The drone, described as "crash happy", was designed and built by a team in Switzerland at the Ecole Polytechnique Federerale de Lausanne (EPFL). The robot was developed for use in disaster situations, such as entering a building on fire, or after a radiation leak. Normally flying robots are taken out of action by a major collision, but the designers did not think the problem could be solved by adding more sensors. To keep Gimball lightweight, the research team decided to allow the robot to ricochet off obstacles instead. The robot has a rotating flexible frame that lets it bounce off anything that it hits in a chaotic environment. To stay upright, Gimball has a gyroscopic system that includes an accelerometer, the same type of sensor as used in smartphones to let the phone know which way is up. The battery-driven robot has two propellers, and is steered by fins. It is fitted with a motion sensor, a camera, an altimeter, a magnetic compass and a micro-controller processor. The 34cm (13 inch) , 370g (13oz) drone can lift weights of up to 30g, so can carry gas or radioactivity sensors, Mr Briod said. The robot can be remotely controlled, but Mr Briod aims to eventually incorporate artificial intelligence capabilities into Gimball to allow it to accomplish complex tasks by itself. The team that built Gimball at the Laboratory of Intelligent Systems at EPFL included Mr Briod and engineer Mariusz Kornatowski. </body>

      <body>Kate Russell's weekly review of the best apps and websites. This week we take a look at some data visualisation tools that might help you understand your social networks a little more. Mentionapp connects to Twitter and lets you explore how users are linked to each other by the hashtags they use. Facebook fans can try Friend-wheel - an interesting visualisation that shows all the connections between your friends - you might be surprised to learn who knows who. And for all you LinkedIn fans, there is a visualisation tool that lays bare a colour-coded map of your contacts to see how they are all interlinked on this enormous business network. As well as being a social space, the web is great if you like to create and Sketchtoy serves up a fun platform for any freehand artists to try their hand and making something lovely in a wibbly-wobbly drawing style that is quite hypnotic. Another interesting sharing app which is available free on Apple and Android is Chirp.io. This unique system uses a burst of sound - a bit like birdsong - to transmit the data required to share an image to any phones using the app within hearing range. A burst of chirp and the image instantly appears on the other phone. Music fans should set a reminder for a first this weekend. YouTube - the site that made Justin Bieber famous - is launching its own music awards. The event will be headlined by Lady Gaga and streamed live on 3 November 2013.

The screens, manufactured by Lord Sugar's digital sign company Amscreen, will have an inbuilt camera to identify a customer's age and gender and will then play targeted advertisements. A Tesco spokesperson said the technology does not use facial recognition software, have eyeball scanners, record data or identify customers in any way - it simply estimates age and gender. Technology expert Tom Cheesewright told BBC Radio 5 live's Richard Bacon: "So much of this stuff happens today online already and you don't even know it.

      <body>A new word has suddenly become wildly popular in China - "tuhao" - which loosely translated means "nouveau riche". There have been more than 100 million references to the word "tuhao" on social media since early September. It's being used to describe everything from the Communist Party's new People's Daily building, to expensive celebrity weddings full of bling, and the new gold-coloured iPhone. In Chinese "tu" means earth, and "hao" means rich. To say someone is tuhao is to imply they come from a poor peasant background, and have made it rich quick - but don't quite have the manners, or sophistication to go along with it. It's like the term "nouveau riche", says Professor Steve Tsang at the School of Contemporary Chinese Studies in Nottingham - but has even more negative connotations, suggesting a certain vulgarity. "Tuhao" is actually an old word - dating back perhaps as far as the Southern Dynasty 1,500 years ago - but it has always meant something rather different. During the communist revolution, from the 1920s to early 1950s, it was widely used to refer to landholders and gentry who would bully those beneath them. This new usage of the term took off in September after a widely-shared joke about a rich, but unhappy man, who goes to a Buddhist monk for advice, expecting to be told to live a more simple life. The monk replies instead with the phrase: "Tuhao, let's be friends!" Chinese internet users are highly creative in their use of language, and are constantly inventing, and re-inventing words as a way of getting past censorship rules, says Tsang. But in this case, its popularity seems to be down to the fact that it encapsulates China's changing society so well - many people sneer at those with wealth, but are secretly jealous, says Tsang.

      <body>Back in the 1970s, Steve Jobs met Steve Wozniak, and the rest, if you like, is history. The two became firm friends and although Steve Jobs often gets the credit for Apple's success, it was Woz, as he's known, who was the brains behind the silicon. He spoke to the BBC's technology programme Click. Computers are on the verge of understanding human gestures and speech, but it has not yet been perfected. Wozniak says he often finds Android human speech recognition software is more accurate than Apple's Siri. "Sometimes I say 'Go to Joe's Diner' and [Siri] doesn't know where Joe's Diner is. And very often usually I find out that Android does." Wozniak says this is due to Android's access to Google's search engine. "That is actually the future of intelligence probably for computers getting smarter and getting artificial intelligence. I wish to God that Apple and Google were partners in the future." But how likely would a partnership between the two companies be? "I don't know. If I were there, it would be pretty likely. I'm probably wrong, there's probably an awful lot I don't know about the business concerns and one thing you've got to remember is a company has always got to make money," says Wozniak. Encouraging openness and sharing information and methods would benefit everyone to develop the best technology, Wozniak says. "I believe you should have a world where you've got to license something at a fair price. There are good things I see on Samsung phones that I wish were in my iPhone. I wish Apple would use them and could use them, and I don't know if Samsung would stop us," he says. "I wish everybody just did a lot of cross-licensing and sharing the good technology, all our products would be better, we'd go further. I do wish they were more compatible." Wozniak believes more sharing between companies would lead to developments in bigger and better technology in wearable tech, like smartwatches and augmented reality glasses. "I want a full smartphone-like capability on my wrist. The trouble is the more I think about it, I don't want the small size. "We're just at the verge of having products that have foldability and flexibility," he says. "For about three or four years I've been talking about organic LED displays that could be theoretically printed on plastic, wrapped and folded," he says. "But think outside of the box. It could be on the inside of your arm and then when you flip your arm up it could actually flip open into your own hand." Despite his legacy, Wozniak is not seen as an Apple insider these days. But he is still beloved by many of the Mac faithful. "His comments aren't influential in any shape or form. He was one of the founders of Apple and walked away, so the fan boys love him. He is free to say anything he likes," says Stuart Miles, founder of technology news website Pocket-lint. "I don't think he has any insight or influence into the inner workings of how Apple works. But nonetheless he is a fascinating storyteller," he says.

      <title>Facebook beheading: Who was the woman?</title>
      <description>Who was Mexico's Jane Doe?</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-24772724</url>
      <date>1383525760</date>

      <body>A film of a woman being beheaded in Mexico caused an international outcry in October when Facebook refused to remove it from its site. There have been hundreds of reports about the video - but why has no-one identified the victim in it? In the grainy footage, the woman is on her knees in jeans and a pink top, before a masked man holding a knife behind her says in a gruff voice: "Well, gentleman, this is what happens to all those in the Gulf Cartel. On behalf of Los Zetas." The rest of the video is a gruesome 40 seconds of cold-blooded murder, which caused international controversy recently when it was posted on Facebook. "Irresponsible" was the word used by the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, about the social network's policy permitting the video to be uploaded. After a day or so of impassioned debate on both sides, Facebook reversed its decision and took the video down. Needless to say, it is still easy enough to find online, especially in Mexico. There are numerous websites dedicated to uploading videos of "narco-killings" or executions similar to the Facebook example. Yet despite the fact the victim is clearly identifiable and that presumably someone somewhere in Mexico must recognise her - as their wife, daughter or sister - no-one has come forward to name her. As far as the BBC has been able to ascertain, there is no investigation under way in Mexico to establish the woman's identity, or find the culprits of her murder. "The place to start [such an investigation] is with the municipal police," says Dr George Grayson, one of world's authorities on Los Zetas and author of the book, The Executioner's Men, about the criminal organisation. The problem, he says, is that although many municipal police officers may work for the public during the day - and sometimes even that is questionable - at night they work for the cartel. As such, he says, fear is a powerful tool used by both the Zetas and their rivals. "People are reluctant to report crimes, even heinous crimes. State forces are not much better in terms of their corruption and their collaboration with the cartels." Meanwhile, the unfortunate lady in the controversial film continues to be nameless and with no known identity - a "Jane Doe", reminiscent of dozens, perhaps hundreds of others who met a grisly end on camera in Mexico. In the case of the Facebook victim, one is faced with an even more basic problem when trying to identify her. Based on the non-descript wasteland in the video clip, it is almost impossible to establish where in Mexico she was killed and therefore which local authorities are responsible for investigating her murder. In essence, the act could have happened almost anywhere in the country where there is drug-related violence. Los Zetas' and Gulf Cartel's areas of influence, Oct 2013 QandA: Mexico's drug-related violence Stratfor: Cartel influence map "This gets to the heart of one of Mexico's biggest dramas - and that's the issue of investigation," says newspaper columnist, Julian Andrade, who has also published a number of books on the drug war. "Remember that statistics show we have a 96-98% rate of impunity. The majority of crimes are never going to be investigated here in Mexico. This is the profound problem - that even high profile cases like this one which make an impact in the world's media still reflect the incapacity of the authorities to carry out investigations." The BBC was due to interview the National Security Commissioner in Mexico, Manuel Mondragon, to pose questions about security and the investigation into the beheading which appeared on Facebook. Despite repeated requests, the security commissioner's office has still not granted us an interview or made any comment on the video. It may be the case, of course, that the woman in the film was deeply entrenched in the drug war as an active member of the Gulf Cartel, as her killer intimated before the attack. But George Grayson says it is almost impossible to know for sure what her supposed crime against Los Zetas was. "Often these ghoulish events take the form of settling scores against someone who has offended Los Zetas or is in conflict with Los Zetas," he says. It's possible she was just a relative or friend of a member of a rival drug gang, and was killed for revenge. He recounts a story he has written about in the past in which a woman in Nuevo Laredo, said to be an informant, was allegedly beaten to death by the sadistic former leader of Los Zetas, Miguel Angel Trevino or "Z-40", in front of an assembled group of corrupt policemen, sending out a clear message not to cross the cartel. "Twenty to 25 years ago, women were involved in the narco-trade but you typically didn't kill women. Now all the rules have changed and the Zetas have been the main impulse in changing the rules." Despite the reams of words written about the Facebook beheading video, seemingly no-one asked the basic question, "Who was this woman?" If her execution is now considered so normal in today's Mexico that it doesn't even merit an investigation, in the final analysis, it is perhaps this - rather than any decision by Facebook - that is the most "irresponsible" element of this brutal killing.

      <body>The latest generation of camera-equipped drones offers the chance to take the kinds of photos once only available to helicopter pilots. The BBC's Kim Gittleson asks if the drones of the future will be panorama picture takers, not predators. On a recent windy autumn day in New York City, I tagged along with Colin Guinn, the chief innovation officer at DJI, to Washington Square Park in lower Manhattan. DJI, explained Mr Guinn, is a firm that develops and engineers small unmanned aerial vehicles that are meant to carry cameras. Drones, basically, that carry cameras instead of guns. Stopping just in front of the park's iconic arch, he placed a black suitcase on a bench and pulled out what appeared to be a very elaborate toy helicopter. White and about the size of a large textbook, I was informed this was actually the Phantom 2 Vision - DJI's latest drone. It has four detachable propellers to help keep the camera, which hangs from its middle, stable when it's up in the air. After giving me some basic instructions on how to use the remote control - two joysticks with a smartphone acting as a real-time viewer - off I went. Suddenly, it was like seeing through the eyes of a bird. The app on the smartphone beamed back breathtaking images using the wireless router attached to the Phantom's belly. Jaded New Yorkers stopped and formed a small crowd as the Phantom buzzed overhead, crowding around to look at the screen. When one man asked where he could get one, he reacted with surprise when Mr Guinn answered: "Just go up the street to BandH", referring to the US high street electronics superstore. The man's surprise turned to shock when he heard how much they cost: "$1,199 each." Long used in American military operations overseas, the technology of drones - or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as the industry calls them - has come home, and at a price significantly less than the tens of thousands of dollars spent on army operations. Obviously, they are also serving a more benign use. Hobbyists have been making their own hand-crafted versions, using cobbled together bits of metal and wires for almost a decade. But now new, cheaper camera technology has attracted a slew of start-ups aiming to capitalise on consumer interest in aerial photos. A recent industry study by research firm the Teal Group found that the worldwide commercial drone market could top $89bn (£55bn) in the next 10 years. "We're kind of in that early adopters stage right now and even the tip of this iceberg is very big," says Mr Guinn. "People are not recognising that as cameras get better, being able to make really spectacular videos is something a lot of people want to do," says Chris Anderson, who quit his job as head of Wired magazine to start a company called 3D Robotics after the enthusiastic response he saw for drones within the do-it-yourself community. Since its founding in 2009, he says 3D Robotics has increased sales by 100% each year to become a multi-million dollar firm. It recently raised $30m in funding. The trick, he says, is making technology that is both affordable and easy to use, likening drone technology to videogames. "Once you have that level of simplicity using devices that we all own and are comfortable with then you could sell in the millions," he says. However, an appealing vision of the future to some can be an Orwellian nightmare to others. Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, says while his organisation has been wary of government use of drones, in private hands, the issue is more complicated. "The courts have pretty much found that you have a constitutional right to take pictures of things in public places [and] I think we would extend that to drones," he says. He adds that so-called "peeping Tom" laws prohibiting neighbourly spying would almost certainly apply to inappropriate drone use as well. "If you put a ladder up to your neighbour's second-story bedroom window and look in, I don't think that's any different than using a drone to do the same thing - I think the law will cover both equally," he says. Mr Guinn of DJI says that it's not privacy concerns he's most worried about, but US regulations regarding unmanned aerial vehicles. "The big concern is just safely integrating [drones] into the national airspace," he says. For many drone manufacturers, this is the crucial issue. Right now, guidelines put out by the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) ban the use of drones in American airspace for commercial purposes - i.e. for anything other than the sort of hobbyist flying that I did with Mr Guinn in Washington Square Park. Commercial applications include selling drones to police for law enforcement and to farmers to help them monitor crops. The service ban exists because according to the FAA, the US has the most congested airspace in the world. It has said that it plans to release new rules by 2015 that could open up US airspace to drones. The agency estimates that 10,000 new drones could be in flight in the first few years after the ban is lifted. But at the moment, it's the hobbyist firms like DJI, Parrot and 3D Robotics that are growing the fastest. Both DJI and 3D Robotics are coming out with a slew of new models in time for the Christmas period. DJI's Phantom 2 Vision will be sold for $1,199, and 3D Robotics says it plans to sell its new Iris model for around $800. "I'd love it to be likened to the DSLR revolution," says Mr Guinn, referring to high-end cameras. "When they started shooting video, that changed the face of independent filmmaking. We want to do the same with aerials." </body>

      <body>"One thing about data in Africa is that there's a huge lack of it," says Jasper Grosskurth, managing director of Research Solutions Africa, a pan-African research firm based in Nairobi, Kenya. "If there is data, it's usually unreliable and dubious," he continues. For example, in 2010 Ghana announced it had changed its base year for calculating gross domestic product (GDP) from 1993 to 2006, and overnight the country's GDP jumped 60%. "Suddenly Ghana was much richer than we thought it was," explains Morten Jerven, author of Poor Numbers: How We Are Misled by African Development Statistics and What to Do about It. Much of the problem, he says, is that African governments have not put statistics at the forefront of policy and institutional reform agendas, leaving the private sector and non-governmental organisations to fill in the gaps. Yet the uncoordinated demands and needs from both sectors have resulted in fragmented collection of data. Africa's middle class is rapidly rising, fuelling the second fastest growing economic bloc in the world. According to the World Bank's most recent Africa Pulse report, consumer spending accounted for more than 60% of sub-Saharan Africa's economic growth last year. Companies are scrambling to get in on this growth, but one big barrier remains - how to gather reliable market information, insights and opinions from across the continent. For many research firms, traditional data collection has involved sending a fleet of researchers out with pen and paper to all corners of a country. But this is still the old-fashioned "Land Rover" methodology, says Nathan Eagle, founder and chief executive of Jana, a US-based company that powers one of the world's largest reward-for-survey platforms in emerging markets, mCent. "You've got to get into an old Land Rover and head out into the field," he says, which is both expensive and time consuming. "[But] with the advent of mobile phones, that is shifting." Jana's platform integrates directly into the billing systems of 237 mobile operators, enabling 3.48 billion people in emerging markets to be rewarded with airtime for taking part in surveys. Users sign up for Jana through a mobile-friendly website or Facebook app, enter their information, and pick what surveys they qualify for. After completing the survey, airtime - ranging from 50 US cents to $5 (30p to £3) - is automatically credited to their phone. The idea, says Mr Eagle, is to offer financial compensation for users that matches the valuable data they are offering to market research companies - data that would be much more expensive to obtain in other ways. "We have millions of people across sub-Saharan Africa, and we're just scratching the surface here," he says. "We have far more supply than demand for market research." Earlier this year, Jana helped CNN International to find out what Africans thought about the possibility of an African Pope. They surveyed 20,000 people across 11 countries over four days. (In case you're wondering, 51% felt an African Pope would be more conservative than previous Popes). "It was an experiment for us," explains Peter Bale, vice president and general manager of CNN International Digital. "We're experiencing high rates of growth in CNN consumption in Africa, particularly through mobile devices. So we needed to look at how we tap into that. "It's a proper means of exchange," he adds. "Fifty cents of airtime for six questions, and we got a tremendous flow of information." Although Jana rewards users through mobile airtime, users need an internet connection to fill out the surveys. The vast majority of mobile phones in Africa are feature phones, which can access the internet, but are generally sluggish in browsing and have high data costs. In most cases in Africa, Mr Eagle says, users pay to go to local internet cafes, which could also cost them part of their reward. Yet another company is addressing this problem with a different approach. BiNu, an Australian firm launched in 2011, is a platform that gives basic mobile feature phones essentially smartphone-like capabilities by offloading all the processing to a cloud-based server, which offers an app store. "It's like your smartphone in the cloud," says Gour Lentell, BiNu's co-founder. This makes it cheaper and faster to browse on feature phones. Through BiNu's "Research and Rewards" platform, customers are prompted to opt in to receive surveys and questionnaires, for which they are rewarded with BiNu "credits", convertible to music, books or airtime. While this type of research could be, and is being, done via text message - through companies like GeoPoll - texts have their limitations. "The predominant way you'd reach consumers in emerging markets is SMS, because it works on every phone," explains Mr Lentell. "But it's cumbersome and slow, and the types of questions you can post, length of text and methods of collection responses is limited." Digital may be a fast and efficient way to collect and analyse big data on the continent, but is the data deep enough to replace the old Land Rover methodology? It depends, says Jasper Grosskurth of Research Solutions Africa. "The problem with [digital] panels and response rates is that often all you know about the respondents is gender, age, and location or country," he says. "So if I want to run a well-balanced, representative survey, that's tough. It's not as randomised." Although digital is cheaper, and perhaps better for basic opinion polls - like thoughts on an African Pope - if you want to thoroughly evaluate a development project, for example, "it won't work". Nevertheless, small and medium-sized businesses are keen to take advantage of the benefits that digital can offer. "The average consumer in Kenya makes seven to eight payments a day, even the poorest ones," explains Dylan Higgins, chief executive of Kopo Kopo, a Kenya-based start-up. "Those transactions are happening, but they've largely been anonymous to date." While companies like BiNu and Jana use mobile phones to help big brands find new information from potential or existing consumers, Kopo Kopo aims to find what data already exists, and make it available to local businesses. M-Pesa, the mobile money service that launched in Kenya in 2007, now has more than 17 million users. Kopo Kopo captures all of a firm's untracked M-Pesa transactions, and digitises them into a dashboard for business owners to better understand and engage with their customers. Once businesses are aware of their customers' profiles and spending habits, they can engage with them through offers, rewards, surveys and more. "A lot of global brands are entering the African market, but there are also a number of brands developing in this market that could become regional or global," says Mr Higgins. "It's a democratising tool that levels the playing field. As much as I would love to work with the larger brands, why should they be the only ones who can afford to understand and engage their customers?" </body>

      <title>Si Shen: Rebuilding Papaya Mobile</title>
      <description>The mobile game that survived falling off Apple's shop</description>
      <url>http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-24749575</url>

      <body>Does the entrepreneurial spirit run in families? One company founder who thinks it might is Si Shen, of Papaya Mobile, which produces games for mobile phones. Si Shen was born and grew up in China. Her mother was a successful lawyer, but she was not satisfied with her lot. Whilst she was still a child, her family moved to Shenzhen in southern China, an area known as a hot spot of business activity, where her mother started a real estate enterprise. When she was growing up, Ms Shen says that like many other Chinese children she dreamt of becoming a scientist. But as she grew older and thought more deeply about what she wanted to do with her life, she began to have other ideas. Her mother's example influenced her heavily. Ms Shen recalls that she read a lot of books, and one that made a big impact on her was The Road Ahead by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. "He had a dream when he was really young, 'I want everybody to be able to have a computer, a personal computer on their desk.' And because of this dream, he changed the world." She remembers thinking: "That's so cool! I want to do something like that!" Ms Shen studied at the prestigious Tshingua University in Beijing, and subsequently at Stanford University in California. By this time she was certain she wanted to start a technology company. At a party she met a fellow graduate of Tshingua who had become a successful entrepreneur. He advised her that before starting something herself, she needed to gain some business experience first. Ms Shen applied for a post at Google but she never lost sight of her ultimate goal. At the interview she was asked what she expected to be doing in five years' time. She replied that she would not still be working for Google, saying "I'm going to be in China and I'm going to be working on my own company." She got the job. After working as a product manager for Google for several years, she left and returned to Beijing where she and a friend launched Papaya in 2008. They decided to concentrate on the mobile phone market. After trying various avenues, they settled on games as being a sector that showed particular promise. At the time in China there was a computer game called Happy Farm that was extraordinarily popular. Its success inspired Ms Shen and her colleagues to try to produce a similar game that could be played on mobile phones, such as Apple's iPhone. The game was called Papaya Farm and it proved to be a turning point. "All of a sudden it went really, really popular - and we got millions of users." Things went well for the business until late 2009, when Ms Shen received a frantic call telling her that all the company's games had suddenly been removed from Apple's App Store. As this happened during the Thanksgiving holiday in the US, she could not reach anyone at Apple to find out what was going on. The news could not have come at a worse time, because the start-up was trying to raise funds for expansion. "Our investors told us, 'If your products don't get back to the App Store, we're not going to give you the money.' That was a very serious situation," she remembers. "I couldn't sleep because we have 15 employees. Everybody was looking at me every day. They were like, 'What are we going to do?' and I couldn't give them an answer." She decided to fly to the US, more specifically to Apple's headquarters in Cupertino in California, and spent the day waiting in the reception area. Eventually, she spoke to a company executive, who explained that there were some technical issues with Papaya's games. "Basically if we didn't change the whole infrastructure of our games, there was no way we could go back to iPhone," she recalls. She was devastated. Her investors pulled out and she knew she had to do something fast. She quickly decided to take the risk of moving Papaya's games to a different mobile phone system, Google's Android platform. She took the chance because although Android was just getting established at the time, she knew "it was going to be big". Her bet paid off. Papaya's games proved popular on phones running the Android system. Later, after making some technical changes, the company's games were allowed back on sale through Apple's App Store. Ms Shen says she learnt a lot from the episode, gaining a better understanding of how the business world works and the dangers of putting all your eggs in one basket. "As a start-up, you cannot just rely on one platform, because one day if that platform tells you 'no', then you lose everything. You have to have back-up." She has also learned a lot about herself. Until then her whole business experience had been very smooth, and she had not known "the taste of failure". "That taught me that no matter what happens, if you believe what you are doing - just be persistent, anything can be overcome." </body>

      <title>Flying car dream is becoming reality</title>
      <description>Why flying cars may finally be ready for launch</description>

      <body>In 1940 Henry Ford famously said: "Mark my word: A combination airplane and motorcar is coming. You may smile, but it will come." Just nine years later Moulton Taylor had designed and flown his Aerocar, proving the viability of Ford's fantastical concept. But only three models were ever built, and the dream of a viable vehicle that can offer freedom both in the air and on the road has remained frustratingly elusive. Until now that is. Technology - "sense and avoid" avionics, computer-aided design, and materials science - has advanced to such a degree that safety authorities are tantalisingly close to giving full approval to flying cars. "Since the Wright Brothers and Henry Ford we've had the dream of marrying the plane and the car," said Dick Knapinski, spokesman for the US Experimental Aircraft Association, "but engineering, regulatory and cultural hurdles have always got in the way. "Now we are really getting closer to making the dream come true." For example, in July this year, Boston-based company Terrafugia showed off its Transition "roadable aircraft" at the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) AirVenture event in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. "We have an experimental airworthiness certificate from the FAA [US Federal Aviation Authority] which means we still have to stay away from populated areas," said Richard Gersh, Terrafugia's vice-president of business development, "but everything is going to plan to achieve full certification." The Transition, whose wings fold up against the body of the carriage, is also licensed for testing on the road, but Mr Gersh emphasises its primary function is as an aircraft. "We don't envisage this replacing your family car, and you'll always have to take off and land at an airport," he said. "But it does give you the flexibility of driving to the airport and to your destination at the other end." When the Transition eventually goes on sale - which could be in two years, depending on how long full safety certification takes - it will retail for about $280,000 (£173,000), slightly cheaper than a Cessna Skyhawk fixed-wing plane. The company has already received more than 100 orders, said Mr Gersh. Les Dorr, FAA spokesman, told the BBC: "If a 'flying car' is intended to operate on US highways then the vehicle has to conform to both the applicable US Department of Transportation standards for a car and the applicable aviation standards for an aircraft. "Terrafugia is the only US aircraft certification project that has obtained an exemption or for which we've defined the certification requirements with both the FAA and NHTSA [National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]." Looking to the future, Terrafugia's concept craft - the TF-X - will incorporate vertical take-off and landing thanks to hinged propellers on the foldable wings combined with a rear propeller for forward propulsion. It will be a plug-in hybrid electric flying car promising a top speed of 200mph (320km/h) and a range of about 500 miles. The company envisages incorporating existing autopilot and new sense-and-avoid technology to help it steer clear of air traffic, bad weather and restricted airspace. It will also include a full parachute system in case of total engine failure, and an auto-land capability if the pilot becomes incapacitated. But Mr Gersh estimates that the TF-X is "about eight to 10 years away" from becoming a reality. Another US outfit, the Indigenous Peoples' Technology and Education Center (I-TEC), has developed the Maverick LSA, a rough terrain buggy that can fly using a rear propeller and parachute combination. Built by Beyond Roads, it is designed to aid humanitarian missions to difficult-to-reach areas. The parachute is hoisted up a flexible mast to prevent it fouling the rear propeller. At the moment, the vehicle is treated as a "kit car" for regulatory purposes and also has a Special Light Sport Aircraft airworthiness certificate. Stefan Klein, co-founder and chief designer at Slovakian firm Aeromobil, caught the flying car bug as a child after watching the French filmFantomas se Dechaine, featuring a Citroen DS that could turn into a rocket-powered plane. A graduate of the Slovak University of Technology and a former head of research projects for Audi, Volkswagen and BMW at the Academy of Fine Arts and Design, he comes from a family of aviators and has spent about 20 years trying to make his dream come true. The svelte-looking "pre-prototype" 2.5, which made its debut flight in Montreal in September this year, is potentially the shape of things to come. With hinged wings that sweep forward for flight, a top air speed of more than 200km/h (124mph) and flight range of 700km (430 miles), the Aeromobil certainly looks like a credible player in the nascent flying car market. But spokeswoman Tatiana Veberova admits: "We haven't even begun to solve the problem of certification yet. We have a long way to go." The 3.0 prototype is likely to be ready in 2014, she said, and the company intends to target the US market where regulatory acceptance is more advanced than in Europe. So technology is finally making flying cars a viable product for the mass market, and regulators are certainly catching up with the speed of development. But are we really ready for motorways in the sky? "Lots of people are still afraid of flying," says Mr Knapinksi at the EAA. "There's a mystery about it. That's also part of its joy. "Gaining cultural acceptance for flying cars will be the last hurdle to overcome." </body>

      <description>Rare glimpse of one of the most sophisticated US spy planes</description>

      <body>The Global Hawk is one of the US military's most sophisticated spy planes and the BBC was able to get a rare view of one at Grand Forks Airbase in North Dakota. It can travel halfway round the world on a single tank of fuel and can track a man on the ground, even when the earth is covered by cloud, from a height of about 18,000m - that's close to 60,000ft. That means it could in theory peer into Syria to track chemical weapons while still flying in international airspace. Or keep track of North Korea's nuclear programme flying from the Pacific island of Guam. The man in charge of operations at Grand Forks, Colonel Lawrence Spinetta, says the Hawk "spans the globe on a daily basis, 24-7, providing some great intelligence for senior decision makers", though he won't be drawn on details. The use of drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft, as the US Military prefers to call them, is highly controversial, not least because of the clandestine killings carried out by armed CIA drones, such as the Reaper and Predator. Some Americans are worried about the way drones can be used to carry out surveillance at home; 17 US states have passed laws limiting their use. But North Dakota, which is sparsely populated and has wide-open empty spaces, appears more relaxed. The University of North Dakota is one of the first in the US to offer a degree course in how to operate drones. While the Global Hawk is not armed there is still a lot of secrecy surrounding its use. At Grand Forks airbase, there is still little sign that the US military is about to lift the lid. The crew of the United States Air Force (USAF) even remove their name badges to avoid identification. We were asked to leave any recording devices, cameras or phones behind as we were shown one of the "shelters" from which the Global Hawk is flown. Outside it looks like a shipping container. Inside, there are banks of screens, though for this visit they had all been switched off. The Operations Room, which oversees missions, is firmly out of bounds behind a heavy door with a secure entry code. We are, however, allowed to witness a pilot carry out a simulated mission from his desk. One of the pilots admits he misses what he calls the "seat-of-the-pants feeling" you get while in the air. He says "it's not as exciting as flying a manned aircraft", but adds that it is rewarding in other ways. The aircrew speak positively about being able to fly missions anywhere in the world without leaving the comforts of home or the family behind. That is perhaps one reason why a pilot can feel "a little detached", even if he or she is totally focused on the mission. But these unmanned aircraft are the future. The Nato alliance doesn't usually purchase its own military hardware but its members have clubbed together to buy five Global Hawks at a cost of $1.7bn (1.2bn euros). By 2017 they will be flying out of Sigonella in Sicily with the potential to cover maritime security as well as supporting troops on the ground. Those who manufacture drones are keen to highlight their utility beyond the battlefield. Bob Zeiser, who helps run the Global Hawk programme at Northrop Grumman, says the Global Hawk has been involved in helping out in the aftermath of natural disasters. In 2010, one flew over Haiti following a devastating earthquake, where it mapped the devastation and helped direct rescue efforts. It was able to conduct the mission from California and survey the entire country three times before returning to base. More recently, a Global Hawk was used to assess the damage to the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan. Mr Zeiser acknowledges there's still a challenge in winning around the public, but he says the negative perceptions can be overcome by showing the public that drones are safe to fly and that they are a good way of keeping people out of harm's way. But there are still plenty of questions as to how drones can be safely integrated into civilian airspace and how the rest of us feel about being watched by an unblinking eye in the sky. </body>
